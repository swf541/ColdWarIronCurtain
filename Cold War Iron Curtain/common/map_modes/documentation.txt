# scripted map modes can be used to add new map modes to game_map_mode_factions
# 
# example:
# 
#scripted_map_modes = {
# test_map_mode = {
#	# the game will use name of the map mode for some strings:
#	# MAPMODE_TEST_MAP_MODE MAPMODE_TEST_MAP_MODE_NAME MAPMODE_TEST_MAP_MODE_DESCRIPTION as name & desc
#	# test_map_mode_tooltip & test_map_mode_tooltip_delayed for tooltips
#	# GFX_mapmode_buttons_deselected_small_test_map_mode GFX_mapmode_buttons_selected_small_test_map_mode for the icons
#
# 	# there are two layers for a map mode. bottom & top
# 	# both are same except during rendering they will be rendered in that order
#	# for each layer the game will figure out what borders to render and will ask script to pick a color for those
# 	top = {
# 	
# 		# type represents which borders will be used for rendering for this layer
# 		# or it can represent one of the hard coded map mode layers
# 		# must be one of following:
# 		#   none #will render nothing for this layer
# 		#   country #will render using country provinces
# 		#   state #will render using state provinces
# 		#   state_controller #will render using state provinces & controllers. if a state is shared between countries it will be called for each country
# 		
# 		#   game_map_mode_country (these are hard coded map mode layers. if these are used all other layer entries are ignored)
# 		#   game_map_mode_states
# 		#   game_map_mode_diplomacy
# 		#   game_map_mode_players
# 		#   game_map_mode_factions
# 		#   game_map_mode_ideology
# 		type = country
# 		
# 		# this trigger will be used for setting the color of a specific border
# 		# if trigger returns true then it will render that border
# 		# scope depends on type of the layer
# 		# scope is player
# 		# from scope depends on type
# 		#   country: current country that will be rendered
# 		#   state: current state that will be rendered
# 		#   state_controller: current state that will be rendered and from from scope will be the controller of current portion of the state
# 		# if return value is true the game expects you to set some temp variables which will be used as border color etc
# 		
# 		color = {
# 			set_temp_variable = { red = 0.0 }
# 			set_temp_variable = { blue = 1.0 }
# 			set_temp_variable = { green = 0.0 }
# 			set_temp_variable = { alpha = 1.0 }
# 			
# 			# only needed if thickness = yes on parent
# 			# specify layer thickness
# 			set_temp_variable = { thickness = 10.0 }
# 			
# 			# if set border will pulsate
# 			set_temp_variable = { highlighted = 1.0 }
# 			
# 			#always = yes
# 		}
# 		
# 		
# 		# a target list that can be used to limit which scopes will be rendered on map
# 		# similar to targeted decisions
# 		# highly recommended for perfomance, otherwise it will try to render for every scope
# 		targets = {
# 			#target_array = robot_map_icon_array
# 			#targets
# 			#target_trigger
# 			#... everything targeted decisions support
# 		}

# 
# 	# if we want to show texts on map this you can set far_text & near_text
# 	# must be one of the:
# 	#  none
# 	#  country
# 	#  state
# 	#  faction
# 	#  player
#
