# Policy database for Military Industrial Organization (MIO)
#
# For each MIO, the player is able to attach 1 policy to get extra bonuses.
# 1 policy is similar to 1 trait. The bonuses only applies to the equipment variant or production line the MIO is assigned to.
# 
# This database defines a list of policies, and for each MIO, the triggers will be evaluated to compute the list of eligible policies.
#
# Example with all possible parts:
# my_policy_token = {
#	name = loc_key # optional
#	# if name provided, use loc_key
#	# if loc key TAG_my_MIO_token exists, use it (where TAG is the tag of the MIO owner)
#	# else use loc key my_MIO_token
#	# loc key may use scripted loc, scope will be set with the country owning the policy
#
#	icon = GFX_key # optional
#	# if icon provided, use GFX_key
#	# if gfx key GFX_TAG_my_MIO_token exists, use it (where TAG is the tag of the MIO owner)
#	# if gfx key GFX_my_MIO_token exists, use it
#	# else use GFX_idea_unknown
#

#	cooldown = 60 # optional, default is DEFAULT_INITIAL_ATTACH_POLICY_COOLDOWN
#
#	allowed = { ... } # mandatory
#   # MIO scope
#   # allowed is evaluated when starting the game for all MIOs
#   # if trigger returns false, the policy will never be considered for this MIO later in-game
#
#	visible = { ... } # optional, default is always = yes
#   # current MIO scope
#   # visible is evaluated when displaying the MIO UIs / policy screen

#
#	available = { ... } # optional, default is always = yes
#   # current MIO scope
#   # available is evaluated when displaying the MIO UIs / policy screen
#   # if trigger returns false, then the policy is visible but disabled and greyed-out
