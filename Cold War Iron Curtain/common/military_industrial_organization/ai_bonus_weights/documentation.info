#	AI Bonus Weights
#
#	This database contains numbers that influence how much each trait bonus
#	affects the desire of the AI to pick traits with that bonus.
#
#	The format is very simple:
#
#	equipment_archetype = {
#		bonus_1 = weight
#		bonus_2 = weight
#		bonus_3 = weight
#		...
#	}
#
#	For example:
#
#	infantry_equipment = {
#		# Prefer infantry equipment with high air superiority bonus!
#		air_superiority = 9.999
#	}
#
#	Each bonus will affect the desire of the AI greater the greater the value
#	of the bonus.
#
#	Every bonus used by any of the MIOs should have a weight. If no archetype-
#	specific weight is provided for a bonus, the default value will be used.
#	Default values live in their own section:
#
#	default = {
#		bonus_1 = weight
#		bonus_2 = weight
#		bonus_3 = weight
#		...
#	}
#
#	If neither archetype-specific nor default value is provided, the game will
#	log an error.
