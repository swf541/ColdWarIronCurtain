# Equipment Group Database
#
# The purpose of this database is to be able to group various equipment types
# into categories while optionally providing a reasonably short description.
#
# For example:
#
# useless_junk = {
#	description = "Useless Junk" # optional, this can be a loc key
#	equipment_type = {
#		light_tank_chassis_0 # this can be a type, an archetype or a category
#		light_tank_chassis_1
#		...
#	}
# }
#
# You can also include existing groups in the equipment type list:
#
# useless_junk_plus_carriers = {
#	equipment_type = {
#		useless_junk
#		carrier
#	}
# }
#
