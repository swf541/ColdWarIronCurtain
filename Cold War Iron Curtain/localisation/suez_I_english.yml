 suezcrisis.1.d:0 "Today the Egyptian government has decided to unilaterally abrogate the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. This was met with great alarm as many suspect that Egypt has its eyes on seizing the canal."
 suezcrisis.2.d:0 "Today the Suez Canal is being rightfully seized and the Imperialists will be ousted from the canal! Egyptian forces have entered the canal and took control of it. The government quickly declared the nationalization of the Suez Canal. The imperialists are reeling over the news but we believe that they are too powerless to stop us."
 suezcrisis.3.d:0 "Our fears over the fate of the Suez Canal have been realized as Egypt has seized and nationalized the Suez Canal. This is an unprecedented danger to our economy and international prestige, we have to act."
 suezcrisis.4.d:0 "Egypt has outrageously nationalized the Suez Canal, putting our trade routes in severe danger. We are not alone in the panic as the British are suffering the brunt of the blow. We decided to start working with the British on a plan to undo the nationalization of the canal, Egypt can't get away with this."
 suezcrisis.5.d:0 "While Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, putting international trade in danger, they have also decided to blockade a vital trade route for us, the Straits of Tiran, blocking our ships from trading with the outside world. We can't allow this to continue, we must stop this somehow."
 suezcrisis.6.d:0 "The US, fearing an escalation of the situation, has hosted an international conference in order to solve the crisis. Many countries stood their ground in regards to ownership of the canal with no side seeming to buckle. This conference was an overall failure as the situation is continuing to escalate."
 suezcrisis.7.d:0 "Today a secret meeting took place in the French town of Sevres, between British, French and Israeli representatives, all countries present are outraged by the Egyptian nationalization of the canal and are in favour of action to undo the nationalization. The plan is for the Israeli forces to attack the Sinai peninsula, stop near the canal, and let the British and French forces attack the canal and overwhelm the Egyptians, ending the conflict."
 suezcrisis.8.d:0 "Today a secret meeting took place in the town of Sevres, between British, French and Israeli representatives, all countries present are outraged by the Egyptian nationalization of the canal and are in favour of action to undo the nationalization. The plan is for the Israeli forces to attack the Sinai peninsula, stop near the canal, and let the British and French forces attack the canal and overwhelm the Egyptians, ending the conflict."
 suezcrisis.9.d:0 "The Anglo-French plan, Operation Musketeer has passed reviews and is waiting to be implemented. The original operation included a British-French landing in Alexandria but the landing site was moved to Port Said to minimize civilian casualties. The objective is to quickly take control of the canal before the Egyptians have time to act."
 suezcrisis.10.d:0 "Today Anglo-French forces landed in Port Said and quickly seized the city after a short battle against the defending Egyptian forces. With pressure already mounting we need to accomplish the goals of the operation or else it will end in failure."
 suezcrisis.11.d:0 "Protests against our invasion have begun to flare up with socialists and non-interventionists alike demanding an end to the operation. The government has largely turned a blind eye in hopes that the protests die down."
 suezcrisis.12.d:0 "Today the final push in the Suez Canal and Operation Musketeer are being executed, a success will put a quick end to the operation and a failure or a stalemate will lead to the failure of the operation with UN pressure forcing our troops to abandon the operation."
 suezcrisis.13.d:0 "Bad news, our push has been bogged down by determined Egyptian defenders. Now we can only wait until a UN ceasefire is decided. The operation has been a failure."
 suezcrisis.14.d:0 "Good news, our push has been successful with Egyptian forces being thrown into a panic and retreating from the canal entirely. Now we have a lot more leverage than we otherwise would have in the oncoming negotiations. Operation Musketeer has been a resounding success."
 suezcrisis.15.d:0 "A UN ceasefire has been decided upon. Our troops will have to leave Egypt today, our relations with the United States has been hurt by this operation and the overall perception of the operation is one of a magnificent failure."
 suezcrisis.16.d:0 "A new treaty has been signed, the Treaty of Alexandria, where Egypt would cede the Suez Canal back to the Suez Canal Company and demilitarize the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. A victory for our foreign policy."
 suezcrisis.17.d:0 "The imperialist Anglos, French and Israelis have withdrawn after their petty attempts at conquering our nation. Our leader is heralded as the saviour of the Arab World. A propaganda victory for our nation."
 suezcrisis.18.d:0 "The imperialist Anglos, French and Israelis have withdrawn but not before imposing an unfair and humiliating treaty on us. This will surely hurt the popularity of our regime."
 suezcrisis.19.d:0 "The Israeli delegation has decided to "abstain" from our plans to seize the Canal, fearing International retaliation. We would have to get another casus belli to intervene, plans are already being drawn up."
 suezcrisis.20.d:0 "Describe how the israelis, although they've won, had to retreat due to political pressure"
 suezcrisis.0:0 "Describe how Egypt finally abrogated the treaty"
 OperationKadesh.1.d_1:0 "Today Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader], Director General of the Ministry of Defense Shimon Peres and Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan have secretly met the French Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief of Staff in addition to the British Foreign Secretary and his assistant in an isolated house in the French town of Sèvres. They talked about the urgency of the situation in Egypt and their reaction to Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal. They then planned a 2 stage invasion of Egypt including a cover story to tell the world. The Israeli delegate feared being abandoned by France and Britain in the middle of the invasion and thus demanded that all sides sign a document pledging their allegiance to each other. All leaders left the building with copies of the agreement, and now all we have to do is to prepare for an invasion of the Sinai peninsula while the Western powers focus on Egypt."

 OperationKadesh.2:0 "With our inclusion in the Anglo-French plan to overthrow Nasser, our objective was to secure the Sinai peninsula while the Anglo-French forces attack the canal itself. Due to limits imposed by the plan to not start the operation with a pre-emptive strike on Egyptian airfields, we have to use paratroopers to secure our objectives instead. The 890th Paratrooper Battalion led by Commander Rafael Eitan were dropped on the eastern approaches of the Mitla Pass and have to hold for several hours until the rest of the Paratroopers can catch up to them."
 OperationKadesh.3:0 "One of our main objectives was to stop Fedayeen incursions into Israel. While many expected Fedayeen bases to be both situated in Gaza and the Sinai peninsula, the IDF has failed to find any Fedayeen bases in the Sinai peninsula and thus has decided to destroy any Fedayeen base it could find in Gaza. After all of this was done, many expect the Fedayeen to be severely weakened and to not pose as a major threat anymore."
 OperationKadesh.4:0 "Our main offensive into the Sinai peninsula has begun in earnest today, with forces moving towards Arish, Abu Ageila and the Mitla Pass. Operation Kadesh can commence now."
 OperationKadesh.5:0 "While the rest of the operation is going swimmingly, the IDF has encountered some difficulties in capturing the important Abu Ageila and Um Katef road junctions. After an unsuccessful frontal assault, armored reinforcements helped the IDF break through the Egyptians lines and virtually take control of the entire nothern Sinai peninsula."
 OperationKadesh.6:0 "Another important place to capture is the strategic Mitla Pass, the same pass the 890th paratroop brigade was dispatched to several days ago. With reinforcements arriving, the paratroopers began to take control of the Mitla Pass, beginning a long and bloody battle against the defending Egyptian army. A mythos is spreading where Private Yehuda Ken-Dror drove a jeep into the Mitla Pass to draw Egyptian fire towards it, sacricifing himself in the process. After the dust settled, 38 Paratroopers were killed, 120 were injured while 260 Egyptians lay dead. At this point the Egyptians are in full retreat to defend the Suez Canal, ending resistance in the northern Sinai."
 OperationKadesh.7:0 "While staying in the Sinai Peninsula, the IDF began destroying Egyptian infrastructure to hinder Egyptian advances in the future. The destruction of infrastructure would prove to be a thorn in the side of the Egyptians for quite some time."
 OperationKadesh.8:0 "The IDF has captured the strategic port of Sharm El Sheikh today, granting the IDF control over South Sinai and incapacitating the Egyptian blockade in the Straits of Tiran and the Straits of Aqaba."
 OperationKadesh.9:0 "International pressure is mounting on us, Britain and France to end the operation and withdraw from the Sinai and the Suez Canal respectively. This culminated with both the US and the USSR issuing stern warnings for us to withdraw from the Sinai. While some opposed the withdrawal, we don't have much of a choice as we don't want to invoke US anger."
 OperationKadesh.10:0 "With the success of the British final push, Egypt was forced into a humiliating peace, granting the Suez Canal back to the Suez Canal Corporation (and effectively Britain), and are forbidden from moving soldiers into the Canal. The treaty also demilitarized the Sinai Peninsula after promising our withdrawal. A demilitarized Sinai Peninsula was greatly supported within Israel and few opposed the withdrawal."
 OperationKadesh.11:0 "Since we opposed joining the Anglo-French plan to take control of the Suez Canal, IDF High Command began concocting plans to end the Fedayeen threat once and for all. The plan named Operation Mapatz started with Paratroopers sneakily dropping into the Gaza Strip, a hotbed of Fedayeen activity, and wreaking havoc into every Fedayeen base they could find, 2 hours in, mechanized groups would assist the paratroopers in their mission which culminated in a great success and a greatly weakened Fedayeen. After the operation, many experts believe that the Fedayeen threat is over for good."

 suez.0.d:0 "With the last of the British troops leaving for their homeland, and their occupation over, our leader Gamel Abdel Nasser has taken a step towards reclaiming our natural territory that has been controlled by the imperialist English for far too long. Today, Nasser has torn up the farcical 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, freeing us from the bonds of the power-hungry West! However, while we are on the verge of winning much glory for ourselves and the whole Arab World, we must wait and see how the international community reacts..."
 suez.1.d:0 "Today, the Egyptian government has decided to unilaterally abrogate the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. This was met with great alarm by many in the international community, as the next logical step for Nasser is nothing less than the seizing of the Suez Canal, which would only devastate our economy and global prestige. Even more ominous, however, is the thought that if Nasser further aligns with the Soviets, as suspected, the Reds will control the flow of oil from the Middle East to the entirety of the Western World."
 suez.2.d:0 "As of a few hours ago, our soldiers have entered the Suez Canal Zone and have rightfully seized it, ousting the Imperialists from it once and for all! Follwing their entry, the government quickly declared the nationalization of the Suez Canal, creating a great moment and greater victory for us and the whole Arab World. The English, as expected, are furious, but they aren't going to be able to get past the UN and the rest of the world unless they decide to do something really crazy."
 suez.3.d:0 "Our fears over the fate of the Suez Canal have been realized, as Egypt has seized and nationalized the Suez Canal. This is an unprecedented danger to our economy and international prestige, and we have to act."
 suez.4.d:0 "Egypt has outrageously nationalized the Suez Canal, putting our trade routes in severe danger. We are not alone in the panic as the British are suffering the brunt of the blow. Between Nasser funding and arming our opposition in Algeria and now this unprecedented, brazen, slap to our face, we must work with the British to ensure Nasser will never harm or insult us again."
 suez.5.d:0 "When Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, they simultaneously blockaded the Straits of Tiran, south of the Red Sea, cutting off the port of Eilat and with it our access to much of our imports- oil or otherwise. This is going to kill our economy and starve our citizens, and we can't let this go quietly. Something has to be done."
 suez.6.d:0 "The US, fearing an escalation of the situation, hosted an international conference in order to solve the crisis. However, all of the parties involved stood their ground in regards to ownership of the canal, with no side seeming willing to buckle or compromise. Despite the high hopes the Americans had for the talks going in, it is clear they have utterly failed, with no agreement or decision being made as to who will get the Canal."
 suez.7.d:0 "Britain chooses whether or not to attack canal. inaction means nothing happens, action means france gets an invite"
 suez.8.d:0 "if france says yes or no, israel gets an invitation, but if france says no they're not included"
