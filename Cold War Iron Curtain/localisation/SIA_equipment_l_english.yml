The M1 Garand is a .30 caliber semi-automatic rifle that saw extensive use during WWII. It is amongst the first weapons to use a gas reloading system to rechamber a new round after firing. It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US.."

 SIA_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

In 1982 the redesign and improvements were made. The weapon featured a strengthened receiver, new rifling, a strengthened case, better cooling as a result of different materials, improved support for attachables, and a redesigned internal mechanism that gave it a high level of reliability. It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."

 SIA_utility_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first member of a series of helicopters known as the 'Huey' (named after its original pre-1962 designation, HU-1), the UH-1A is the military model variant of the Bell 204 utility helicopter, introduced in 1959. It was the first helicopter in service by any branch of the U.S. military to use a turbine-engine. It became one of the most prolific helicopters, a symbol of America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Although informally named 'Huey,' its official nickname is 'Iroquois.'"

 SIA_utility_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Introduced in 1963, the UH-1D is the military model variant of the Bell 205. It was designed with a stretched fuselage, so it could serve primarily as a troop carrier to replace the earlier CH-34 Choctaw in U.S. Army service. 2000 of these 'Iroquois D' variants were built, many of whom were converted to UH-1H standard with an upgraded, and more powerful engine."

 SIA_utility_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "First introduced in 1970, the UH-1N was another member of the extended 'Huey' family, this time being developed from the UH-1H, though unlike the UH-1A and UH-1D, the 'N' variant would be the one to spawn its civilian version, the Bell 212. The main rotor is powered by two turboshaft engines that drive a single output shaft. Should one engine fail the remaining engine can deliver 671 kW (900 shp) for 30 minutes or 571 kW (765 shp) enabling the UH-1N to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight. It was also one of the few 'Iroquois' variants not to be used by the U.S. Army, instead being the standard-bearer for the Marines. Its twin-engine configuration gave it the informal nickname 'Twin Huey.'"

Developed in 1993, the MH-60R was designed to combine the features of the earlier SH-60B and SH-60F. Its sensors include the ASE package, MTS-FLIR, the AN/APS-147 multi-mode radar/IFF interrogator, an advanced airborne fleet data link, and a more advanced airborne active sonar. This, coupled with an improved weapons system (allowing it to carry the advanced Mk 54 torpedo and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles), allow the 'Seahawk' greater flexibility in both anti-shipping and amphibious assault operations."
