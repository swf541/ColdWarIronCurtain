 ZIM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Rifle No. 5 Mk I, was a derivative of the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I, Following experience of jungle fighting in the Pacific War the British came to the conclusion that a rifle shorter and lighter than the standard issue, bolt action .303 cal No. 4 rifle was required. However its operational use was in post-war colonial campaigns such as the Malayan emergency, where it gained its common nickname of the Jungle Carbine."

 ZIM_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The L1A1 is a British version of the Belgian FN FAL battle rifle. It was produced under license and has seen use in numerous Commonwealth nations. The United Kingdom produced its own variant of the FN FAL incorporating the modifications developed by the Allied Rifle Committee, designating it the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR). The weapons were manufactured by the Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield, Birmingham Small Arms, Royal Ordnance Factory and ROF Fazakerley. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by Parker Hale Limited. The SLR served the British Armed Forces from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the L85A1 from 1985 onwards."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
