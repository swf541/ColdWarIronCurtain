The initial 3,000 soldier army of Mauritania was entirely incapable of defending its internal borders from the Polisario Front's constant raids which crippled the country after the rebels took control of the main source of national income: the iron mines of Zouerate. In fact the only thing which held together this desert nation was the involvement of the French Air Force which even then struggled to stop an offensive on the capital city of Nouakchott. With massive unrest in the armed forces with its Arabs and Berbers largely sympathetic with the Saharan rebels and the southern black soldiers seeing it as an intra-Arab conflict out of their interest, the coup by disgruntled, anti-war, military officers was inevitable. Mauritania not only evacuated their entire previously controlled region of West Sahara, but also announced recognition of its independence."
