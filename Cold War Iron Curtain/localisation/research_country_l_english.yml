 USA_aam_short_range_0_desc:0 "Development of Sidewinder began in 1950 at the NOTS later renamed as NWC (Naval Weapons Center) at China Lake. The idea was to create a very simple heat-seeking air-to-air missile by equipping a 12.7 cm air-to-air rocket (based on the 5" zuni) with a lead sulphide photo cell in a hemispherical glass nose to detect IR radiation. Another simple, yet effective, idea was the use of "Rollerons" (sliptream-driven wheels at the fin trailing edges acting as stabilizing gyros) as roll-stabilizing devices. The first test missiles were fired in 1951, and on 11 September 1953, the first air-to-air hit on a drone was scored."

 USA_aam_long_range_0_desc:0 "The AAM-N-6a (AIM-7D) was similar to the -6, but used a new Thiokol liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's F-110A Spectre (F-4 Phantom) fighters in 1962, known to them as the AIM-101. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built."

 USA_aam_short_range_1_desc:0 "The AIM-9E was the first version specifically developed by the USAF. It was an improved AIM-9B with a new seeker with thermoelectric (Peltier) cooling, and a higher tracking rate of 12°/s. The Peltier cooling method allowed unlimited cooling time while the missile was on the launch rail. Externally, the AIM-9E differed from the AIM-9B by its longer conical nose section. About 5000 AIM-9Bs were converted to AIM-9E. The AIM-9E-2 is a variant with a reduced-smoke motor."

It featured a new dual-thrust (boost/sustain) rocket motor (usually a Hercules MK 58, but sometimes an Aerojet MK 65), which greatly increased the missile's range. The AIM-7F also had a completely new solid-state electronic guidance and control system (GCS), designated AN/DSQ-35, which was also compatible with modern pulse-doppler radars."

 USA_aam_short_range_2_desc:0 "In 1971, the USAF and U.S. Navy agreed to jointly develop the AIM-9L, a vastly improved Sidewinder based on the AIM-9H. Major development goals were ALASCA (All-Aspect Capability) and effective use against violently manoeuvering and high-speed targets at all ranges. All AIM-9L features resulted in a vastly improved missile which could acquire targets at all aspects, and had a much improved tracking, manoeuvering, terminal homing, and killing performance. Production started in 1978, and more than 16000 AIM-9Ls have been built."

However, the Soviet Union did not develop their own anti tank infantry weapons and relied heavily on lend leases. The Dyakanov was developed by Dyakanov MG in 1917 and can launch specially built muzzle-loaded explosives such as anti-tank or anti-personnel grenades. The weapon itself saw heavily usage in WWII but was quickly dropped after the end of the war in favor of the Soviet Union developing better infantry grenade launchers and proper MANPATS."

 PRC_manpats_2_short: "RPG-7"
 PRC_manpats_2_desc: "The RPG-7 is a rocket propelled anti-tank grenade developed in 1958 by Bazalt weapons manufacturing company. The RPG-7 is well known for its simplicity, low cost, high effectiveness, and incredible longevity and reliability. It is capable of firing standard, HEAT rounds, fragmentation, and thermobaric rounds. It is comprised of a very simple system lending to its low cost and ease of maintenance. It is based around a steel tube and the middle is cased with wood to protect from heat. The end is flared to aid in blast shielding the user and providing recoil reduction. When fired, it simply strikes the firing pin like a regular firearm to ignite the grenade. It has been ubiquitously since its inception and has been seen in virtually all combat in every place on Earth."

 PRC_manpats_3_short: "RPG-18"
 PRC_manpats_3_desc: "The RPG-19 was developed by Bazalt weapons manufacturing in the early 1970s. The RPG-18 fires a 64 mm HEAT warhead and has an effective range of 200 meters. The warhead always self-destructs after 6 seconds which places a definite limit. The RPG-18 was not used as much as the RPG-7 nor has it made its way around the world as much due to the fact that it cannot be reloaded. It is, however, very cheap despite being more logistically cumbersome as each tube only fires once. It was used extensively in various wars by China as well as the Soviet-Afghan war."
 PRC_manpats_4: "RPG-29"
 PRC_manpats_4_short: "RPG-29"
 PRC_manpats_4_desc: "The RPG-29 is a reloadable anti-tank RPG developed by Bazalt in the late 1980s. It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective. The RPG-29 has been used in the Iraq war, the Syrian civil war, and the 2006 Lebanon war."

KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive.

It saw heavy usage around the end of WWII. It has been licensed to vast numbers of countries resulting it it seeing combat in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Although the weapon itself also has a track record of being involved in many, many civil wars.\nThe M1938 mortar is a 120mm soviet mortar used heavily by the Soviet army during WWII. Its design is a near-copy of the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm. The mortar itself is very easy to limber and unlimber and could move around quickly to avoid counter fire. It uses very heavy 120mm shells and had a high rate of fire, making it a strong weapon for hitting enemy encampments or infantry in heavy cover such as buildings."

 SOV_team_weapons_2_desc: "The KPV is a heavy machine gun designed for the Soviets in 1944 by Semen Vladimirov. It was not brought into production or service until 1949. The gun itself was eventually taken out of infantry service in the mid 1960s for its immense weight and replaced with an alternate HMG. It is notorious for its exceptional 3000 meter horizontal range and 2000 aerial range. Its heavy caliber could also make it useful a light-anti armor weapon and was placed on scout cars and BTRs. It saw usage during the Korean and Vietnam war and its hand down leasing has led these weapons to see combat in many different wars. Even today, the gun itself has not yet been taken out of service and has seen modern conflicts such as the Gulf and Iraq wars.\nThe 120-PM-43 mortar was a 120mm muzzle loaded breech Soviet mortar developed in 1943 and was a modified version of the M1938. Its design was heavily simplified and its weight and costs were vastly reduced. It was used in the end of WWII and saw soviet usage in the Afghanistan wars as well as Vietnam and the Gulf war."

The weapon has extensive changes over the former NSVT including a rotating bolt replacing the pivoting breech lock, an improved gas system, and reworked muzzle baffle. The gun has much less recoil giving it higher accuracy and longer sustained fire times, making it better for suppressing fire and long range fire support. It is also vastly lighter and produces a higher volume of fire. It has seen combat in a large variety of modern Russian and Russian-sphere conflicts including the Russo-Georgian war and the Syrian Civil war. There are also reports that it has been seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with the US albeit rarely.\nThe ASG-30 is a heavy grenade launcher developed in 1990 by the KBP bureau for the Soviet Union but was not adopted until after the dissolution in 1995 by the Russian federation. It fires at a rate of 400 rounds per minute and is equipped with a blowback action. Its design is based heavily off of the AGS-17 and is massively lighter, more mobile, has a longer range, and is more accurate. The launcher has gained notable prestige in its capability to take down fortified enemies. Its capability was proven in the second Chechen war where it proved to be a highly capable weapon."

It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective. The RPG-29 has been used in the Iraq war, the Syrian civil war, and the 2006 Lebanon war."

 SOV_manpads_2_short: "Strela-3"
 SOV_manpads_2_desc: "The Soviet Union quickly began developing the Strela-3 after it was noted that the Strela-2 had performed ineffectively in combat. KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive. The Strela-3 was used in many different middle eastern conflicts such as the Iraq-Iran war, but didn't see much combat within' the Soviet sphere itself."

 IND_support_equipment_desc:0 "A large assortment of high-quality equipment purchased from the civilian market. Medical equipment and supplies, logistics equipment, binoculars, construction equipment and tools, and various other assorted publicly available items. It's not difficult to find, order, or contract a vast majority of the support equipment used."
 IND_support_equipment_0_desc:0 "A large assortment of high-quality equipment purchased from the civilian market. Medical equipment and supplies, logistics equipment, binoculars, construction equipment and tools, and various other assorted publicly available items. It's not difficult to find, order, or contract a vast majority of the support equipment used."
 IND_motorized_equipment_1_desc:0 "A sturdy and reliable 1.5 ton 4x4 farm truck. While not as good as proper military-grade trucks, large bed farm trucks often suit their purpose just fine. Farm trucks are built with reliability in mind and capable of hauling large loads of cargo in various terrains. Farm trucks can haul fair amounts of cargo and carry up to 10 soldiers in the back. Although reliable and somewhat strong they often have trouble carrying notably heavy loads and may require conversions or trailers to suit their purpose. As such these farm trucks come with custom ordered equipment or specifications."
 IND_motorized_equipment_4_desc:0 "An exceptionally strong 6x6 5-ton heavy-duty offroad truck built for industrial purposes with custom modifications and built to order off the civilian market. Capable of carrying up to 12 soldiers and hauling just as much weight as military utility trucks, the 6x6 civilian market industrial trucks perfectly suit the military's needs. These trucks often share most of the same elements as military-grade vehicles and sometimes are the same designs."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:0 "A simple but elegant early market helicopter. Helicopters have numerous uses in industry, public services, emergency services, commerce, and sometimes personal usage. Civilian market helicopters rarely live up to the specifications of military-grade helicopters and will not be anywhere near as capable."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "A commercial helicopter purchased on the civilian market. These helicopters are intended for a variety of civilian purposes including emergency or public services and commerce. These helicopters can be fitted for a variety of military roles by custom order or by retrofitting by military professionals."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_5_desc:0 "An exceptionally strong and capable heavy-duty helicopter built for emergency services and industrial use. These helicopters are fast, strong, and somewhat comparable to military-grade helicopters in the era they are available for purchase. They can be fitted to serve virtually any role a military utility helicopter can and serve a direct combat or support role. Additionally, with minor custom specifications they can even be equipped with countermeasures or weapons you produce or purchase from military contracts."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_3_desc:0 "A mixture of numerous different surplus transport planes left over from WW2 and sold by a large variety of independent surplus traders. Many nations after WW2 had surplus equipment they no longer desired to kept or wanted to replace with more modern planes after the war. As such, these surplus WW2 transport planes come in varying states of repair, mileage, and design. But you can't put a price on antiquity."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_5_desc:0 "After the creation of efficient air freight in 1950s, commercial and industrial uses for cargo planes skyrocketed. These commercial cargo planes are more than capable of efficiently transporting cargo or serving military purposes. Commercial cargo planes need minimal refitting for military purposes unless they are used for airborne operations in which case their design would need to be altered heavily to fit that role. However, they often have no trouble in most situations."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_8_desc:0 "Comprising numerous different categories of cargo jets, these commercial cargo jets can be anything from combi planes to belly cargo planes or even comprise international postal service cargo planes. These cargo jets are often used to transport cargo that needs to be delivered quickly and cannot arrive on a freighter's time. These jets are often capable of serving military roles but it is heavily recommended that you custom order them for airborne operations in combat zones."
 IND_cargo_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "A prototype/early-adoption civilian market cargo helicopter. While the civilian world had countless uses for utility helicopters, making heavy-duty cargo helicopters for commercial or military purposes took some time. There were plenty of early adopters for cargo helicopters and large numbers of independent manufacturers that could take cargo helicopter contracts and orders."
 IND_cargo_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "A fully capable industrial/commercial civilian market cargo helicopter. These helicopters are capable of filling numerous roles in industry or commerce and are used extensively in emergency services. Besides emergency services and some divisions in industry and commerce, they are often a luxury or novelty as smaller utility helicopters fill the same roles just as fine for civilian needs. However, it isn't hard to find civilian industrial manufacturers that are able to and willing to produce these."

Civilian merchant vessels can serve in military logistics perfectly and are ubiquitously available with countless manufacturers and drydocks readily available to mass manufacture these ships. Cargo freighters handle the bulk of international trade in the world and are divided into classes based on the type of cargo they carry. They can be general cargo vessels, container ships, tankers, dry bulk carriers, multi-purpose vessels, RORO ships (for wheeled vehicles), or reefer ships (refrigerated)."
