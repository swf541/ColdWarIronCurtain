Four pre-production technology demonstrators were constructed. The first flight took place in September of 1963 and, in early 1966 the aircraft completed its first full flight from vertical takeoff to vertical landing. The aircraft was showcased to the public on the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution. After promising results were obtained in the Yak-36 program, the next stage of development, the Yak-38 was greenlit. Known by its NATO reporting name Freehand."

 SOV_jump_jet_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Yak-38 was developed from the Yak-36 (and was originally designated Yak-36M as a result), although the two aircraft had little in common. It was the Soviet Naval Aviation’s only operational VTOL fighter aircraft and their first fixed-wing, carrier-based aircraft. The Yak-38 served almost exclusively on the Kiev-class Aircraft Carrier, entering service in 1976. The aircraft saw no active combat use but once intercepted American aircraft from the U.S.S Enterprise over the Arabian Sea. Its NATO codename is Forger-A"

The Yak-38M entered service with the Soviet Naval Aviation. Despite the upgrades to the design, the Forger still was underpowered and proved disappointing in the end. The type would be retired upon collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991."

The aircraft was intended to act as a comprehensive replacement for the Yak-38 Forger, and was capable of sustained supersonic flight and parity with Soviet land-based fighters. The aircraft made its first flight in early 1987, with the first hovering flight in 1989. In 1991 the first naval vertical naval landing was completed successfully. Despite showing promise, the Freestyle program was cancelled in August of 1991 due to a lack of funding."

Like the Yak-141, the Yak-43 would have had only a single main engine, as well as two dedicated vertical-lift engines. Unfortunately, like the Yak-141, it too never reached production, also due in part to the Soviet Union's collapse."

The F-35 program began development in 1992, with the A variant taking to the skies in late 2006 and dropping its first bombs less than six years later. The A variant is the smallest and lightest variant of F-35 and is primarily intended to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Republic of Korea was one of many allied nations to purchase F-35s."

However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war.

In addition, a full radio navigation suite was installed. Not surprisingly, combat performance with a full fuel load suffered.

It was also used for so-called "morale raids" designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities. Its primary mission, however, was to attack German airfields, rail yards and other rear-area facilities at night. Because these aircraft were morale boosters, the German Luftwaffe often targeted these, with a large number being destroyed over the course of the Great Patriotic War.

The MiG-15 was involved in many conflicts since its introduction in the Korean War, where it proved a worthy adversary to the American F-86 Sabre and F9F Panther. A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations. While most aircraft were decommissioned in the 1950’s, some still remain in service with the North Korean Air Force."

Unable to acquire new aircraft or spare parts for its existing fleet, the RV i PVO turned to its domestic aviation industry in order to create an indigenous design to fulfill the need for additional aircraft.

The Avion featured a cropped delta-canard configuration and was to be capable of achieving supersonic speeds under a combat configuration. Upon its entry to service with the SFR Yugoslav Air Force, which was anticipated to occur during the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Avion would have been used as a replacement for the nation's aging fleet of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s. The nation also anticipated considerable exports sales of the type. During 1991, the entire programme was halted due to a lack of available finance just prior to the commencement of production and a year prior to the scheduled date of the type's envisioned maiden flight. The Avion was terminated as a consequence of the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars and the subsequent break-up of the country."
