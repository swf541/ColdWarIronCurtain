 heavy_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Heavy Fighter I"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Heavy Fighter I"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Our bomber force needs escort protection from enemy fighters all the way to their targets and back. In order to provide this escort, we must design fighter aircraft with bomber range. Out of necessity these aircraft are larger, slower and less agile than light fighters, though they can carry significant armament."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Heavy Fighter II"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Heavy Fighter II"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The war has taught us that our heavy fighter design is vulnerable to more nimble fighters, but quite good at the interception of enemy bombers due to heavy armament. This next design will focus on increased attack capability against enemy aircraft and even ground targets. Its speed and range will be improved as well."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Heavy Fighter III"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "Heavy Fighter III"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Though our heavy fighter force has shown adeptness in various roles, we must consider a new design that will enhance its ability relative to enemy fighters, as well as allow it to continue intercepting increasingly faster and better defended enemy bombers."
 strat_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Strategic Bomber I"
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Strat Bomber I"
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experiences from the Great War and studies since show that bombing the enemy's military targets and major cities will win the next war. At the very least, we must have a bomber capable of delivering such destruction. It will need to fly high and at good speed, and it must carry a large payload. This will require a large airframe with multiple engines. It will also have some defensive capability."
 strat_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Strategic Bomber II"
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Strat Bomber II"
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Bombing has proven effective at reducing the enemy's capacity to wage war. More defensive weaponry and increased speed will allow a new design to avoid destruction, while increasing the payload and range will make it more effective."

 tac_bomber_equipment_0:0 "Interwar Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "It is widely believed that the next war will be won entirely by bombing the enemy to extinction. It is imperative that we begin designing our own bomber plane that is capable of carrying heavy payloads at adequate speed."
 tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Tactical Bomber I"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Tac Bomber I"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Medium bombers need to be versatile and fast, capable of fulfilling a range of roles. A twin-engine design, remaining relatively light, can continue to be of use for many years to come."
 tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Tactical Bomber II"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Tac Bomber II"

 aerosub_0:0 "Prototype Flying Submarine"
 aerosub_0_short:0 "AEROSUB I"
 aerosub_0_desc:0 "The flying submarine is an amphibious naval bomber plane capable of submerging itself to evade enemy anti-air fire and improve stealth. Using either air or sea cover, the flying submarine is more defensible at a substantial cost and tradeoff to performance.\nOriginally thought of by unnamed British high command officers and reported in the British trade journal 'flying', the flying submarine, or 'aerosub' was rarely ever taken seriously. In the late 30s to mid 50s, the Soviet Union took serious steps to try and create an aerosub but the project failed miserably. It would not be explored again until the early 60s where Donald Reid would design an amphibious submersible single seat aircraft that was far simpler in concept to the aerosub pursued by the Soviet Union. However, in 2008, the US DARPA agency announced it would begin to reexplore the aerosub concept."

But the 'Superfortress's' claim to fame was the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which contributed to the end of the war.

It also comes equipped with a Magnetic Anomaly Detector on its tail to detect submarines using the Earth's magnetic field.

Initial production aircraft had a camera nose located on the lower part of the radome. Later production aircraft had retractable an IRDS turret in lieu of the nose camera. Beginning in the early 1980s existing camera noses were retrofitted with IRDS turrets. Early models were also known as P-3C "Baseline" or Non-Update (NUD) aircraft.

Despite the U.S. refusal to Lend-Lease the B-29, four B-29s crash landed in Soviet territory, and that was enough to begin the reverse-engineering process. Despite many difficulties (procuring parts that were equivalent or superior to American-developed parts, conversion from imperial to metric system, etc.) the Tu-4's first flight and entry into service was enough to panic the U.S. and Great Britain, the first of many during the Cold War. It would have a brief service life however, replaced by jet bombers by the mid-1960s. Its NATO reporting name is Bull."

Upon its entry to service with the SFR Yugoslav Air Force, which was anticipated to occur during the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Avion would have been used as a replacement for the nation's aging fleet of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s. The nation also anticipated considerable exports sales of the type. During 1991, the entire program was halted due to a lack of available finance just prior to the commencement of production and a year prior to the scheduled date of the type's envisioned maiden flight. The Avion was terminated as a consequence of the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars and the subsequent break-up of the country."
