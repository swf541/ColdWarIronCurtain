During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopia during World War II, Haile Selassie made Ethiopia an active member of the League of Nations while later leading a government in exile in London. Seen as a modernizer by his supporters, Haile Selassie believes Ethiopia needs to open itself to the outside world. Upon coming to power Selassie organized Ethiopia's entry into the League of nations and in 1945 Ethiopia was a founding member of the United Nations. While most of Ethiopia is illiterate and has little opinion of the affairs of its nation, among the intelligencia and student youth there is in contrast a wide array of criticisms towards the Emperor. These critics, view Haile Selassie as an autocrat who has failed to end the immense and devestating poverty brought by the archaic feudalistic system which controls most of the nation's people."

At the age of eight Nguema saw his father (a local witch doctor) be beaten to death by a Spanish colonial administratior for requesting better plantation working conditions. Hardly heard of in the wider Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist community, Nguema is known to wallow in obscurity and isolation. Hoarding his nation's treasury in his personal estate with a large fleet of sports cars, Nguema is unlikely to attract foreign appreciation. Personal interests of Nguema are the usage of psycoactive, hallucinogenic native plants and collecting the head's of his enemies in an alphabetically organized compartment of a warehouse. With blocking off the roads to exit Equatorial Guinea and ordering the execution of all who violate arbitrary, nonsensical laws, Francisco Macías Nguema may set himself to be the greatest leader of the twentieth century."

His familiarity with the United States enabled him to secure their support in his campaign to become President and many conservative Korean nationalists joined his cause.

By 1960 he joined the National Democratic Party (NDP) to push the British into giving Rhodesia majority rule. After NDP party leader Joshua Nkomo failed and agreed to accept white minority rule, Mugabe, along with many other members were irate. By the end of 1961 the NDP was banned and Mugabe joined the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) as General Secretary. The election of the hardline Rhodesian Front saw racial unrest spike as African nationalists grew disenchanted with the prospect of Britain intervening or of white Rhodesians agreeing to provide equal constitutional rights to Africans. By 1963 Mugabe along with leading ZAPU leaders were imprisoned for speeches they made. After the unilateral declaration of independence by the Rhodesian Front in 1965, Mugabe and his allies encouraged armed resistance against the regime as the only way to achieve majority rule. Unlike other ZAPU leaders who either were bribed or intimidated by the Rhodesian government, Mugabe always maintained his stance regarding majority rule. By 1969 he became President of ZAPU in recognition for his devotion and leadership."

Before entering politics, Nkrumah came to significance in the Colony of the Gold Coast as an organizer of labor unions; a response to unnecessary colonial oppression following post-war inflation. Becoming prominent in the Gold Coast's colonial assemmbly during the 40s, he was pressured to form his own political party, the Convention People's Party in 1949.

Radicalized by Radio Cairo and his interactions with fellow students in his adolescent education, al-Qaddafi organized a revolutionary military clique of young officers in Benghazi. Now the de facto leader of Libya, Colonel Qaddafi is finding himself at odds with the revolutionary command council he helped establish. Either he is to assert his control and continue his plans to modernize Libya or outside forces loyal to the previous Senussi regime will end this 'revolution' he so estatically founded."

Taking the role as chief of the Order during the Italian invasion of Libya in 1913, Idris was initially a bold and steadfast leader as he fought against the Italians and other neighboring pseudo-states while securing an alliance with Britain. Under the Kingdom of Italy, Idris lead a de facto independent state in Cyrenaica until pressure under Fascist Italy convinced him to exile himself in Egypt. Following the Second World War Idris is recognized as the Emir of Cyrenaica with various allied powers trying to back him as a King of a United Libya while others wish to partition all of the region under British, Italian, and French control. Regardless of what happens, its clear Idris favors the people of Cyrenaica and the Senussi elite over any other group in Libyan society."

In 1946 Sokolovsky took command of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, helping oversee the development of the indigenous Socialist Unity Party of Germany as the principal communist party in Soviet controlled Germany. In 1948 Sokolovsky walked out of the Allied Control Council, effectively ending interallied cooperation on the German occupation. This has heightened tensions in Europe between the Soviet Union and its former wartime allies in the West. Sokolovsky remains resistant to any perceived allied interference and oversees the continued development of local communism in his territory."

 POLITICS_TITO_DESC:0 "The son of a large peasant family, Josip Broz Tito grew up with much hardship and poverty. He spent his early years working in different factories across the Austo-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, the Russians captured him but during the Russian Revolution he left his prison camp and actively participated in the revolution. His experience prepared Tito when he returned home to agitate for communist unrest against the Yugoslavian monarchy. Despite facing arrest and unemployment, Tito emerged as a leading party member, surviving Yugoslavian and Soviet purges. Tito rose to global prominence during World War II as he led the Yugoslavian partisans to eventual victory against the German occupation forces. He received recognition from the Allies and used his position as the recognized Prime Minister to re-constitute Yugoslavia under his complete control in 1945. He abolished the monarchy and purged non-communists. The post-war saw tensions rise between Tito and Stalin over the direction of the communist world. By 1948 the two leaders were split, and Tito has started a new series of purges against Stalinists to shore up his control over the country as power increasingly lies in his hands or with his closest supporters."

Prince Abd al-llah continues the difficult task of maintaining Hashemite rule over a deeply divided kingdom where the currents of different ideologies, ethnicities, and languages are increasingly clashing."
 POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "In 1936 King Farouk I inherited the throne after his father died in 1936. The sixteen year had grown up in opulent luxury and almost complete isolation in the royal palace. His early reign began with much hope as he toured his country and promised to bring relief to Egypt’s poverty-stricken population. His lack of political will combined with the Wafd and British actively hindering him caused Farouk to lose interest in governing. What initial goodwill he achieved largely dissipated during World War II as the massive allied military presence led to skyrocketing inflation that left many Egyptians in a dire state. His efforts during the war to leverage Egyptian cooperation for full independence led to the British military surrounding the palace to force him to capitulate to British demands. After the war he failed to negotiate a resolution on who would govern Sudan, he failed to secure a complete British withdrawal, and he led Egypt to military defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His decadent lifestyle of late-night gambling and womanizing combined with his recent failures have shook the peoples trust in his leadership. Although known for his charm and streaks of intelligence, so far the King has been unable or unwilling to make the changes Egyptians are increasingly clamoring for."

After securing Samos’s union to Greece after the First Balkan War, he joined the Greek parliament and served as a minister to the Thessaloniki government that opposed King Constantine I. In 1924 he became head of the centrist Liberal Party and Prime Minister for the first of three times. During the turbulent interwar years Sofoulis was a source of moderation and compromise, able to establish relationships across the political spectrum. During World War II he was briefly detained by the Germans during their occupation of Greece but he refused to back the National Liberation Front due to its connection to communism. After World War II Sofouils offered proposals to avoid civil war, though these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1947 he returned to the Prime Minister post for a third time and currently leads the Greek government against the Democratic Army of Greece."
 POLITICS_NASSER_DESC:0 "Growing up, Gamal Abdel Nasser moved constantly due to his father’s job as a postal worker. This exposure to the many facets of Egyptian life and the vast disparity in wealth across society had a profound impact on him. Early on Nasser read Egyptian nationalist poems, books, and participated in anti-government protests, fully embracing Egyptian nationalism. Despite his known police record as an agitator he joined the Royal Military Academy with aspirations of following the footsteps of history’s great revolutionaries. While training, he connected with likeminded nationalist officers and created a close network through his ability to charm and connect with people. This network evolved into the underground anti-monarchy Association of Free Officers in 1949. Two events pushed Nasser and his fellow nationalist officers down a revolutionary path. One was the British intimidation of King Farouk I in 1942, this event demonstrated to Nasser the monarchy’s impotence in the face of colonialism. Second, the utter military failure of Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Nasser and his officers felt Egypt’s fighting men fought bravely but were let down by faulty equipment, royal indifference, and poor preparation from the King. After these events, Nasser worked to ensure the Association of Free Officers were prepared to move against the government when the time came.  The successful revolution would end the nearly two century long Muhammad Ali Dynasty in Egypt and break the dominance of society by the elite. Nasser quickly stood out among the Free Officers for his ability to talk to the average Egyptian, his natural charisma, and passionate belief securing a bright future for the people of Egypt."

Becoming politically active in the 1920s, Kenyatta travelled accross British East Africa on a motorbike converting to Christianity and  developing a staunch anti-colonialist viewpoint as he witnessed the suffering and inefficency colonialism brought on the region. After living in Britian and making friends with more radical elements of the British Labour party, Kenyatta travelled to Moscow with George Padmore where he was increasingly radicalized by anti-imperialist sentiment. After being a writer for the British Communist Party, Kenyatta and Padmore left the Soviet Union in protest after the abolishment of the 'International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'. However, Kenyatta became increasingly moderate and more politically conservative after his education in economics and phenotics while still keeping to his Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist roots. Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in the 1940s where he would establish himself as the undisputed leader of the Kenyan African Union. Being imprisoned during the Mau Mau uprising for his political activities, Kenyatta openly denounced any form of civil disobedience or illegal action against the colonial regime. Now that he is free from his wrongful imprisonment, Jomo Kenyatta is determined to lead Kenya to a future of economic and social prosperity."

Soon after, he began implementing the Corrective Movement to undo the ruinous changes by his predecessor and building a sustainable Socialist model for Syria. His Presidency notably brought the Alawites; Shiite offshoots native to the Levant into the political stage. As expect with how his rise was compared to a 'Jew becoming a Tsar' or an 'Untouchable becoming a Maharajah', the Sunni majority sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood began to resent him and Ba'athist secularism. Disloyalty close to home from his ambitious brothers require him to keep high attention to secure his Presidency. His own ambition, since in power is to make Syria key player in the Arab World and the Middle-East."
 POLITICS_BASHAR_AL_ASSAD_DESC:0 "Doctor Bashar al-Assad's ascention to Presidency was the least anticipated to the outside world. In reality after the death of his elder brother Bassel, Hafez immediately turned his attention of succession to his second son. For the following six years, preparation of succession was made starting with return from London and abruptly ending his ophthalmology post-graduate studies. He was familiarised with the military apparatus, then given authority over Syrian involvement in Lebanon. In addition, he was made the face of the anti-corruption drive in the government and took head of the Syrian Computer Society. The world looks in wonder in how the son of Hafez will lead the Syrian state."
