Walter attended primary school for eight years of his official education, later transferring education to study joining & artisanship. Both of Ulbricht’s parents were members of the SPD(Social Democratic Party) which Walter would eventually register for in 1912. An impressionable teenage Ulbricht had radicalized his views to the point where he joined the Communist Party of Germany after deserting the army twice during the great war. Post-war, Ulbricht was elected to the party’s central committee. Seeing to bolshevize the communist party as well as reorganizing it into an operational cell structure. Walter would become an instrumental member of the party, eventually being elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the Communist Party. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Ulbricht fled the country to live abroad working as a KPD operative, rigorously persecuting Troksyites and other deviants. Ulbricht returned to eastern occupied Germany in 1945 to assist in the reconstruction of the KPD and eventual merger with the SPD to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party). By 1949 with the establishment of the DDR, Walter was appointed deputy prime minister of the state and created the General Secretary position in the administration. By Pieck’s death in 1960, Walter swiftly consolidated power and eliminated all opponents of his, ensuring de-Stalinization would not occur in the DDR. Until the unveiling of the Berlin wall, Ulbricht’s authority over the economy saw little liberalization with massive surveillance over the people of East Germany. Eight years after the death of Stalin, Ulbricht seemingly remains the last man in the bloc who continues to embrace Stalinzation. The question remains, what will the union’s new leadership think of this."

 RAKOSI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party§!\nBrought up into a Serbian Jewish family of four, Mátyás Rákosi grew up in Ada, Serbia(then Austria-Hungary). Living quite a modest life alongside his four siblings and parents, Mátyás’s family moved to Hungary. In his early 20s, Rákosi embraced social democracy, later becoming a communist supporter. Rákosi believed that atheism was a core value of the communist cause, eventually denouncing his personal Jewish faith. Serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the great war, Rákosi was captured as a prisoner of war in the Russian Army. In 1918, Rákosi returned to Hungary as a staunch communist undertaking commissar duties in the short-lived Hungarian Communist Bela Kun regime. Mátyás was forced to flee to Moscow due to the counter-revolution in Hungary, and in 1924 dispatched back to Hungary to reorganize the Communist party in the country. Followed by multiple arrests by Hungarian authorities and an eventual life-sentence in 1934. While serving as the Hungarian Communist party chief in exile, Rakosi would return to the homeland in 1944 followed by Soviet troops. Ultimately becoming secreatry of the Hungarian communist party, Rákosi has been exposed as a staunch Stalinist.

He oversaw the rebirth of the French Republic after the war but resigned in 1946 over political disagreements.

 POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "In 1936 King Farouk I inherited the throne after his father died in 1936. The sixteen year had grown up in opulent luxury and almost complete isolation in the royal palace. His early reign began with much hope as he toured his country and promised to bring relief to Egypt’s poverty-stricken population. His lack of political will combined with the Wafd and British actively hindering him caused Farouk to lose interest in governing. What initial goodwill he achieved largely dissipated during World War II as the massive allied military presence led to skyrocketing inflation that left many Egyptians in a dire state. His efforts during the war to leverage Egyptian cooperation for full independence led to the British military surrounding the palace to force him to capitulate to British demands. After the war he failed to negotiate a resolution on who would govern Sudan, he failed to secure a complete British withdrawal, and he led Egypt to military defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His decadent lifestyle of late-night gambling and womanizing combined with his recent failures have shook the peoples trust in his leadership. Although known for his charm and streaks of intelligence, so far the King has been unable or unwilling to make the changes Egyptians are increasingly clamoring for."
 POLITICS_SOFOULIS_DESC:0 "Originally a trained archaeologist, Sofouils, quit and joined the parliament of his native Samos. After securing Samos’s union to Greece after the First Balkan War, he joined the Greek parliament and served as a minister to the Thessaloniki government that opposed King Constantine I. In 1924 he became head of the centrist Liberal Party and Prime Minister for the first of three times. During the turbulent interwar years Sofoulis was a source of moderation and compromise, able to establish relationships across the political spectrum. During World War II he was briefly detained by the Germans during their occupation of Greece but he refused to back the National Liberation Front due to its connection to communism. After World War II Sofouils offered proposals to avoid civil war, though these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1947 he returned to the Prime Minister post for a third time and currently leads the Greek government against the Democratic Army of Greece."
 POLITICS_NASSER_DESC:0 "Growing up, Gamal Abdel Nasser moved constantly due to his father’s job as a postal worker. This exposure to the many facets of Egyptian life and the vast disparity in wealth across society had a profound impact on him. Early on Nasser read Egyptian nationalist poems, books, and participated in anti-government protests, fully embracing Egyptian nationalism. Despite his known police record as an agitator he joined the Royal Military Academy with aspirations of following the footsteps of history’s great revolutionaries. While training, he connected with likeminded nationalist officers and created a close network through his ability to charm and connect with people. This network evolved into the underground anti-monarchy Association of Free Officers in 1949. Two events pushed Nasser and his fellow nationalist officers down a revolutionary path. One was the British intimidation of King Farouk I in 1942, this event demonstrated to Nasser the monarchy’s impotence in the face of colonialism. Second, the utter military failure of Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Nasser and his officers felt Egypt’s fighting men fought bravely but were let down by faulty equipment, royal indifference, and poor preparation from the King. After these events, Nasser worked to ensure the Association of Free Officers were prepared to move against the government when the time came.  The successful revolution would end the nearly two century long Muhammad Ali Dynasty in Egypt and break the dominance of society by the elite. Nasser quickly stood out among the Free Officers for his ability to talk to the average Egyptian, his natural charisma, and passionate belief securing a bright future for the people of Egypt."
 POLITICS_KENYATTA_DESC:0 "An ethnic Kikuyu, Jomo Kenyatta was born in a small homestead in central Kikuyuland in most likely the 1890s. Becoming politically active in the 1920s, Kenyatta travelled accross British East Africa on a motorbike converting to Christianity and  developing a staunch anti-colonialist viewpoint as he witnessed the suffering and inefficency colonialism brought on the region. After living in Britian and making friends with more radical elements of the British Labour party, Kenyatta travelled to Moscow with George Padmore where he was increasingly radicalized by anti-imperialist sentiment. After being a writer for the British Communist Party, Kenyatta and Padmore left the Soviet Union in protest after the abolishment of the 'International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'. However, Kenyatta became increasingly moderate and more politically conservative after his education in economics and phenotics while still keeping to his Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist roots. Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in the 1940s where he would establish himself as the undisputed leader of the Kenyan African Union. Being imprisoned during the Mau Mau uprising for his political activities, Kenyatta openly denounced any form of civil disobedience or illegal action against the colonial regime. Now that he is free from his wrongful imprisonment, Jomo Kenyatta is determined to lead Kenya to a future of economic and social prosperity."

 POLITICS_SHUKRI_AL_QUWATLI_DESC:0 "President Shukri al-Quwatli is beloved by his countrymen for bringing long-waited independence from the French Mandate. Knowing how the French have attempted to curb the Syrian path to independence, he remains wary of the West and sees to it that Syrian independence is secured."
 POLITICS_HUSNI_AL_ZAIM_DESC:0 "General Husni al-Zaim seized power in a military coup from the democratically elected, but anti-Western President Shukri al-Quwatli. Soon after taking charge, he agreed to Western interests in the country and began negotiating a ceasefire with Israel. Although he presents himself as the force for modernisation and Western values, the list of enemies grows faster than the reach of Uncle Sam's light."
 POLITICS_ADIB_SHISHAKLI_DESC:0 "General Adib Shishakli and allies in the SSNP deposed al-Zaim in retaliation of the latter's betrayal of the SSNP by handing Antoun Saadeh to Lebanon for execution. After executing the traitorous and corrupt General, Shishakli has diplomatically kept Syria's alignment to the West but presented himself uncompromising to Zionism. It doesn't seem he kept the lessons from his predecessor to heart however, as enemies surround the seat of the Presidency."

Following the Saudis conquest of the Hejaz in 1925, Prince Abd al-llah went with his father to join Faisal I in Iraq.

However, following a pro-Axis coup in 1941 he had to flee Iraq with Faisal II. The British quickly defeated the coup and restored the Hashemites. Syrians sympathetic to the monarchy eventually offered him the crown of the Arab Kingdom of Syria, a position he readily accepted. The restoration of the monarchy was celebrated, but some Syrians resent rulership by a foreign monarch loyal to the Western world."
 POLITICS_HAFEZ_AL_ASSAD_DESC:0 "In the Corrective Movement General Hafez al-Assad seized the Presidency of Syria, purging Leftist radicals in the Ba'ath Party. Soon after, he began implementing the Corrective Movement to undo the ruinous changes by his predecessor and building a sustainable Socialist model for Syria. His Presidency notably brought the Alawites; Shiite offshoots native to the Levant into the political stage. As expect with how his rise was compared to a 'Jew becoming a Tsar' or an 'Untouchable becoming a Maharajah', the Sunni majority sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood began to resent him and Ba'athist secularism. Disloyalty close to home from his ambitious brothers require him to keep high attention to secure his Presidency. His own ambition, since in power is to make Syria key player in the Arab World and the Middle-East."
 POLITICS_BASHAR_AL_ASSAD_DESC:0 "Doctor Bashar al-Assad's ascention to Presidency was the least anticipated to the outside world. In reality after the death of his elder brother Bassel, Hafez immediately turned his attention of succession to his second son. For the following six years, preparation of succession was made starting with return from London and abruptly ending his ophthalmology post-graduate studies. He was familiarised with the military apparatus, then given authority over Syrian involvement in Lebanon. In addition, he was made the face of the anti-corruption drive in the government and took head of the Syrian Computer Society. The world looks in wonder in how the son of Hafez will lead the Syrian state."

Now a leader of a city-state dwarfed in every way by her neighbours, he knows Singapore has a tough road ahead. This will not stop Lee however, as he will do everything to transform the country from Third-world to First-world."

 POLITICS_JDMOBUTU_DESC:0 "Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, or more casually Joe Mobutu, is an aspiring young military leader who had risen through the ranks of the colonial Force Publique. Mobutu can be charismatic and jovial in some setting but entirely homicidal and psycopathic in others, he is entirely unpredictable which made him very useful as an unempathetic, self-concerned, indeginous collaborator in the colonial force publique under Belgium. In an independent Congo, free of his old masters, this young officer might be showing himself to being too ambitious as he now can find himself manipulating even more poweriful external elements like the CIA or World Bank..."
 POLITICS_MOBUTU_SESE_SEKO_DESC:0 "After consolidating his power, Mobutu Sese Seko has established himself as the soul undisputed dictator of Congo-Kinshasa or as it is known now - Zaire. Living in luxury in the rentier-state of the Congo, Mobutu spends his pastimes relaxing on his private yacht cruising up the Congo River with European royalty and American businessmen. In his program of "Authenticité"(To authenticate Congolese nationalism), Mobutu has attempted to culturally Africanize the people and state of Zaire through strict legal force. Banning Christian names, forcing the populous to adopt new state-mandated ones, and banning all usage of western clothing are showing quick results. These Africanization iniatives have bolsterd his supporters in the Popular Movement of the Revolution. Conversly, foreign observers and large amounts of Congolese expats are very critical of Mobutu in response to his widespread openly presented human rights violations."
 POLITICS_LAMUMBA_DESC:0 "Born to a small farmstead in kasai, Patrice Lamumba only wants two things - For the Belgians to leave the congo and for liberty with dignity to come to his people. Like many Congolese, Patrice Lamumba is accustom to using three or four languages on a daily basis and as a scholor of the French language, Lamumba took interest in the literature of the prominent French thinkers of the enlightenment. Being a traveling beer salesmen who wrote part time poetry however, was not satisfying enough for Lamumba and in 1958 he founded his political party of the Mouvement National Congolais. Lamumba had shown himself to represent his party well in the pan-africanist All-African People's Conference in Accras where he impressed Kwame Nkrumah with his intelligence and precise plans for independence of his nation. Like Nkrumah, Lamumba based his party on a Pan-Africanist belief and wanted to create a new Congolese identity devoid of ethnic favoritism. Speaking for his party at the Belgian roundtables, Lamumba won the national election held a month before independence. Now being in power Lamumba has found himself in a political power struggle between the President of the country, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The power of the Prime Minister and the President are poorly defined in the constitution and the disagreements between the conservative federalist Kasa-Vubu with the leftist centralist Lamumba may lead the government into paralysis."
