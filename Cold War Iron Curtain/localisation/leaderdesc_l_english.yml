Walter attended primary school for eight years of his official education, later transferring education to study joining & artisanship. Both of Ulbricht's parents were members of the SPD(Social Democratic Party) which Walter would eventually register for in 1912. An impressionable teenage Ulbricht had radicalized his views to the point where he joined the Communist Party of Germany after deserting the army twice during the great war. Post-war, Ulbricht was elected to the party's central committee. Seeing to bolshevize the communist party as well as reorganizing it into an operational cell structure. Walter would become an instrumental member of the party, eventually being elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the Communist Party. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Ulbricht fled the country to live abroad working as a KPD operative, rigorously persecuting Troksyites and other deviants. Ulbricht returned to eastern occupied Germany in 1945 to assist in the reconstruction of the KPD and eventual merger with the SPD to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party). By 1949 with the establishment of the DDR, Walter was appointed deputy prime minister of the state and created the General Secretary position in the administration. By Pieck's death in 1960, Walter swiftly consolidated power and eliminated all opponents of his, ensuring de-Stalinization would not occur in the DDR. Until the unveiling of the Berlin wall, Ulbricht's authority over the economy saw little liberalization with massive surveillance over the people of East Germany. Eight years after the death of Stalin, Ulbricht seemingly remains the last man in the bloc who continues to embrace Stalinization. The question remains, what will the union's new leadership think of this."

Living quite a modest life alongside his four siblings and parents, Mátyás's family moved to Hungary. In his early 20s, Rákosi embraced social democracy, later becoming a communist supporter. Rákosi believed that atheism was a core value of the communist cause, eventually denouncing his personal Jewish faith. Serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the great war, Rákosi was captured as a prisoner of war in the Russian Army. In 1918, Rákosi returned to Hungary as a staunch communist undertaking commissar duties in the short-lived Hungarian Communist Bela Kun regime. Mátyás was forced to flee to Moscow due to the counter-revolution in Hungary, and in 1924 dispatched back to Hungary to reorganize the Communist party in the country. Followed by multiple arrests by Hungarian authorities and an eventual life-sentence in 1934. While serving as the Hungarian Communist party chief in exile, Rakosi would return to the homeland in 1944 followed by Soviet troops. Ultimately becoming secretary of the Hungarian communist party, Rákosi has been exposed as a staunch Stalinist.

Truman scarcely saw President Roosevelt, and received no briefing on the development of the atomic bomb or the unfolding difficulties with Soviet Russia. Suddenly these and a host of other wartime problems became Truman’s to solve when, on April 12, 1945, he became President. He told reporters, \"I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\"\nTruman was born in Lamar, Missouri, in 1884. He grew up in Independence, and for 12 years prospered as a Missouri farmer.\nHe went to France during World War I as a captain in the Field Artillery. Returning, he married Elizabeth Virginia Wallace, and opened a haberdashery in Kansas City.\n\nActive in the Democratic Party, Truman was elected a judge of the Jackson County Court (an administrative position) in 1922. He became a Senator in 1934. During World War II he headed the Senate war investigating committee, checking into waste and corruption and saving perhaps as much as 15 billion dollars.\nAs President, Truman made some of the most crucial decisions in history. Soon after V-E Day, the war against Japan had reached its final stage. An urgent plea to Japan to surrender was rejected. Truman, after consultations with his advisers, ordered atomic bombs dropped on cities devoted to war work. Two were Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japanese surrender quickly followed.\nIn June 1945 Truman witnessed the signing of the charter of the United Nations, hopefully established to preserve peace.\n\nThus far, he had followed his predecessor’s policies, but he soon developed his own. He presented to Congress a 21-point program, proposing the expansion of Social Security, a full-employment program, a permanent Fair Employment Practices Act, and public housing and slum clearance. The program, Truman wrote, “symbolizes for me my assumption of the office of President in my own right.” It became known as the Fair Deal.\nDangers and crises marked the foreign scene as Truman campaigned successfully in 1948. In foreign affairs he was already providing his most effective leadership.\nIn 1947 as the Soviet Union pressured Turkey and, through guerrillas, threatened to take over Greece, he asked Congress to aid the two countries, enunciating the program that bears his name–the Truman Doctrine. The Marshall Plan, named for his Secretary of State, stimulated spectacular economic recovery in war-torn western Europe."

In 1946 Sokolovsky took command of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, helping oversee the development of the indigenous Socialist Unity Party of Germany as the principal communist party in Soviet controlled Germany. In 1948 Sokolovsky walked out of the Allied Control Council, effectively ending interallied cooperation on the German occupation. This has heightened tensions in Europe between the Soviet Union and its former wartime allies in the West. Sokolovsky remains resistant to any perceived allied interference and oversees the continued development of local communism in his territory."

 POLITICS_TITO_DESC:0 "§YPresident of Yugoslavia, Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Minister of Defense of Yugoslavia, President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia §!\nThe son of a large peasant family, Josip Broz Tito grew up with much hardship and poverty. He spent his early years working in different factories across the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, the Russians captured him but during the Russian Revolution he left his prison camp and actively participated in the revolution. His experience prepared Tito when he returned home to agitate for communist unrest against the Yugoslavian monarchy. Despite facing arrest and unemployment, Tito emerged as a leading party member, surviving Yugoslavian and Soviet purges. Tito rose to global prominence during World War II as he led the Yugoslavian partisans to eventual victory against the German occupation forces. He received recognition from the Allies and used his position as the recognized Prime Minister to re-constitute Yugoslavia under his complete control in 1945. He abolished the monarchy and purged non-communists. The post-war saw tensions rise between Tito and Stalin over the direction of the communist world. By 1948 the two leaders were split, and Tito has started a new series of purges against Stalinists to shore up his control over the country as power increasingly lies in his hands or with his closest supporters."

Prince Abd al-llah continues the difficult task of maintaining Hashemite rule over a deeply divided kingdom where the currents of different ideologies, ethnicities, and languages are increasingly clashing."
 POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "King Farouk I inherited the throne after his father died in 1936. The sixteen year had grown up in opulent luxury and almost complete isolation in the royal palace. His early reign began with much hope as he toured his country and promised to bring relief to Egypt's poverty-stricken population. His lack of political will combined with the Wafd and British actively hindering him caused Farouk to lose interest in governing. What initial goodwill he achieved largely dissipated during World War II as the massive allied military presence led to skyrocketing inflation that left many Egyptians in a dire state. His efforts during the war to leverage Egyptian cooperation for full independence led to the British military surrounding the palace to force him to capitulate to British demands. After the war he failed to negotiate a resolution on who would govern Sudan, he failed to secure a complete British withdrawal, and he led Egypt to military defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His decadent lifestyle of late-night gambling and womanizing combined with his recent failures have shook the peoples trust in his leadership. Although known for his charm and streaks of intelligence, so far the King has been unable or unwilling to make the changes Egyptians are increasingly clamoring for."

After securing Samos's union to Greece after the First Balkan War, he joined the Greek parliament and served as a minister to the Thessaloniki government that opposed King Constantine I. In 1924 he became head of the centrist Liberal Party and Prime Minister for the first of three times. During the turbulent interwar years Sofoulis was a source of moderation and compromise, able to establish relationships across the political spectrum. During World War II he was briefly detained by the Germans during their occupation of Greece but he refused to back the National Liberation Front due to its connection to communism. After World War II Sofouils offered proposals to avoid civil war, though these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1947 he returned to the Prime Minister post for a third time and currently leads the Greek government against the Democratic Army of Greece."
 POLITICS_NASSER_DESC:0 "Growing up, Gamal Abdel Nasser moved constantly due to his father's job as a postal worker. This exposure to the many facets of Egyptian life and the vast disparity in wealth across society had a profound impact on him. Early on Nasser read Egyptian nationalist poems, books, and participated in anti-government protests, fully embracing Egyptian nationalism. Despite his known police record as an agitator he joined the Royal Military Academy with aspirations of following the footsteps of history's great revolutionaries. While training, he connected with likeminded nationalist officers and created a close network through his ability to charm and connect with people. This network evolved into the underground anti-monarchy Association of Free Officers in 1949. Two events pushed Nasser and his fellow nationalist officers down a revolutionary path. One was the British intimidation of King Farouk I in 1942, this event demonstrated to Nasser the monarchy's impotence in the face of colonialism. Second, the utter military failure of Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Nasser and his officers felt Egypt's fighting men fought bravely but were let down by faulty equipment, royal indifference, and poor preparation from the King. After these events, Nasser worked to ensure the Association of Free Officers were prepared to move against the government when the time came.  The successful revolution would end the nearly two century long Muhammad Ali Dynasty in Egypt and break the dominance of society by the elite. Nasser quickly stood out among the Free Officers for his ability to talk to the average Egyptian, his natural charisma, and passionate belief securing a bright future for the people of Egypt."

Becoming politically active in the 1920s, Kenyatta travelled across British East Africa on a motorbike converting to Christianity and  developing a staunch anti-colonialist viewpoint as he witnessed the suffering and inefficiency colonialism brought on the region. After living in Britain and making friends with more radical elements of the British Labor party, Kenyatta travelled to Moscow with George Padmore where he was increasingly radicalized by anti-imperialist sentiment. After being a writer for the British Communist Party, Kenyatta and Padmore left the Soviet Union in protest after the abolishment of the 'International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'. However, Kenyatta became increasingly moderate and more politically conservative after his education in economics and phenotics while still keeping to his Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist roots. Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in the 1940s where he would establish himself as the undisputed leader of the Kenyan African Union. Being imprisoned during the Mau Mau uprising for his political activities, Kenyatta openly denounced any form of civil disobedience or illegal action against the colonial regime. Now that he is free from his wrongful imprisonment, Jomo Kenyatta is determined to lead Kenya to a future of economic and social prosperity."

Soon after, he began implementing the Corrective Movement to undo the ruinous changes by his predecessor and building a sustainable Socialist model for Syria. His Presidency notably brought the Alawites; Shiite offshoots native to the Levant into the political stage. As expect with how his rise was compared to a 'Jew becoming a Tsar' or an 'Untouchable becoming a Maharajah', the Sunni majority sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood began to resent him and Ba'athist secularism.

He was familiarized with the military apparatus, then given authority over Syrian involvement in Lebanon. In addition, he was made the face of the anti-corruption drive in the government and took head of the Syrian Computer Society.

Mobutu can be charismatic and jovial in some setting but entirely homicidal and psychopathic in others, he is entirely unpredictable which made him very useful as an unempathetic, self-concerned, indigenous collaborator in the colonial force publique under Belgium.

In his program of "Authenticité"(To authenticate Congolese nationalism), Mobutu has attempted to culturally Africanize the people and state of Zaire through strict legal force. Banning Christian names, forcing the populous to adopt new state-mandated ones, and banning all usage of western clothing are showing quick results. These Africanization initiatives have bolstered his supporters in the Popular Movement of the Revolution. Conversely, foreign observers and large amounts of Congolese expats are very critical of Mobutu in response to his widespread openly presented human rights violations."

Like many Congolese, Patrice Lamumba is accustom to using three or four languages on a daily basis and as a scholar of the French language, Lamumba took interest in the literature of the prominent French thinkers of the enlightenment. Being a traveling beer salesmen who wrote part time poetry however, was not satisfying enough for Lamumba and in 1958 he founded his political party of the Mouvement Nationale Congolais. Lamumba had shown himself to represent his party well in the pan-Africanist All-African People's Conference in Accras where he impressed Kwame Nkrumah with his intelligence and precise plans for independence of his nation. Like Nkrumah, Lamumba based his party on a Pan-Africanist belief and wanted to create a new Congolese identity devoid of ethnic favoritism. Speaking for his party at the Belgian roundtables, Lamumba won the national election held a month before independence. Now being in power Lamumba has found himself in a political power struggle between the President of the country, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The power of the Prime Minister and the President are poorly defined in the constitution and the disagreements between the conservative federalist Kasa-Vubu with the leftist centralist Lamumba may lead the government into paralysis."

Nonetheless, he caught the interest of the Free officers led by Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser. As most of the Free officers were young and from low backgrounds, Nasser wanted Naguib onboard to give the group credibility. In 1952 the Free Officers helped Naguib win election as president of the officers club in opposition to a man backed by King Farouk. On July 1952, the Free Officers commenced the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with a coup d'état to depose King Farouk. Naguib was appointed, first as Commander-in-Chief of Army, in order to keep the armed forces firmly behind the junior officers' coup. Naguib was not a member of the executive committee of the Free Officers and he first learned of the coup several hours after it had begun  when he was awoken by a phone call telling him the coup had begun. In Egyptian culture, age is respected and as a 51-year-old, Naguib commanded more respect than did Nasser, who was 34 years old. Nagiub's avuncular and jovial personality was felt to make him seem a reassuring figure to the Egyptian people, instead of Nasser and the other Free Officers who were completely unknown to the public before the coup.\n\nNow leading Egypt, he hopes to see a speedy return to constitutional government without unnecessary violence."

Most famously, he successfully prosecuted Mafioso kingpin Charles Luciano on charges of forced prostitution in 1936. Luciano was given a 30- to 50-year prison sentence. He also prosecuted and convicted Waxey Gordon, another prominent New York City gangster and bootlegger, on charges of tax evasion. Dewey almost succeeded in apprehending Jewish mobster Dutch Schultz as well, but Schultz was murdered in 1935 in a hit ordered by The Commission itself; he had disobeyed The Commission's order forbidding him from making an attempt on Dewey's life. Dewey led the moderate faction of the Republican Party during the 1940s and 1950s, in opposition to conservative Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft.
