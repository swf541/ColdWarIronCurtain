 ZSL.1.d:0 "The ZSL, the United People’s Party, was created after a merger of the communist party Stronnictwo Ludowe and remnants of the People’s Party; led by Józef Niecko, the party proclaims a view of agrarianism and agrarian socialism. It is seen and functions as a satellite party for the Communist PZPR, the Polish United Worker’s Party, and the main intention of the so-called ‘satellite’ is to represent the rural workers of Poland. A few Polish politicians have been praising the creation of this new party and have congratulated Józef himself for his stellar work."
 ZSL.2.d:0 "Known physician and politician Tadeusz Michejda, senator for the National Worker’s Party in the 1930s and Minister of Health in Poland, has formally declared his intention to endorse the recently-created ZSL, praising the agrarian policies and the focus that the party has on rural workers, who are often overlooked in the increasingly urbanized society that Poland faces. The ZSL has thanked the politician for his praises, recognizing not only his work in Poland but, as they say, a “champion of Socialism”."
 PolandRel.2.d:0 "Professor and Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski was recently arrested following a crackdown of several elements of Polish society and is now imprisoned at Rywald; the Polish government cites treasonous behavior for the ongoing wave of arrests, followed by mass trials and imprisonments. He had been recently elevated to the rank of cardinal priest by the Pope and was an avid social worker and aided several Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland, before heading a restoration project in Wloclawek post-war. Many are deeming this arrest a grave injustice against the Church and the people of Poland themselves."
