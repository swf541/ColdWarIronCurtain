 Shlomo_Shamir_desc:0 "Shlomo Shamir was born as Shlomo Rabinowitch in Berdychiv, Russian Empire 15th of June 1915. He was taken to Palestine in 1925 and in 1929 he joined the Haganah and was instrumental in smuggling weapons and illegal Jewish immigrants into Palestine during the time of the British Mandate and the White Paper of 1939. In 1940 he received his pilot license, and in the same year he joined the Royal Air Force in order to fight the Nazis and gain experience in warfare. In 1946 he was discharged from the British military with the rank of major. In 1948 he was ordered by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to lead the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade in the fight to conquer Latrun. He was also instrumental in creating the Burma Road. At the end of the 1947-1949 Palestine war he was offered to be appointed as the Chief of the General Staff, but he refused. Instead he served other capacities, eventually becoming the Commander of the Israeli Navy."

 israel.5.d:0 "Today the State of Israel has officially been introduced into the United Nations, decided upon in an intense vote that resulted in a 37-12 decision, sealing the fragile thing that is the Jewish nation's independence, for now at least. With Israel showing some degree of support for the UN partition plan, it is anyone's guess if peace will be achieved, but no doubt many believe this to be the first step in a series of many. As the Western World begins to establish ties and show their support for the infant state, Israel's Arab neighbors are enraged, still reeling from their previous failure to eliminate Israel. The revived Jewish state has now left its first modern mark on history."
 israel.6.d:0 "Following months of heated negotiations, the Lausanne Conference, convened by the United Nations, has finally come to an end. The issues of the conference mainly concerned the fallout from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - including borders, the split of Jerusalem and the 700,000 Palestinian refugees created by the conflict. The demarcation line established after the conflict, seeing Israel control 60% of the original partition plan for a Palestinian state, has been maintained despite further Israeli demands and to the outrage of the Arab States. In addition, the Israelis refused to allow any refugees back to their old homes and rejected the '100,000 refugees offer' proposed by the UN. While tensions remain high and Egypt and Jordan still occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it appears that the fragile peace in the region has been maintained and Israel's admission to the United Nations should help lead to a peaceful future for the incredibly volatile region."

 israel.8.d:0 "In a historic event for our nation, the very first local elections have been held throughout the country. The system works so that the residents of cities and local councils vote for a mayor, as well as electing members of the local and city councils, with these votes occurring every legislative election. For the first time since the Arab War, Palestinians have been allowed to vote for their local councilors and so far the whole process has gone smoothly, without any significant reports of political violence. With results continuing to trickle in, the people of Israel are finally able to look back upon the constant conflict of the 40's, for the first time, from a position of relative peace and security."
 israel.7.d:0 "Ever since our victory in the War of Independence the situation on the Syrian border has been tense, with no official peace treaty ever being signed. The United Nations Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission has been working to observe the terms of the armistice and after many months of negotiations an agreement has finally been made. Under the terms of the Israeli-Syrian General Armistice Agreement, Syrian forces have evacuated occupied territories west of the International Border, which have now become demilitarized zones. Syria still officially maintains control of these areas. However, despite the success of the armistice negotiations, many still doubt the possibility of a lasting peace in the region."

 israelelection.1:0 "1951 Knesset Election"
 israelelection.1.d:0 "During 1950, a divide formed between David Ben-Gurion and Mapai and their religious coalition partners, the divide was over education of new immigrants and the inclusion of women in the IDF, David Ben-Gurion wants to give new immigrants secular education and to include women in the IDF while the religious parties fiercely oppose both, the tensions became apparent when Mapai's Education program was shot down in the Knesset, Ben-Gurion took this failure as a Vote of no Confidence in his government, he then announced the dissolution of his government and called for early elections. Despite all these setbacks coupled with growing support for the capitalist and centrist General Zionists and other parties, Mapai still appears to be dominant, but their position may be in danger as the new Immigrants become more and more disillusioned with the Mapai regime and may vote for more fringe parties such as the right wing Herut or the hardline socialist Mapam.

 BEN_GURION_DESC:0 "Long time de-facto leader of the labor Zionist movement and now the first Prime Minister of Israel. Ben-Gurion always had his suspicions for both the far-left and far-right, refusing to include the fellow socialist Mapam in his coalition and utterly refusing to listen to any of the nationalist Herut's demands. He also believes that Israel should retaliate to infiltrations and attacks from Arab countries and will do anything for Israel to be a force to be reckoned with. For now he remains unchallenged, but sooner or later, he could be replaced by the ever more influential younger generations who seek to replace the older generation of the Second Aliyah who held dominance over politics of the Zionist movement and now the Jewish State."
 Sharett_desc:0 "Moshe Sharett is a very different figure than David Ben-Gurion, he is a dove in a party filled with hawks and prefers to use diplomacy to achieve his goals rather than take up arms. When Israel was established, he was appointed as Foreign Minister, he served in that post diligently, scheduling meetings between David Ben-Gurion and Arab leaders. Sharett opposes aggression or 'adventurism' and believes that Israel needs to be satisfied with the 1949 borders in order for peace to exist in this tumultuous region. Even while being a minority in Mapai, he was given the nomination by the party and now serves as Prime Minister of Israel."
 Lavon_desc:0 "Former Defense Minister and an influential member of Mapai, Pinhas Lavon has finally reached the top after an internal power struggle within Mapai. Known as a cunning yet devious figure, Lavon pulls the strings from behind to achieve his goals. Lavon now serves as Prime Minister after giving Mapai an electoral comeback that inserted them back at the top."

 Golda_desc:0 "Former Minister of Labor and now Prime Minister, Golda Meir's tough nature has returned her and Mapai to power after a series of defeats. Golda Meir's more direct approach at problem solving reminds many of David Ben-Gurion, how will the 'Iron Lady' of Israel fare in the ever tumultuous Middle East?"
 Begin_young_desc:0 "Former leader of the Irgun and leader of the nationalist Herut, Menachem Begin was swept to office by a populist wave and now is free to enact his mentor, Ze'ev Jabotinsky's vision for Israel as well as his own vision.

 Yaari_desc:0 "Leader of Mapam and a socialist activist, Meir Ya'ari has ascended to power following a populist wave that swept his rival, Mapai out of power.

 Rokach_desc:0 "Former Mayor of Tel Aviv and leader of the General Zionists, Israel Rokach has emerged victorious with the public becoming disillusioned with Mapai's austerity policies and have finally 'screamed' with them electing him and his capitalist General Zionists. Finally in power, he is free to enact capitalist policies that will remodel Israel's economy to more strongly resemble those of the West and perhaps will usher a new era for the Zionist movement with Liberalism dominating instead of Socialism."
 israel.9.d:0 "In a remarkable discovery over recent years, scrolls containing ancient Jewish manuscripts have been found in the Qumran Caves. These caves are near the Dead Sea, a Salt Lake located in the hotly contested region of the West Bank. While the scrolls themselves were discovered in 1947, it's only in more recent years that teams have made efforts to excavate them. As the historical significance of them has become more and more apparent, their value has increased and the search progress has subsequently accelerated rapidly. After five years of excavations, the last scrolls have finally been recovered from the cave. In total there are 972 manuscripts with 7 scrolls, found in a total of 11 caves. The recovery of these ancient scrolls represents a considerable step forward for the study of both the Jewish faith and the Hebrew Language, as the rush to understand the contents of the scrolls has began."
 israel.10.d:0 "After lifting the British restriction on Jewish immigration and securing our independence, the number of Jews moving to Israel from all around the world skyrocketed, with more Iraqi, Iranian, Moroccan and Yemenite Jews moving in ever increasing numbers. While the state will have to adjust to taking care of such a rapidly increasing population, the immigrants are full of joy and hope upon reaching their new home where they shall finally live free."
 israel.11.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the country, there was a great debate on what the school curriculum should look like. Mapai and other secular parties want children to have a general education similar to that in the West, while HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi and other Ultra-Orthodox parties want to introduce religious education to 'revive the Jewish spirit of the nation'. This debate doesn't seem close to ending since Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has to appease both sides in order to keep his increasingly unstable coalition together."
 israel.12.d:0 "The Palmach, which fought valiantly alongside the IDF in the war of Independence, has been dissolved and integrated into the mainstream IDF, Ben-Gurion stated that he wants to 'de-politicize' the Palmach, as he sees it as too closely tied to Mapam, which he holds animosity and suspicion towards."
 israel.13.d:0 "Immigration camps, many of which were recently turned into Transition Camps or Ma'abarot in the wake of increasing influx of Jewish Immigrants, are constantly popping up across Israel, while the government did reserve as many apartments and houses they could, even those were not enough to hold the tens of thousands of Jews that arrive each month. Many new immigrants now live in the Ma'abarot, where conditions are harsh, according to a journalist visiting a Ma'abara 'there were two faucets for everyone, About a thousand people. The toilets had no roof and were infested with flies.'"

 israel.16.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion has appointed Pinchas Lavon, a senior Mapai member to act as Defense Minister after the former served at that post since 1948, many speculate that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion is planning to retire from politics."
 israel.17.d:0 "Mordechai Maklef, who was appointed as Yigal Yadin's replacement following the latter's resignation, has offered his own resignation, after being unable to cooperate with Minister of Defense. the Prime Minister has swiftly appointed the relatively young Moshe Dayan as the new Chief of Staff."
 israel.18.d:0 "Facing electoral defeat, Mapai was sent into a frenzy as Ben-Gurion's leadership position seemed more vulnerable than ever, Levi Eshkol, a 'centrist' in his party and the compromiser figure, was approached by anti Ben-Gurionist figures asking him for his opinion on them ousting Ben-Gurion. The destiny of Mapai depends on Eshkol's decision, Eshkol decides to..."

Levi Eshkol isn't excited to become party leader just yet and suggested the new leadership to name Golda Meir their nominee in case he turns the nomination down. After a short time of deliberation, Eshkol decides to..."
 israel.22.d:0 "The Fedayeen, a Palestinian nationalist militia, has started a wave of terrorist attacks on Israeli targets and civilians, the IDF and the government will now have to cope with that reality."
 israel.23.d:0 "The Fedayeen have attacked a military convoy today, with several wounded, this corresponds with a current wave of attacks perpetuated by the Fedayeen militias, some advisers call for 'reprisal operations' in Fedayeen territory to disarm or at least weaken them for a while, other commanders advise to 'wait and see' what happens."
 israel.24.d:0 "IDF forces have entered Gaza a couple of days ago and are now reporting that they have found and destroyed Fedayeen bases there, this operation severely weakens the Fedayeen as one of its main bases is now destroyed."
 israel.25.d:0 "The IDF reports that they have found and destroyed the last Fedayeen bases in the West Bank effectively incapacitating the militia, experts say that the Fedayeen won't be a threat to Israeli security any longer after this operation."
 israel.26.d:0 "The Kastner Trial has ended today, when the trial started it seemed like it was going to be about the defendant, Malchiel Gruenwald accusation of Mapai member Rudolf Kastner's alleged cooperation with the Nazis during the Holocaust, Gruenwald's lawyer, Shmuel Tamir, has managed to flip the case and made it about Mapai's role in the Holocaust and how much it tried to help Jews escape from the Nazis. After much deliberation, the judge ruled in Gruenwald's favor, accusing Kastner of having 'sold his soul to the devil.". Kastner's membership in Mapai coupled with the findings of the court made Herut submit a motion of no-confidence in the Knesset, this motion failed to pass, but the damage has been done to Mapai."
 israel.27.d:0 "In preparation for the elections in July, leaders of the HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael have met to discuss the future of their alliance, most say that the alliance is shaky at best and should be dissolved, but some voices say that a united front helps promote their shared interests most effectively, after hours of deliberation, the leadership announces that..."
 israel.28.d:0 "Herut and the United Religious Front have always had a disdain for Mapai, even though the latter showed it more overtly. Today, the leader of Herut, Menachem Begin has sent a letter to Chaim-Moshe Shapira proposing an electoral alliance between Herut and the URF citing that if he is to accept, that Herut will move to promote 'Jewish values' and 'Religious purity', he also said that any alliance against Mapai is a good step towards ending the 'socialist regime'. While some may disagree, this is indeed a good offer on Begin's part, after a short time thinking about the proposal, Shapira has sent a reply to Begin confirming his support for the alliance."
 israel.30.d:0 "Our recent decision to start the purchase of weapons from the United States has angered Mapam, who is decidedly pro-USSR, it angered them so much that they introduced a motion of no confidence, luckily this motion didn't pass and it just shows that Mapam stands alone against our plans."
 israel.49.d:0 "A week ago, The Knesset decided to ban Shabbat public transportation, what following was a few radio operators talking about it badly, and how it caused them problems going to their own workplace. But last Sunday, during an interview with Ben Gurion in the radio station Kol Yisrael, he publicly stated \"The ban on Shabbat Transportation was a mistake that was up to the voters' hand and mind, their empathy towards URF has gone exceedingly wrong, and the elections have proven that.\" The Government has not responded yet, but seems to have not ignored it. In Beit HaKnesset, in Jerusalem, a small demonstration have gathered up against it in a Wednesday morning, Ben Gurion was not on scene, but a Heirut MK Uri Zvi Greenberg was seen entering the Knesset and was shouted on by the demonstrators."
 israel.50.d:0 "Following the victory of the Herut-URF alliance, Prime Minister Begin has announced his plan for the economy: a 'mixed' economy mixing socialism and capitalism while following Jabotinsky's '5 Mems'."
 israel.51.d:0 "A government proclamation today has declared Judea and Samaria or the West Bank as an integral part of Israel. This decision raised tensions with Jordan who see this claim as jingoistic and imperialistic. Prime Minister Begin has proclaimed that "Judea and Samaria are a core and indivisible part of the land of Israel and hence the State of Israel.""
 israel.52.d:0 "Revisionist Youth movement Beitar have endorsed the government's policies as following the "spirit of Jabotinsky" and that they will lead to a "better Israel"."
 israel.53.d:0 "The United Religious Front is experiencing increasingly damaging divides and internal conflicts between two factions. The "old guard" who rallied under URF leader Haim Moshe-Shapira and the more national minded "young guard" led by Yosef Burg. The old guard sees the Herut alliance as not benefiting them enough and wish to leave the alliance but stay in the government while the young guard wish to continue or even solidify the alliance with Herut to create a big-tent right wing front in Israeli politics."
 israel.54.d:0 "URF leader Haim Moshe-Shapira has announced today that the Herut-URF alliance will be dissolved effective this evening. Prime Minister Begin has replied saying that the dissolution is a "setback" but calls for further cooperation between Herut and the URF as independent parties."
 israel.55.d:0 "Socialist youth have gone to Jerusalem to protest controversial laws introduced by the government such as the ban on Public Transport in Shabbat. They have called the government to resign but were met with deaf ears. Israeli-Arabs have joined them to protest government privileging its Jewish citizens over its non-Jewish ones. While the protest was large, Herut still remains rather popular with Mapai and other socialist parties struggling to regain their past strength."
 israel.56.d:0 "Prime Minister Begin has decided to call an election in 1955 with Herut still remaining the most popular party. Mapai is planning on a rebound and branding itself as the party for seculars against the "religious fundamentalists" of the Herut-URF alliance while the General Zionists have decided to take a more calm and moderate approach."
 israelOlim.1.d:0 "Many Olim object having to endure the conditions in Ayarot Pituach that we built for them, after an inspection those conditions turned out to be quite bad. While helping the new Olim in improving their conditions should be the obvious thing to do, we are also very short on resources and will need every last resource that we have on hand."
 israelOlim.2.d:0 "A number of Moroccan Jews have filed a complaint to the government citing how they were sprayed with gases and humiliated upon arriving to Israel, this matches a pattern of disdain with our methods of 'integrating' the new Olim from the Middle East and North Africa, should we launch a probe and satisfy them or dismiss the complaint and use our resources on something else?"
 israelOlim.3.d:0 "A number of Olim are facing challenges while trying to integrate into Israeli society, many Olim, especially from the Middle East are traditional in nature while a large part of Israeli society is secular and 'atheist' in nature, so challenges are bound to happen, what we can do is to start a government program to aid the Olim at the expense of resources."
 israelOlim.4.d:0 "Due to growing resentment with government policy, the new Olim are looking for an alternative to Mapai, there are currently two parties that represent that alternative, the right wing Herut, which criticizes Mapai day and night, and the hardline socialist Mapam, which works to end racial discrimination in the country."
 israelOlim.5.d:0 "A number of Olim arriving to Israel have voiced their concern to the government, they're concerned about not having anywhere affordable to live. Many urged the government to build 'development towns' or 'Ayarot Pituach' to house the Olim until the situation normalizes."
 israelpresidents.1.d:0 "Despite his poor health, Chaim Weizmann has decided to stand for re-election as President of Israel, even though no other candidates stood against him, a vote was held anyway and Weizmann has been elected with an absolute majority of votes in the Knesset and will continue to serve as President."
 israelpresidents.2.d:0 "Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel has just passed away at the age of 77 in Rehovot, he was buried alongside his wife at the Weizmann estate. the academic verdict on his grave says that he was a 'patriot long before Israel even existed'."
 israelpresidents.3.d_1:0 "Since President Weizmann died in office, an early Presidential election has been held to elect his successor, the candidates are Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Ben-Gurion's friend and the Mapai candidate for President and Mordechai Nurock, a Latvian Jew exiled by the USSR after serving in the Latvian Parliament and the Mizrachi party candidate."
 israelpresidents.3.d_2:0 "Since President Weizmann died in office, an early Presidential election has been held to elect his successor, Since Albert Einstein accepted the government's offer to serve as the President, no party sent a candidate to challenge him, securing his election with no opposition."
 israelpresidents.4.d:0 "The famed scientist Albert Einstein is considered to be the greatest Jew alive, and since the President Chaim Weizmann died, Ben-Gurion proposed the idea of inviting Einstein to serve as the the new President. The Ambassador to the United States Abba Ebban has presented this offer to Albert Einstein, saying that the office will not interfere with his scientific studies and he would be free to pursue his hobbies. After thinking for a short time, Einstein presented his response."
 lavonmania.1.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion, leader of Mapai and Prime Minister of Israel, has decided to retire today, he says that the retirement was for personal non-political reasons. His sudden decision to retire and live in the small Kibbutz in the Negev of Sde Boker has launched Mapai into a scramble to find his replacement. Eventually, Moshe Sharett, Minister of Foreign Affairs has emerged as the party's choice to be Ben-Gurion's replacement and will now fill his place as Prime Minister."
 lavonmania.2.d:0 "Following the agreement between our ally Britain and Egypt, who is hostile to us, to withdraw British forces from the Suez Canal by 1956, the IDF High Command was left nervous watching on. The Suez Canal is an important trading point for Israeli ships, and if Britain withdraws from the canal, Egypt could block Israeli ships from entering the canal. Following that assessment, some men in the IDF High Command proposed the idea of initiating a false flag operation to bomb British owned businesses near the Canal, in order to give an air of instability and convince the British to withdraw from the treaty and remain in the canal. This idea was largely rejected by most of the IDF High Command who proposed that Israel should try and remain diplomatic without taking any reckless measures."
 lavonmania.3.d:0 "In an operation that was taken place without the consent of the Prime Minister, a sleeper cell of Israeli agents tried to attack several sites in the Suez Canal as a false flag operation in hopes of preventing the British from leaving the canal. All agents were caught, interrogated and imprisoned by the Egypt who discovered their allegiance to Israel. This is a major diplomatic incident as the government was thrown into confusion as to who's responsible to the operation. Prime Minister Sharett didn't know about the operation when it took place and Defense Minister Lavon claims innocence even though many suspicions have arisen regarding his involvement in the operation."
 lavonmania.4.d:0 "Following Operation Shoshanna, an unprecedented government crisis has occurred with Lavon blackmailing Sharett in order to keep his position as Defense Minister. Sharett couldn't replace Lavon with anyone as defense minister as no candidate accepted the offer. As a last ditch effort, Sharett and Golda Meir travelled to Sde Boker to see David Ben-Gurion and offer him the position of Minister of Defense. Ben-Gurion accepted the offer and has now returned to the government, just after Lavon resigned from his position as Defense Minister."
 lavonmania.5.d:0 "With suspicions that Lavon may have given the order to commence Operation Shoshanna rising and tensions mounting, Pinhas Lavon has decided to resign from his post as Minister of Defense. Many herald this as the end of Lavon's once promising political career."
 lavonmania.6.d:0 "With Ben-Gurion back in the government, Sharett knew that his days were numbered and has decided to resign from his position as Prime Minister, giving it back to Ben-Gurion. Sharett agreed to remain as Minister of Foreign Affairs but has decided to resign in order to give the Prime Ministry to the more "strongminded" Ben-Gurion."
 lavonmania.7.d:0 "In the aftermath of Operation Shoshanna, Moshe Sharett tried to investigate the cause of the operation and who gave the order hence he started the Committee of Two. The Committee of Two, or the Olshan-Dori Committee, investigated the government as to who gave the order to carry out Shoshanna. After some time, the committee reported back stating that they can't find enough evidence to link anyone to the operation."

 israel.9999.d:0 "Against all odds, the Arab coalition sent to squash the upstart Jewish State have been pushed back and as ceasefires are being declared, the new State of Israel is establishing itself as a sovereign state on the world stage. Though not all is well as the new state now has to struggle against the tides of ideology and the intensifying exodus of Jews from the Diaspora. Can Israel survive this time of turmoil and prosper?"
 israelOlim.99.d_1:0 "With Government programs swiftly helping Olim integrate into society, many Olim express their thanks to the government that provided them with a new start for their lives. They say that Israel truly is the safe haven of Jews all around the world."
 israelOlim.99.d_2:0 "With limited government aid, many Olim have expressed their disappointment with government policy. While the situation could heal with time, the Olim still face struggles integrating into society."
 israelOlim.99.d_3:0 "With virtually no government aid, many Olim have expressed their anger with the government, tensions are rising in cities with significant Olim populations and resentment to the government has been put firmly in place. While wounds could heal, the general consensus is that that most Olim resent the Mapai regime and will probably continue to resent it for the years to come."
 israel.9998.d:0 "Even before the declaration of independence, one party has become the center of gravity of Israeli politics, the Worker's Party of the Land of Israel or 'Mapai' for short. Under the leadership of the charismatic and savvy David Ben-Gurion, Mapai positioned itself between the liberal capitalistic General Zionists and the revolutionary socialists of Mapam. Even though Mapai is not afraid to cooperate with non-Socialists, David Ben-Gurion has sworn to never sit in a coalition with either the nationalist right wing Herut and the aforementioned Mapam. After winning Israel's first election 4 months ago in a landslide, David Ben-Gurion has established a 'Nation Building' coalition with the support of the center-left Progressive Party, the religious conservative United Religious Front and several other minor parties. The government has adopted a philosophy called "Mamlachtiut" which promotes official state organs in hopes of de-politicizing state institutions, time will tell if this policy will survive."
 maki.1.d:0 "Not so long ago, a member of Mapam, Michael Oren was arrested, trialed and imprisoned by the Czechoslovak government in a blatant show trial. Naturally this generated an uproar as Oren became the 'Prisoner of Prague' but the real trouble is happening within Mapam and the government. Prime Minister Ya'ari, Minister of Labor Shmuel Mikunis and other socialists distraught by the trials are considering condemning the Soviet Union and distance themselves from Communism, while Minister of Transport Moshe Sneh and a small cadre of 'loyalists' defend the actions of the USSR and urge the party to keep their pro-USSR policy. After hours of debating and bickering...."
 maki.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Ya'ari has announced a merger with the Communist Maki today, while this was to be expected, some feathers were ruffled, especially Mapai's who were quick to announce that this is a "Soviet Takeover"."
 maki.3.d:0 "Chairman Sneh has announced today that the 'Zionist Movement has ended' and that a new era will begin, a 'socialist era', he proclaimed the formation of the 'Socialist Commonwealth of Israel' or 'Socialist Commonwealth of Palestine' for its Arab citizens. The Commonwealth will be a binational, socialist and atheist state governed by Maki and Chairman Sneh."
 maki.4.d:0 "While we have secured our victory in the last election, one question was never settled, who will be the new leader of the party and thus Prime Minister? the moderate Shmuel Mikunis pushes for a neutral communist regime, not aligned with the USSR while Moshe Sneh pushes for Israel to be an ally of the USSR. Due to the talks going nowhere, many push Meir Vilner as a compromise candidate who will appease everyone, after days and nights of bickering and mudslinging, who will emerge as the new leader of the Maki-Mapam Alliance?"
 maki.5.d:0 "With Maki seeing Mapam compromise more and more towards their viewpoints, Makists are seeing an opening that they can use to have more leverage and perhaps even dominance of the Mapam-Maki Alliance, they plan to exploit the opening by appealing for the USSR to pressure Mapam into compromising into more of their positions."
 maki.6.d:0 "The USSR has replied today stating that they are ready to apply pressure on Mapam, now we need to wait and see what will happen."
 maki.7.d:0 "The USSR has rejected our request and stated that we aren't in the position to 'start the revolution', we will need to continue under Mapam's leadership."
 maki.8.d:0 "Prime Minister Ya'ari has announced his resignation with his position in the government being less and less secure by the moment. Even though he refrained from stating why he's resigning, many speculate that outside or rather inside forces are behind his resignation. His resignation triggers an early election for this year, where he will lead an interim government until election day."

 german_reparations.1.d:0 "The Federal Republic of Germany, more commonly known as West Germany have come with a proposal to us. Pay reparations for the losses of the Holocaust. While some in Mapai circles support the idea, the majority opposes it. While it is economically valuable, many see it as dismissing the losses of the holocaust and equating it to pieces of paper."
 german_reparations.2.d:0 "Menachem Begin's Herut has voiced outrage with the acceptance of the German Reparation agreement. He said that we are selling the blood of the victims of the Holocaust. His words echo through as more and more people voice their opposition to the agreement."
 german_reparations.3.d:0 "While the government hoped that the controversy surrounding the German Reparations Agreement would ease over and eventually fade away, it was anything but. Today, thousands of protesters gathered near the Knesset in a rally never seen before in our history. The protesters demand that we reject the West German Reparations plan and that we can't forgive the German for the Holocaust so easily."
 german_reparations.4.d:0 "Dov Shilansky has been arrested today while attempting to bring a suitcase bomb into the Foreign Ministry. He was accused of being a member of an underground organization opposed to the German Reparations Agreement and was sentenced to 2 years in prison."

 german_reparations.6.d:0 "Ben-Gurion has spoken today to a group of supporters saying that Israel needs to act like an \"independent people\" and not be "slaved away in the past" and that Israel needs the German Reparations to end its economic misery. While most of the public still opposes the agreement, Ben-Gurion's support of the agreement is unwavering."
 german_reparations.7.d:0 "Today Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett has signed the Reparation Agreements from Germany. Despite meeting monumental opposition from the public, the agreement has survived and now German Reparation money can aid Israel's economy."
 german_reparations.8.d:0 "The debate regarding German Reparations has ended, and the 'No' side seems to have won. The Government has announced that no reparations will happen. While the government tries to maintain good relations with West Germany, it acknowledged the public outcry and rejected the German proposal."
 israelelectionnews.1.d:0 "In its second election since its founding, the Israeli Workers Party of the Land of Israel, Mapai, celebrated the re-election of David Ben-Gurion to Parliament. Following a 37% in polls, the new government under the second Ben-Gurion cabinet was formed with the support of Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael, as well as the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. Known to the world as the Founding Father of Israel, Ben-Gurion, along with Mapai, is celebrated for introducing nation-wide Housing and Education reforms in an effort to give the Jewish people a home in the wake of the Holocaust. Now, with Mapai's power seemingly solidified once again, it appears that Ben-Gurion's plans for further development in Israel, including the construction of the National Water Carrier Aqueduct, as well as further settlement of Jews in the Negev, are all but assured."
 israelelectionnews.2.d:0 "The Israeli centrist party, known as the General Zionists Party, emerged victorious in this year's general election, with the new Prime Minister Israel Rokach promising sweeping modernization and reforms. Mayor of Tel Aviv since 1936, his tenure has been marked by his party's past lukewarm relations with the British. Nonetheless, Rokach proved an capable statesmen over the decades, expanding and nearly tripling the population of Tel Aviv during his time in office, eventually merging it with the Port City of Jaffa, despite Rokach's initial objections to the motion. Considered by some the \"Westerner\" sect of Israeli political landscape, the General Zionists Party is largely defined by European style liberalism, with an emphasis on the middle class and capitalism as their framework, and while many in the Israeli community find their policies uncomfortably reminiscent of British policies, the unpopular reaction to Ben-Gurion's strict Austerity measures made a General Zionist victory all but certain, with the primary campaign focus set on uprooting Mapai in favor of widespread economic reform."
 israelelectionnews.3.d:0 "Pro-USSR socialist party Mapam has defeated the ruling moderate socialist Mapai party in this year's Israeli election. Making their leader, Meir Ya'ari Prime Minister. Many incoming immigrants chose to vote for Mapam due to growing frustration with Mapai's integration policies but not willing to vote for non-socialist parties benefiting Mapam who won the vast majority of their votes."
 israelelectionnews.4.d:0 "Former leader of the paramilitary organization Irgun, Menachem Begin has led his right wing nationalist Herut party to victory in this year's Israeli election, many experts believe that he benefited from votes by the new immigrants who were frustrated with the policies of the ruling Mapai party making Begin and Herut receive a huge increase in votes and allowing them to win the election."

Yadin was recalled by Ben-Gurion to serve in the Haganah and later IDF in the War for Independence. At just age 32, Yadin has assumed full control of the IDF Chief of Staff role after former Chief of Staff Ya'akov Dori became unable to fill his role due to his illness. Yadin has made most of the important decisions for the IDF during the War of Independence, including the Ceasefire with Egypt that ended the war."

Dayan has lost his left eye during World War 2 while fighting on the side of the British and has worn his defining eyepatch ever since. Dayan is a member of Mapai and a close friend of David Ben-Gurion and has great political ambitions beyond military service."

Rabin joined the Haganah and received basic military training there. He later joined the Palmach section of the Haganah and later became a Commander. During the War of Independence, Rabin fought in the IDF as the commander of the Harel Brigade and later served as one of the Israeli delegates to the peace talks with Egypt in Rhodes.

After the war, Allon helped form Mapam but was warned by Ben-Gurion to move himself away from the party as it was a rival to his own Mapai. Allon now is the Commander of Southern Command."
 israel.57.d:0 "The Fedayeen and their Egyptian sponsors have attacked us for long enough, we have decided to act. Today, paratroops of the 890th battalion have landed in Khan Yunis to attack the Egyptian old Tegart Fort and another Egyptian emplacement codenamed Position 132 which dominates the near road which was vital to secure troop withdrawal. Later a Mechanized force led by commander Mordechai "Motte" Gur surrounded the fort while Rafael "Raful" Eitan's forces secured Position 132. All positions were secured by 22:45 hours, explosive charges were set to reduce the Tegart fort to rubble. 72 Egyptians were killed and only 1 Israeli got killed, an undeniable success."
 israel.58.d:0 "Egyptian forces have decided to blockade the Gulf of Eilat, so we have decided to surprise attack them on a rather undefended sector. At 20:00 hours the 890th Paratroop Brigade and the Nahal Brigade have attacked Egyptian emplacements in Ras-Siram with Mortar and Artillery support. By morning all Egyptian emplacements were destroyed and 81 Egyptians lay dead and 55 captured while we lost only 5 lives, a stunning victory and a great embarrassment for [EGY.GetLeader]."
 israel.59.d:0 "In order to stimulate the economy, the Government has decided to open trade with Britain. While Socialists like Mapai and Mapam protested it on economic grounds as well as Herut protesting the deal as "dealing with the devil" the deal has nevertheless been signed."
 israel.60.d:0 "The Israeli Middle Class was always overshadowed by the big and powerful working class and the all powerful Histadrut that was allowed to flourish under Mapai. No more, we will limit the Histadrut's powers to prevent it from taking total control of the Israeli economy and allow small businesses to prosper. Mapai and Mapam obviously jumped to attack this bill while Herut applauded the idea of limiting the power of trade unions. After a close vote, the bill has passed, we can only wait and see what'll happen now."
 israel.61.d:0 "The Histadrut has not responded in kind to our bill, in fact they responded with a letter expressing outrage and "immediate reprecussions" if we are to not cancel this bill. While this raised worries in the government, Prime Minister Rokach has decided to soldier on in hopes that the Histadrut is just bluffing."
 israel.62.d:0 "Terrible news, the Histadrut has called for protests from Tel Aviv to Haifa to Be'ersheba to Jerusalem in what the press call the "Red Summer". Workers chant "Stop the oppression of the labor movement", "Knesset is Unfair, Rokach is in there, standing at the concession, plotting his oppression" and some even started to sing the Internationale. This is a massive hit for the Rokach government as the economy is in a mess due to local strikes being issued by the Histadrut."
 israel.63.d:0 "Pressure on the Rokach government to stop the strikes is mounting, some suggested using riot police on them while many cried out that it'll only results in riots and violence. Rokach has decided to start talks and perhaps offer minor concessions to the Histadrut in turn for them to stop their protests. So far the talks are going nowhere but there is hope."
 israel.64.d:0 "Citing the failure of the Rokach administration to put a suitable deal, the Histadrut has called for one last General Strike to be held in hopes of delivering a "knockout" punch to the Rokach government. One the designated day, the streets of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem and other major cities were filled with protesters who openly call for the government to resign."
 israel.65.d:0 "Prime Minister Israel Rokach, under intense pressure from outside and inside his government has decided to resign effective immediately. "Citizens of Israel, I'm telling you today with a heavy heart that I have decided to resign.", "I only acted in the best interest of Israel, no malice, no agenda, only the betterment of our nation." Rokach has stated that Peretz Bernstein will assume his position as Prime Minister."
 israel.66.d:0 "One of the first acts of Prime Minister Peretz Bernstein is to sign an agreement with Histadrut secretary-general Pinhas Lavon offering concessions in turn for the Histadrut to stop the strikes, this agreement alienated Bernstein's base that sees it as a sign of weakness against the working class and the Histadrut."
 israel.67.d:0 "Peretz Bernstein has presented his government to the President today who approved its formation. The government will consist of Bernstein's General Zionists, Pinhas Rosen's Progressives, Haim-Moshe Shapira's Mafdal, the Religious Torah Front and Begin's Herut. An unstable coalition but Bernstein cited it as Israel's "first non-socialist government" and has shown confidence in it."
 israel.68.d:0 "The new Minister of Finance, Yosef Sapir has talked with Prime Minister Bernstein today to tell him about his idea on how to further stimulate and revive Israel's economy. The idea is for Israel to associate itself with the European Economic Community as an expansion of the trade deal with Britain. He argued that increased trade with western Europe will revive Israel's economy. Bernstein has reacted supportively and told him that he will do his best so see this idea through."
 israel.69.d:0 "In a speech in front of the EEC, Peretz Bernstein has announced of the plan to seek association with the EEC to "breath new life into Israel's ailing economy" he was met with applause from one side and fierce jeers from the other, especially from Mapai, Mapam and coalition member Herut who has decided to sever ties with the government over the proposal calling it a "devil's pact". Most MKs support this move as they see socialists economics as destined to fail and reacted supportively to the idea."
 israel.70.d:0 "Following its departure from the government, Herut has attacked the government on every opportunity. Today it even presented a motion of no confidence hoping to crack the government's support and forcing it to step down. This gamble failed as the remaining coalition members remained steady in their support of the government."
 israel.71.d:0 "Herut isn't alone in its opposition of EEC Association, Mapai and Mapam also voiced fierce opposition to it as they see it as "undermining Israel's domestic labor" and as "damaging to the worker". Both parties but especially Mapai are hoping to use opposition to EEC Association as a jumping point back to the government come next elections."
 israel.72.d:0 "Increase trade deals with Europe has stabilized the economy which even started to recover slowly, Bernstein quickly declared this a triumph of capitalism over socialism while Mapai and Mapam call it a "facade". If the trend continues, Israel's economy will recover and start to grow by 1961."
 israel.73.d:0 "Mapai and Mapam aren't the only socialists opposing EEC association, the Histadrut, the trade union which took down the Rokach government has voiced criticism of the idea of EEC association and declared its opposition to the notion of associating Israel with the EEC."
 israel.74.d:0 "The economy didn't only recover last month but it also boomed, thanks to the government's trade policies. Bernstein and the General Zionists are continuously climbing in the polls thanks to the economic boom and Bernstein is contemplating holding early elections to capitalize on his economic success."
 israel.75.d:0 "Prime Minister Bernstein has called for an early election this year, capitalizing on his recent economic success which he hopes will make the people "forget" the controversies surrounding his party's government. Mapai is hoping to change the subject back to that of EEC Association and return to power on the back of the working class anti-EEC vote."
 israel.76.d:0 "Upon winning the election, Meir Ya'ari quickly started looking for partners, what he found was Yisrael Galili and his Ahdut Ha'Avodah party. Both share a disdain for Ben-Gurion and both share a socialist common cause. Both men quickly agreed to form a government together for the cause of socialism."
 israel.77.d:0 "The government has presented its economic plan up to 1959, the "Four Year Plan" to build up and develop the land of Israel. This plan took inspiration from Soviet style "build-up" economies. The plan is quickly gaining critics who say that it is doomed to fail."
 israel.78.d:0 "Some of the fiercest critics of the Four Year Plan are the capitalist General Zionists and Progressives who call the plan "oppressive to business owners" and say that it will only "damage Israel" and call for the plan to be cancelled."
 israel.79.d:0 "Mapai has also joined the critic camp as they said that the plan is "too authoritarian" and "undemocratic", they also stated that the plan will "lead Israel into the abyss"."
 israel.80.d:0 "Foreign Minister Yisrael Galili has announced that he will be visiting the USSR to improve relations between the two countries. Many other parties are worried that this is the first sign of a "soviet Israel". Herut has called Galili a traitor and said that he will "usher the doom of Israel, Zionism and the Jewish people." Not many people are outraged yet but many are still worried that the visit is setting a precedent for the future."
 israel.81.d:0 "the Histadrut's Mapam affiliated leadership is facing challenges from Mapam affiliated factions. It now appears that Mapam allied factions will seize the leadership from Mapai. A victory on the Histadrut front would help cement Mapam's position as the prime socialist party."
 israel.82.d:0 "A question that has been brought up during government formation, invite Maki or not? Inviting the Communist, Anti-Zionist and binationalist party would do a lot to upset every other major party but if we don't invite them our government would have an ever thinner majority in the Knesset under the risk of falling. Should we invite Maki or not?"
 israel.83.d:0 "Upon inviting Maki into our governmental coalition, Mapai was soon to file a motion of no confidence in our government, citing a "betrayal of Zionist values Israel was founded on". While the vote was immensely close, we have sneaked our way out of harm's way and the motion failed."
 israel.84.d:0 "Foreign Minister Yisrael Galili has announced a policy where Israel would move towards the Third World and neutrality. Mapai, the General Zionists, Herut and the Progressive say that we are moving away from our only major ally, the United States and that move would doom Israel. Nevertheless, our policy is continuing."
 israel.85.d:0 "In accordance to our socialist, egalitarian beliefs, we have decided to decriminalize homosexuality, this outraged the religious parties such as Mafdal and the United Torah Front who say that the move is "Unjewish" and will make Israel a "Decadent nation"."
 israel.86.d:0 "The new bill that secularizes Shabbat and makes it a secular "Day of Rest" has barely passed a Knesset vote today, much to the outrage of the already hostile religious and traditionalist parties. Whose supporters are getting increasingly resentful to our government's secular policies."
 israel.87.d:0 "Religious and Ultra-Orthodox Jews have begun to protest all over the country today, demanding that we keep Israel a "Jewish state" and stop all "communist blabber", we have decided not to use the police as to not escalate the situation even more, but Ya'ari has decided to soldier on with his policies."
 israel.88.d:0 "Mafdal has issued today a motion of no confidence following the protests saying that we have betrayed "Jewish values and the trust of the people", this motion again failed but it shows weakening support in the government."
 israel.89.d:0 "Yugoslavia has invited us today to start a conference in hopes of solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a peaceful manner. Foreign Minister Galili headed the Israeli delegation and started negotiating with the Palestinian and Arab delegations for a possible end to the conflict."
 israel.90.d:0 "Israel and Arab nations as well as the Palestinian delegation have signed today the Belgrade Accords, which promise that Israel will transform into a binational, secular state by 1965. This spurred outrage out of every opposition party in the Knesset saying that Mapam is leading Israel to doom."
 israel.91.d:0 "Herut, Mapai, the General Zionists, the Progressive Party, Mafdal and the United Torah Front have put forward a motion of no confidence today as a last ditch effort to take down the government, this motion failed to pass by 2 votes. While it is a small victory for Mapam, it is very worrying prospect regarding the government's future."
 israel.92.d:0 "Clashes between Jews and Arabs in Israel and the West Bank spiked today following the Belgrade Accords, as well as the Arab powers weak promises to support the Accords have led for confidence in the accords to drop to new lows. Many now believe that the effort to create a binational state is dead in the water due to lack of public support and even Ya'ari is starting to believe that."
 israel.93.d:0 "Approval ratings for Ya'ari have dropped as well, getting to as low as 10% approval rating. With the coalition growing ever more shaky, Ya'ari is contemplating calling an early election and seeing what happens."
 israel.94.d:0 "Ya'ari, succumbing to public and internal pressure, has decided to call for early elections this year, deciding to take the decision making back to the people. The election may well be a referendum about the Belgrade Accords where Mapam is likely to fail."
 israel.95.d:0 "After winning the election, Begin started searching out for potential allies, he talked with the leader of the General Zionists, Israel Rokach in a "long, productive conversation" which advances his goals of creating a majority coalition."
 israel.96.d:0 "Today Herut and the General Zionists have reached an agreement that will make the General Zionists support the Herut government in turn for Herut to put Israel Rokach as Minister of Finance and Peretz Bernstein as Minister of Industry. Begin calls this agreement a "step forward to creating a regime free of socialism". After getting the Progressives, Mafdal and the United Torah Front to join his coalition, Begin presented the government to the President who approved its formation."
 israel.97.d:0 "Begin has presented his "Monopoly Manifesto" today, detailing the plan to combat corporate monopolies and trade union monopolies alike, this was met in the Histadrut with alarm who very well know his intentions in weakening their power."
 israel.98.d:0 "Presented by Herut and the General Zionists, the Trade Union Act of 1956 will severely limit trade union powers and lower the Histadrut's influence on the nation. Begin has proclaimed this as the "end of the socialist era"."
 israel.99.d:0 "the Histadrut hasn't reacted to the Trade Union act kindly, it has expressed its outrage and has stated that it'll do whatever possible to "fight the oppressive laws"."
 israel.100.d:0 "Terrible news, the Histadrut has called workers from Tel Aviv to Haifa to Be'ersheba to Jerusalem to strike over the summer of 1956 to show the the Begin government the "power and unity of the labor movement", currently the Begin government has taken a passive approach in fear of further escalating the situation."
 israel.101.d:0 "Mapai and Mapam have issued a motion of no confidence in the government in light of the labor protests citing a "severe betrayal of the people by the Begin administration". This motion failed to pass but it shows that the government's passive approach isn't working."
 israel.102.d:0 "Socialist protesters affiliated with the Histadrut have decided to march to the Knesset today to "stick it to Begin". Begin has issued no response and many people show his undying resolve as either a sign of stubbornness or a sign of strength."
 israel.103.d:0 "Herut activists and socialist protesters have clashed in a riot in Tel Aviv. The clash got so bad that the police had to be involved to disperse the rioters. Nobody died but 45 people got injured. Many call Begin to act to stop the violence."
 israel.104.d:0 "Begin has decided to act and has delivered a radio speech on Kol Israel today. "Fellow citizens, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let nobody deny the perils of our time." he started. "While we battle one another, divided by petty strife of our common history, the tide of greater conflict is turning against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished." he added, "It is time for us as Jews, as citizens and as individuals to set aside our longstanding feuds and unite. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, ad we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood. The Mapai regime is no more. Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation wrought by the Arab powers is self-evident. We have seen our homes and communities destroyed by Syrian artillery fire. We have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones murdered by the Palestinian Fedayeen. Terrible and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our times. The time has come my fellow Israelis to rally around the flag, in Unity lies strength, already many realized this and have flocked to our united banner, so come fellow citizens, Unite! Unite, for we shall win through, no matter the cost!"
 israel.105.d:0 "Supporters of Herut, many of them of Mizrachi origins have organized a "parade of love" for the Prime Minister. Their supporters call this an "improvement over the recent protests" and their detractors call them "mindless automatons". Begin has called the parade "Magnificent"."
 israel.106.d:0 "Begin has presented his plan to develop the Periphery and bring it on par with the core cities. "the Periphery has been ignored for long enough, we will develop it and make it into a shining exemplar of Zionist resolve." Begin said in a Knesset speech."
 israel.107.d:0 "David Ben-Gurion has spoke out against Begin. Calling him "a fascistic figure in our ranks" and the "bringer of Israel's doom". Begin dismissed those allegations reportedly calling Ben-Gurion "senile"."
 israel.108.d:0 "Egyptian forces have been defeated in a quick operation by the IDF after harassing border patrols for the last 2 weeks. This is seen as a big victory for Herut's militaristic government."
 israel.109.d:0 "Begin has presented his \"vision for a sovereign Israel\" which shows Israel controlling not only the West Bank, but also Gaza and the other bank of the Jordan. This vision also doubted the legitimacy of the Kingdom of Jordan which spurred outrage from the Jordanian monarchy."
 israel.110.d:0 "Syrians have started an artillery barrage up from the Golan Heights today, killing 3 and injuring 50. Begin has proclaimed that the Syrians will pay for that act of aggression but has refused to elaborate how to do so."
 israel.111.d:0 "The number of recorded clashes with Fedayeen insurgents has increased in the last 2 months, raising public anxiety over safety. Begin has said in a speech that he will \"whack all of the Fedayeen terrorists\" and that \"Israel would be a secure nation, no terrorist will get in\". Begin is contemplating calling an early election to capitalize on his party's pro-safety stances."
 israel.112.d:0 "Begin has called for an early election today, hoping to capitalize on his party's pro-security and militarist stances due to the increase in Fedayeen attacks. Mapai and the General Zionists hope to win the leadership role while campaigning on stopping Begin's \"extremist\" and \"divisive\" policies."
 israel.113.d:0 "the two religious Zionist parties, Mizrachi, and their more labor based twin, HaPoel HaMizrachi (literally the Mizrachi Worker) have decided to finalize their unification under one party after running together in the 1955 election under the name "National Religious Front". The name of the new party will be called \"National Religious Party\" or \"Mafdal\" for short and will continue to represent Religious Zionism in the Knesset."
 israel.114.d:0 "The Ultra-Orthodox Agudat Yisrael party and their labor based twin, Poalei Agudat Yisrael (literally Workers of Agudat Yisrael) have decided to run together under one list named \"Religious Torah Front\". The new list will continue to represent Ultra-Orthodox interests in the Knesset."
 israel.115.d:0 "It is a known fact that Egypt may be involved with Fedayeen attacks but only recently has the government has uncovered the full extent of their involvement. A few days ago, a Fedayeen militant who murdered a civilian in Rehovot was caught and a document was found on him which linked him to Egyptian military intelligence. The government has decided to act decisively to weaken the Fedayeen and their Egyptian sponsors by raiding an important Fedayeen base in Egyptian controlled Gaza. 150 Paratroops led by Aharon Davidi and Danny Matt attacked the Egyptian base near Gaza city and have successfully ambushed an Egyptian military relief convoy. In total, about 38 Egyptians were killed in action while 8 Israelis were killed. A major humiliation for Egypt which reacted by blockading the Straits of Aqaba to Israeli sea and air traffic."
 israel.116.d_1:0 "Today the police arrived to a town with a majority Olim population, Wadi Salib. They arrived to stop a melee that was taking place in a Café in town instigated by a town resident named Akiva Ya'akov Elkarif, a man of North African origins who was under the influence of Alcohol during that day. Nobody knows what happened next but the police shot Elkarif in the leg. Rumors started to spread among Mizrachi Olim (mostly of Middle Eastern and North African descent) that the Police killed Elkarif and have gathered near the town's police station and began to protest and riot claiming that the police were ethnically discriminating against them. Rioters also looted Mapai and Histadrut clubs after claiming that the Mapai government discriminated against them."
 israel.116.d_2:0 "Today the police arrived to a town with a majority Olim population, Wadi Salib. They arrived to stop a melee that was taking place in a Café in town instigated by a town resident named Akiva Ya'akov Elkarif, a man of North African origins who was under the influence of Alcohol during that day. Nobody knows what happened next but the police shot Elkarif in the leg. Rumors started to spread among Mizrachi Olim (mostly of Middle Eastern and North African descent) that the police beaten Elkarif to death and have started to violently riot in front of the town's police station over claims of racial discrimination by the police. After looting and pillaging the Wadi Salib police station, the rioters started to loot and destroy Mapai and Histadrut clubs claiming that Mapai is a \"racist Ashkenazi organization\" and alleging it of also discriminating against them."
 israel.117.d:0 "Following its victory in the 1955 election, Mapai has formed another government led by it. Mapai has remained a major and influential party since pre-Independence times and the formation of this government signals the continuation of Mapai dominance."
 israel.118.d:0 "A new Menorah Sculpture, created by Jewish sculptor Beno Elkan, was presented to the Knesset by the Jewish community of England today. Signaling the continuation of good relations between Israel and the diaspora."
 israel.119.d:0 "Today, Herut and Agudat Yisrael have raised a motion of no confidence, following a decision by the government to open the Industrial Exposition in Haifa on Shabbat. This greatly upset the ultra-orthodox Agudat Yisrael and also provided an opportunity for Herut to blame Mapai on yet another thing. The motion failed, which shows Mapai's remaining strength in the government."
 israel.120.d:0 "The current building that hosts the Knesset wasn't entirely built for that purpose, so the idea of constructing a new building to house the Knesset was proposed to the government. The government decided to hold a public competition to determine the design which the new Knesset building would be modelled after."
 israel.121.d:0 "Today the Prime Minister has released statements regarding recognition to discrimination against Egyptian Jews by the governments of Egypt. This was probably made due to the already bad relations between Israel and Egypt."
 israel.122.d:0 "The Prime Minister has said today in a statement that the Kfar Qasim massacre was a \"a horrifying atrocity that has occurred amongst us\". And called for all involved parties to avoid such an escalation from happening ever again."
 israel.123.d:0 "Herut has raised a motion of no confidence due to our decision to withdraw from the Sinai per UN decision. They called it \"national tragic news\" and believe that we should have stayed in and later annexed the Sinai peninsula. The motion obviously failed though, so not many worries were raised."
 israel.124.d:0 "The judiciary board of architects' competition has unanimously selected Joseph Klarwin to design the new Knesset building. The new design is told to be more modern than ever."
 israel.125.d:0 "A mentally ill man has managed to sneak into the Knesset building and thrown a grenade into the plenum allegedly with the intention of killing the Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister has managed to escape with only minor wounds, the minister for religious affairs Haim Moshe-Shapira has suffered heavier wounds from the shrapnel. In the aftermath of this incident, the Prime Minister has decided to form a unit that will keep security in and around the Knesset building. The Knesset Guards will keep this incident from repeating."
 israel.126.d:0 "Right around now Israel turns 10 years old. A decade since the formation of the first Jewish state in 2000 years. Both the government and the people celebrated in the streets and in their homes and joy has reached every corner of every street of every city all around the country."
 israel.127.d:0 "A number of Mafdal ministers have resigned from the government over a debate over \"Who's a Jew\" which spinned out of control thus making them resign. This formed a rift in the government as Mafdal is on the verge of leaving the coalition and putting the overall coalition in danger."
 israel.128.d:0 "Construction for the new Knesset building in Jerusalem have begun today. The new building will be bigger and better than any other governmental building we have so far and will be the pinnacle of Israeli engineering."
 israel.129.d:0 "A panic has started tonight after a popular radio program on Kol Israel was interrupted by military code words signaling a mobilization of reservists indicating a state of national emergency. The drill threw the public into a panic as many have thought that a true national emergency is in effect and that the country is under attack. Even Queen Elisabeth of Belgium was in Israel when the crisis happened which thrown her along with other foreign delegates in the country into mass confusion thinking that they have been caught up in another war. Just on 11PM, two hours after the start of the call up, Kol Israel announced that it was just a drill. The press called the night the "Night of the Ducks" as one of the code words used was \"Water Ducks\"."
 israel.130.d:0 "Today a number of different parties issued yet another motion of no confidence citing pure management of the \"Night of the Ducks\" which thrown the public into a panic. The vote failed but it represents the government's weakening hold as election day is coming nearer."
 israel.131.d:0 "The Prime Minister has decided to call for an election in November of this year, hoping to capitalize on disorganization in the opposition and seize another victory for Mapai."
 israel.132.d:0 "The Army has ordered all Arab villages near the Jordanian border to be placed under curfew from 5 PM to 6 AM. In a village called Kafr Qasim or Kfar Qasim. The local border police battalion was ordered to \"shoot on sight\" anyone who violated the curfew. Then a truck with 28 passengers entered the village and the border police controversially opened fire on them killing several. Many other wounded villagers were left unattended. The ban on reporting on military actions imposed by the government has prevented the press from covering the event until two Maki MKs, Meir Vilner and Tawfik Toubi arrived at the village and lobbied the government to start an investigation. The government has said that the incident should not be repeated again and that an internal inquiry was underway, as well as the end on the ban on the press from covering the event."
 israel.133.d:0 "With the defeat of Herut, the United Religious Front has dissolved into two parties, HaPoel HaMizrachi and Mizrachi formed Mafdal (National Religious Party), and Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael formed the Religious Torah Front."
 idea_ISR_German_Reparations:0 "German Reparations"
 mapai.1.d:0 "\"The old way has obviously failed the Mapai workers movement\", said the newly minted Mapai chairman Moshe Sharett, former Foreign Affairs Minister, Sharett, who has taken over Mapai from David Ben-Gurion has embarked on an effort to restructure Mapai's image from the ground up. No longer it is the party of out of touch old-timers, now Mapai is the party of workers and \"all\" workers, Ashkenazi, Mizrachi, Sephardi, Yemeni, etc. Mapai is now the party modern socialism and social democracy, "New Mapai" is now a modern party for the 1950s and no longer a party of the 1920s."
 mapai.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Sharett is not known for decisive actions like his predecessor Ben-Gurion, Sharett is rather the complete opposite, a diplomatic, compromising and pragmatic Prime Minister who seeks to use the pen to achieve his goals. This approach, while adored by Sharett, has allowed his cabinet to run amok managing the affairs of state with ministers de-facto acting on their own without interference from the Prime Minister, but for now it isn't causing any real damage. This pragmatic approach, while great for coalitional cohesion as it allows decentralized governance, damages the power of the executive branch and sets the precedent of a weak Prime Ministerial office."
 mapai.3.d:0 "Moshe Sharett, who holds the office of Foreign Affairs Minister in addition to his Prime Ministerial office, is no stranger to negotiating with others. Often known as "The Negotiator" by his peers, Moshe Sharett has managed to maintain an impressively stable coalition, ranging from his own Mapai, still recovering from its own upheaval, to the liberal middle class General Zionists and the Religious Zionists. Moshe Sharett is inventing a new take on "the statesman" Prime Minister."
 mapai.4.d:0 "Prevalent Mapainiks still aligned with the now out of power David Ben-Gurion have attacked Moshe Sharett for his \"cowardly\" administration. \"If he can't administer his cabinet, how in hell can he administer the country?\", Ben-Gurion has said in an interview. While Ben-Gurion has officially retired from politics after his ousting by Sharett, he couldn't miss an opportunity to lash out against his rival."
 mapai.5.d:0 "Since the formation of the government, Golda Meir, the 'Iron Lady' has held the position of Minister of Defense but has now delivered a letter announcing her intention to retire from said position to focus more on her position as Minister of the Interior. Sharett now faces two candidates for Minister of Defense, the scheming but capable Pinhas Lavon or the reliable but cautious Levi Eshkol."
 mapai.6.d:0 "Moshe Sharett has left for the United States for an official state visit. His intentions are to meet the US President to warm up relations between Israel and America, while making America a solid ally for Israel in the future. After 2 hours of walking at Camp David with the US President. Sharett has reached an agreement where the US will support Israel in return for Israel to pledge to "not endanger stability in the Middle East"."
 mapai.7.d:0 "Pinhas Lavon, the Minister of Defense has gotten himself into a spat with a livid Moshe Sharett after the latter learned about an incident in the Egyptian border that saw 1 IDF soldier killed and 3 others wounded. Apparently the Egyptian Army launched a mortar after an Israeli drill launched a mortar into their territory and responded in kind. Sharett has sent a letter to Egypt to inform them of no ill-wills in hopes of resolving the situation before it escalates."
 mapai.8.d:0 "Newly minted Chairwoman of Mapai, Golda Meir has started a media campaign today to portray herself as the infallible "Stateswoman" who is the most qualified to be Prime Minister. With her ability to keep her party under her control she has managed to make herself out to be a resilient and formidable politician who should not be crossed."
 mapai.9.d:0 "Now as PM, Golda Meir's conduct in her position has been called out to be similar to her predecessor Ben-Gurion's. An aggressive decision heavy administration with a powerful office of Prime Minister has been called by the press as a "new kind of old". For now a powerful executive ensures that the Prime Minister remains an influential position in the affairs of state."
 mapai.10.d:0 "In a bold move, Golda Meir has decided to let the General Zionists leave her governing coalition in a bid to get the more reliable Progressives in. While the majority is maintained, a major party now sits in opposition, but now the Coalition will squabble less, or so Golda Meir hopes."
 mapai.11.d:0 "Golda Meir has always kept a hotline to Sde Boker, the far away southern kibbutz where former Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion has made his home. She exchanges letters with him when even she's not sure about the next course of action in hopes of hearing the old man's advice."
 mapai.12.d:0 "A general impression of Golda Meir's Premiership is that of the "Iron Lady", a decisive Prime Minister who rules her coalition with an iron first and the entire country with a velvet glove. While this increases tensions in the coalition, she makes sure that her office is not to be trifled with."
 mapai.13.d:0 "Calling for an end in factionalism within Mapai, Levi Eshkol has branded himself as the candidate of party and national unity. Putting state above petty affairs, Levi Eshkol has started a media blitz to show himself as a gentle, kind and honest statesman who can succeed Ben-Gurion."
 mapai.14.d:0 "A bystander may see Levi Eshkol's premiership as just standing around doing nothing, but his cabinet will say otherwise. Taking advice from his colleague Moshe Sharret, Levi Eshkol has taken a semi-pragmatic approach to governance while maintaining the office of Prime Minister as an influential position. Levi Eshkol is trying to find the middle ground for the best kind of governance."
 mapai.15.d:0 "Levi Eshkol has resolved a minor incident inside his coalition today by exchanging a few Cabinet portfolios between the General Zionists and the Religious Zionists while promising to pursue goals issued by both parties, such as empowering the middle class and "Keeping Shabbat integrity". While people may say that compromise just leaves both parties unsatisfied, Levi Eshkol has managed to maintain a stable coalition so far."
 mapai.16.d:0 "It is no secret that Levi Eshkol is David Ben-Gurion's close friend, Levi Eshkol has often exchanged letters with his friend regarding the affairs of state, asking for his advice on the matter. Perhaps two brains working together may create a more successful administration."
 mapai.17.d:0 "Eshkol has prepared to air a rather mundane New Jewish Year Speech to be aired on radios via Kol Israel. But alas, while reading his speech, he stumbled and stuttered, not very statesmanlike. His aides are urging him to reread the speech but Eshkol takes it as an insult for his oratorical abilities."
 mapai.18.d:0 "Eshkol has decided to cancel his New Year speech rather than spend the entire night wasting precious time doing retakes of the speech. Come New Year eve and citizens are tuning in to Kol Israel only to discover that the usual songs play instead of the scheduled speech. Some sent letters to the Prime Minister's office asking what happened to the speech."
 mapai.19.d:0 ""I... wish all citizens of the State of.. Israel! Jewish, Arab, Druze and many others, a happy new year!" Levi Eshkol's "stuttering speech" has become an instant hit as the facade of the infallible Prime Minister seems to disappear for the moment with his down to earth and rather "human" speech. People are praising his honesty and adore their Prime Minister as the "People's Prime Minister"."
 mapai.20.d:0 "With Pinhas Lavon being sworn in as Prime Minister, many stop to think how his premiership may look like, he seems like he is determined to implement most of Mapai's more divisive points,but is known to resort to underhanded tactics to secure their passage. So far other parties do their best to be on his good side so Lavon never had much of a challenge forming a coalition."
 mapai.21.d:0 "Lavon, as one of his first orders of business, came up with a law to strengthen the Histadrut, but figured that he wouldn't be able to pass it without the support of Mapam and Meir Ya'ari, so he agreed to a quid pro quo deal with Ya'ari to introduce the Histadrut law first, and after Mapam helps it pass, he would introduce another bill barring the Histadrut from supporting any political party. The first bill passed easily enough but after introducing the second Mapam backed bill, he secretly ordered all Mapai MKs to vote against that bill, dooming it to fail on the floor of the Knesset. This outraged Meir Ya'ari who was seen shouting and squabbling with Lavon following the vote."
 mapai.22.d:0 "A frequent point of contention between Mapai and its usual coalition partners the ultra orthodox was the status of education, Lavon sought to reach a conclusive deal that would favor Mapai's position, so he introduced a bill to build secular schools near ultra orthodox communities but also promised to pass a bill to strengthen the Chief Rabbinate. After passing the first deal, much to the ire of the Ultra Orthodox, Lavon decided to mull the second bill, which led to the outraged ultra-orthodox to withdraw from the government but Lavon got a number of rogue Mapam MKs to prop up his government from the outside in the meantime, keeping his majority support in the Knesset."
 mapai.23.d:0 "All of Lavon's tricks seem to be catching up to him, with Menachem Begin, Meir Ya'ari and Yitzhak Meir-Levin introducing a no-confidence vote, after a tense vote and desperate negotiations, Lavon got the rogue Mapam MKs, General Zionists and Progressive Party and Mafdal to vote for him, barely saving his government from collapsing."

israel.religiousdebate.d:0 "In our efforts to reconcile the 2 religious factions, we have decided it would be beneficial to have the leaders of both the Hareidim and Hilonim sit down and have a civilized discussion over the issues that divide them. If all goes to plan, they will be able to work things out and we can make a satisfactory compromise for all. However, if we stand on the wrong side of too many issues or they can't bring themselves to agree, we could be left worse off than we started."
debate.1.d:0 "The subject up for discussion is how much the government should get involved in the Kosher food certification process. The Hiloni leaders are insisting that there be no federal interference at all, while the Hareidi leaders demand that all businesses keep Kosher. The middle ground argument here would be to establish a committee to oversee the Kosher process, making it easier for companies to have Kosher certification and for us to keep track of non-Kosher foods, but we can go any way."
debate.2.d:0 "The next topic of the talks is the question of Shabbat, and as expected, both sides are trying to hold on to their previous positions, the Hilonim saying that Shabbat should be altogether ignored and the Hareidim saying it should be mandated. The logical path here is to stay above the fray and just let everyone do as he or she sees fit- Why should the government force anyone to have a religion they don't want?"
debate.3.d:0 "The third and final, as well as most divisive issue at hand, is that of exemptions from IDF service for Hareidi students involved in post-high school Torah learning. The Hilonim have already made their disgust with such exemptions clear, and the Hareidim are warning of divine punishment if we take these scholars away from their source of life. We could try to compromise and issue deferrals, as opposed to absolute immunity, in addition with more limited exemptions, or side with one of the factions on the issue."
debate.4.d:0 "The debates between the Hareidim and Hilonim have concluded, with various resolutions being made on the 3 items discussed during the talks. The fallout from the debate is still unclear, and whether it will have a positive or negative impact on our country remains to be seen. We can only hope we made the right decisions."

Even more ominous, however, is the thought that if Nasser further aligns with the Soviets, as suspected, the Reds will control the flow of oil from the Middle East to the entirety of the Western World."
 suez.2.d:0 "As of a few hours ago, our soldiers have entered the Suez Canal Zone and have rightfully seized it, ousting the Imperialists from it once and for all! Following their entry, the government quickly declared the nationalization of the Suez Canal, creating a great moment and greater victory for us and the whole Arab World. The English, as expected, are furious, but they aren't going to be able to get past the UN and the rest of the world unless they decide to do something really crazy."
 suez.3.d:0 "Our fears over the fate of the Suez Canal have been realized, as Egypt has seized and nationalized the Suez Canal. This is an unprecedented danger to our economy and international prestige, and we have to act."
 suez.4.d:0 "Egypt has outrageously nationalized the Suez Canal, putting our trade routes in severe danger. We are not alone in the panic as the British are suffering the brunt of the blow. Between Nasser funding and arming our opposition in Algeria and now this unprecedented, brazen, slap to our face, we must work with the British to ensure Nasser will never harm or insult us again."
 suez.5.d:0 "When Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, they simultaneously blockaded the Straits of Tiran, south of the Red Sea, cutting off the port of Eilat and with it our access to much of our imports- oil or otherwise. This is going to kill our economy and starve our citizens, and we can't let this go quietly. Something has to be done."
 suez.6.d:0 "The US, fearing an escalation of the situation, hosted an international conference in order to solve the crisis. However, all of the parties involved stood their ground in regards to ownership of the canal, with no side seeming willing to buckle or compromise. Despite the high hopes the Americans had for the talks going in, it is clear they have utterly failed, with no agreement or decision being made as to who will get the Canal."
 suez.7.d:0 "Gamel Abdel Nasser has presented us with quite the dilemma by nationalizing the Suez Canal, formerly of our control. We now have to calculate whether or not it is in our best interests to take military action against Egypt, or to let one tiny piece of the Empire go. If we do decide to respond in force, we will surely need to act together with another power, such as the French, so as not to look too much like colonialist overlords cracking down on their upstart subjects."
 suez.8.d:0 "The British prime minister recently contacted our own leader to discuss military action against Egypt in response to Nasser's seizing of the Suez Canal. It seems like a reasonable proposal, and if we are successful in whatever option we choose, it may force Nasser to cease funding the Algerian rebels which have been plaguing us for so long."
 suez.9.d:0 "The British and French have both sent messages to our leadership indicating a desire to strike back against Nasser for his recent actions involving the Suez Canal. This seems almost too good of an opportunity to pass up- we can humble one of our most dangerous enemies, seize glory for ourselves, and create strong ties of friendship between us and two great European powers. The only question is, will we take it?"
 suez.10.d:0 "Our prime minister and top army officials have gathered together with their French and British counterparts in the small town of Sevres to discuss our military plans for the war with Egypt and political options in the event of success. We have already suggested conquering all of Egypt but that was quickly rejected. Instead, we have decided on a smaller operation, codename 'Kadesh', that aims to destroy all Egyptian presences in the Sinai in under 2 weeks. While ambitious, we believe we will succeed splendidly."
 suez.11.d:0 "In a secret meeting with British and Israeli leaders and generals, it has been decided that Israel will advance through the Sinai with air support from us and the RAF, while our airborne units will carry out a joint operation with the British to retake the canal, Port Said, and Port Faud. The jump, called Operation Telescope, will be preceded by a bombing campaign codenamed Musketeer (revised)."
 suez.12.d:0 "In a secret meeting with French and Israeli leaders and generals at the remote town of Sevres, it has been decided that Israel will advance through the Sinai with air support from the RAF and the French, while our airborne units will carry out a joint operation with the French to retake the canal, Port Said, and Port Faud. The jump, called Operation Telescope, will be preceded by a bombing campaign codenamed Musketeer (revised)."

 suez.13.d:0 "The time for peace has passed, and our Bombers and Troop Transports are heading for Suez momentarily. The plan is to strike key military and infrastructure targets in and around Suez, following which our men will land on Port Said. All of our plans with the French and Israelis will soon be put to the test, and we can only hope that we succeed both militarily, and perhaps more importantly, on the floor of the UN. For even if we take back our land and secure our oil lanes, the international community might not have the same thoughts and opinions on this whole affair..."

For even if we take back our land and secure our oil lanes, the international community might not have the same thoughts and opinions on this whole affair..."
 suez.15.d:0 "Our transports have reached the drop zones and our brave airborne units are dropping momentarily. Israel is already performing its part of the operation, and although we've provided some air support, it is time for us to carry out our end of the Sevres deal and retake the canal from Nasser and his gang of thieves."
 suez.16.d:0 "Our transports have reached the drop zones and our brave airborne units are dropping momentarily. Israel is already performing its part of the operation, and although we've provided some air support, it is time for us to carry out our end of the Sevres deal and retake the canal from Nasser and his gang of thieves."
 suez.17.d:0 "Israel, as according to the Sevres plan, has invaded the Sinai and is pushing for the Suez Canal, giving the world a shock as it prepares for the looming oil shortage crisis. Knowing this, we will offer a ceasefire that Nasser will surely reject, giving us and the French reason to join the Israelis in the fight against him. "
 suez.18.d:0 "In the hours following the treacherous Zionist invasion of the Sinai, the equally repulsive imperial powers of Britain and France have proposed a ceasefire, which Israel already has accepted. It involves an immediate cessation of all hostilities, the handing over of the Canal to a UN mandated peacekeeping force, and the demilitarization of the Sinai desert. We can either reject the ceasefire and bet on the success of our armed forces, or play it safe and risk incurring the wrath of our own people and the Arab world."
 suez.19.d:0 "In a move that must've surprised the Egyptians just as much as us, Nasser has accepted the ceasefire and is handing over the Suez Canal to the UN. While our top generals and military forces are disappointed at the lost chance to prove themselves, this is clearly better for us than any military action would've been."
 suez.20.d:0 "As expected (and almost hoped), Nasser has declined our proposed ceasefire. The Israelis will keep advancing in the Sinai, and the word has been given to our bombers and airborne units to prepare to launch. Well an accepted ceasefire would've been ideal, our top generals are confident in our forces' success."
 suez.21.d:0 "As expected (and almost hoped), Nasser has declined our proposed ceasefire. The Israelis will keep advancing in the Sinai, and the word has been given to our bombers and airborne units to prepare to launch. Well an accepted ceasefire would've been ideal, our top generals are confident in our forces' success."
 suez.22.d:0 "In the space of a week, the fragile stability has been shattered by countries and leaders who we thought were our allies. Israel, Britain, and France have all declared war on Nasser's Egypt and the world is looking to us for a response. Many of our top foreign policy advisors are suggesting we strongly condemn the aggressors so as to gain the trust of the rest of the middle east, but others say it's not our fight, and others still say we need to support our allies of old."
 suez.23.d:0 "[USA.GetLeader], the President of the United States, has released an official statement declaring his and his government's intent to stay out of anything relating to the current situation in the Sinai and Suez Canal. This essentially gives us and our allies a free hand to continue the war and deal with the peace conference as we please."
 suez.24.d:0 "[USA.GetLeader], the President of the United States, has released an official statement declaring his and his government's intent to stay out of anything relating to the current situation in the Sinai and Suez Canal. This essentially gives us and our allies a free hand to continue the war and deal with the peace conference as we please. Our top policy experts are already working on favorable proposals, including the return of the Canal to our control."
 suez.25.d:0 "Due to the lack of opposition from any major world powers, and specifically the United States, we have been able to draw up a peace plan to our and our allies' liking. The details of the plan include the transfer of the Sinai to Israel, and the return of the Canal to our hands. In hindsight, this whole crisis hasn't turned out to be so bad after all."
 suez.26.d:0 "In the worst case scenario, the president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader] has issued an official statement strongly condemning our and our allies' recent actions in the Sinai and Suez Canal, going so far as to say he is considering ceasing all aid to all 3 of our countries. In addition, most of the free world has followed their lead, and even the USSR is piling on. In short, this is nothing less than a disaster."
 suez.27.d:0 "In the worst case scenario, the president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader] has issued an official statement strongly condemning our and our allies' recent actions in the Sinai and Suez Canal, going so far as to say he is considering ceasing all aid to all 3 of our countries. In addition, most of the free world has followed their lead, and even the USSR is piling on. On the homefront, people are calling for [ENG.GetLeader]'s resignation. In short, this is nothing less than an unmitigated disaster."
 suez.28.d:0 "Today, the UN concluded its discussion of the Suez Crisis, and passed 2 resolutions, 997 and 1001, that will effectively put an end to the whole situation. Combined, they give the Canal to a UN mandated Peacekeeping Force, demilitarize the Sinai, and just to add one more kick to the rear, unilaterally condemn us, the French, and the Israelis. What seemed so promising at the start of Operations Musketeer and Telescoped has morphed into our worst failure since the end of World War II."
 suez.29.d:0 "In the aftermath of UN resolutions 997 and 1001, we've examined all that's occurred in the past few months, including all our military successes, and all our political failures. While we have proved to us, our people, and Egypt that we are not a military power to be taken lightly, any countries which may have viewed us favorably post 1948 now surely treat us with suspicion and distaste. All of our international goodwill is gone, and it seems we've alienated both major powers. The next decade and perhaps even longer will present challenges unlike any we've faced before, and will determine the fate of our nation."

 suez.37.d:0 "Our Airborne Divisions have landed in and around Port Said with most of their equipment and formations intact, but the next few hours of fighting will be key. The Egyptians are gathering the forces in the area for a counterattack, and whether or not our men can hold will determine the success of Telescope and the fate of the Suez Canal. Our commanders are confident that we'll come out on top, but we know that something unexpected can happen at any time."
 suez.38.d:0 "Good news from Suez! Divisional Headquarters are reporting a smashing victory and complete control over Port Said, while the French have experienced similar success in Port Faud. Our men are rushing to seize the whole of the Canal Zone as we speak, and it is safe to say that at least from a military standpoint, Operation Telescope has been a success from start to finish."
 suez.39.d:0 "We recently asked for a situation report on Operation Telescope, and what we've received is that the worst case scenario has occurred. The Egyptians were able to rally much faster than expected, and caught our men off guard, still recovering from the initial post-drop fighting. They have completely retaken Port Said, and the French say that their units are being pushed out of Port Faud. This is bad. Really bad."
 suez.40.d:0 "Our attaches in Britain, and our scout aircraft, have both reported that the Airborne landings of Operation Telescope have failed spectacularly, and it is entirely on us to make this conflict a victory. While this obviously came as a shock, we can't afford to dwell on it for long. We have two options. The first is to admit defeat and see if some form of peace deal can be hammered out. The second is to have confidence in our armed forces and their ability to out-wit, out-fight, and out-work their Egyptian counterparts."
 suez.41.d:0 "In the aftermath of of Telescope's failure, the Israelis have compounded our defeat and international embarrassment by stating that they are willing to stop the fighting in exchange for a real, lasting peace deal. Thus, in the span of two to three days, Nasser and his army has held off both us and the French, and now defeated the Israelis. This is a disaster."
