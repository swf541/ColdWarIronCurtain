Thousands lined up on the doors of the Royal Palace, awaiting impatiently for the King's body to be taken to his grave, to the ballads echoing and the smell of incense that mark the end of an era. The memory of independence seems to have never been so fresh.And whispers of assassination spread like wildfire."

While discussing ties with the West, two men from the crowd threw three Molotov cocktails at the prince and his security. The first Molotov missed entirely, giving alertness to the two coming.

 morocco_news.1.d.his:0 "Media has reported a close attempt on the life of Crown Prince Hassan II while making a speech at the city of Rabat this afternoon. While discussing ties with the West, two men from the crowd threw three Molotov cocktails at the prince and his security. The first Molotov missed entirely, giving alertness to the two coming. One hit security while the third never even was thrown as the crowd quickly swarmed the men. Hassan II finished his speech before quickly being escorted to safety. The two men and three other accomplishes have been found and arrested.\n Crown Prince Hassan II was quick to thank the guards and his supporters in the crowd for saving his life, promising that this will not stop future events. What could of ended in a horrific murder left none injured and opposition of the regime weakening in influence."
 morocco_news.1.d.alt:0 "Devastating news of the prince’s death that has spread across Morocco has been officially confirmed by state authorities this evening. Due to his father’s declining health, Crown Prince Hassan II began to take up many of his father’s roles by the end of the decade, leading to him making more public appearances. One such appearance in the city of Rabat would be his last as he addressed the nation on improving relations with the United States and the West. After calling for friendly ties with Israel, three Molotov cocktails would be thrown into Hassan II and his security. Frontline guards would be shocked by the first Molotov, giving a gap for a second to hit Hassan directly on the head, following a third on the chest. The Prince would ignite on fire and collapse, hitting his head during the fall. He would quickly be extinguished and rushed for medical treatment as marshal law was enforced over the frenzied city. Five suspected terrorists were captured within the first hour.\n With Hassan II confirmed dead, the fate of Morocco is at a crossroads. As the current king grows ill, the need for a replacement heir has grown urgent. Next in line for succession is Hassan II’s brother Prince Moulay Abdallah, who has shown little interest in politics. Without the strong Hassan II as a replacement for Mohammad V, this may signal a grave future for the Alaouite Dynasty."

 casablanca.1.d:0 "In the sprawling port city of Casablanca within the arid deserts of Morocco, the leaders of various North African nations, such as Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, and others have decided to end their conflict and animosity between their nations and create the \"Casablanca Group\". Formed as an informal association of African nations, its sole purpose was to unite Africa under one banner, with Pan-Africanism a core tenant in its values for a new, united Africa. While the Casablanca Group is widely seen as a benevolent organization, critics point out that the organization is mostly comprising of radical, left wing leaders and their respective political parties, with viewpoints that are critical to Western rule in Africa. Nevertheless, observers believe that the organization may bring about lasting peace and prosperity in one of the most violent, most impoverished continents on the planet, but it is too early to be certain."

 morocco.5.a:0 "The UNFP has crossed the line!"
 morocco.5.d:0 "Following the recent attack on the Crown Prince, 5 suspects were captured by the police. After tense dealings with the police, they have been taken into custody of the law where further interrogation has begun. Upon a criminal investigation, four out of the five suspects had concrete evidence against them along with viable connection to the National Union of Popular Forces Party(UNFP) through a contract found in one of the men’s apartment supposedly from Fqih Basri, commanding the attack.\nThis evidence has shocked the government, unsure of how to mount a response. Decisions have been left up to the Crown Prince Hassan II who has made no decision as of now. "

In a shocking display of forgiveness, Hassan II has given amnesty to all involved.\nThe generosity of the prince has came with great public support, seeing him as a righteous future leader. Many elites worry that not enough was done to punish the opposition. "
 morocco.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]President Barka Survives Royalist Raid"
 morocco.9.d:0 "The establishment of free elections and a presidential role would come under fierce scrutiny as many royalist forces claimed this move as a direct insult to the once mighty Alaouite Dynasty, blaming Ben Barka for the \"death of Morocco\" and the \"Berber way of life\". A group comprised of elite royalists who lost many of their governmental positions have orchestrated an attempt to kill Barka and reestablish authoritarian control. Starting at 22:00, 45 Gunmen would storm the presidential palace backed by 5 AFVS turned rogue by the military. The president, his family, and his security force would manage to barely hold on till 23:00 when the military managed arrive in time to defeat the attackers, restoring order.\nWhile the president and his family remain uninjured, 31 Gunmen and 4 Security officers were killed along with 4 AFVS destroyed. An investigation has begun into the matter to determine who was involved and to what extent. As of now, the nation is in mourning for the security forces that died protecting democracy."

This shocking news has been officially announced over state television which recorded the gunfight intensely. Many prisoners remain on death row while over 30 have been executed by firing squad. "
 morocco.11.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Communists Exiled"
 morocco.11.d:0 "Following the attack, a trial was held for all those involved in the assassination plot against Ben Barka. Upon careful examination of the evidence found, the direct shooter has been sentenced to life in prison while the five others were exiled to the Soviet Union. Tensions between Morocco and the Soviet Union have only built due to this situation, marking an end to a history of positive Soviet-Moroccan relations."

 morocco.13.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Terror In Morocco!"
 morocco.13.d:0 "While on his way to work earlier today, Resident-General Augustin Guillaume of Morocco was assassinated via car bomb. When the Resident-General stepped into his car and his chauffer started it, the Citroen Traction Avant burst into flames, killing both of them and singing the leaves of the nearby flora. Samir Toufiq, a previously unknown Moroccan Nationalist, has claimed responsibility for the sudden attack, crying out for the Moroccan people to rise up against their French oppressors as he was arrested this afternoon. Toufiq’s call to action has taken hold in many Moroccans, who are now marching the streets of Rabat tonight in protest of the imperialist French government. Though this event was notably violent, it has roused the people of Morocco to take action for independence."

 morocco.10.d:0 "President Ben Barka was at a public rally when three shots were fired off at him from the crowd. All three missed, with one scathing his arm. While shocked, the rally continued onward as if nothing happened while security quickly hunted down the attacker. Quickly tracking the man, they found numerous back-and-forth letters between the Soviet Ambassador in Rabat discussing the assassination. The man has quickly been arrested, and over 6 other accomplices have been found on further investigation."
 Maghreb.1.t:0 "Maghrebi Outreach"
 Maghreb.1.d:0 "Politicians across the Maghreb have been invited to Rabat to discuss a new blossom of MaghrebI ties which at most points have been considered hostile. The proposed Arab Maghreb Union will allow for increased bilateral ties in both terms of economy and politics, bringing about closer relations and trade deals. This proposed project will be difficult at the least, bringing together nations who have been known to be at odds. While in its Beta stages, Morocco promises an increased level of prosperity and peace will enter into the North African region if the Union an be agreed upon."
