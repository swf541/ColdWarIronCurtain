nixon.1960.d:0 "President Richard Nixon took time to condemn the southern Democrats, called Dixiecrats, for their extreme segregationist stance and resistance to civil rights. The President noted these politicians have interfered with Supreme Court rulings and federal statutes across the south. The speech by the President is being praised by civil rights activists. However, opponents to the President accuse him of seeking to exploit the current situation in the South in order to rally support for the Republican Party. Supporters to the President dismiss this criticism and insist he is simply laying the framework for future civil rights legislation."
Operation_Vulture.1.d:0 "The United States military announced the initiation of combat operations against anti-French communist Viet Minh forces in French Indochina. American bombers from nearby airfields are targeting key Viet Minh strongpoints as other combat units move into the country. The United States believes the Viet Minh represents a major threat to regional security and the safety of the Vietnamese people. The French government welcomes the support and claims it will soon be able to restore security in Vietnam and reach an honorable resolution to the conflict. The global response is expected to be especially negative from post-colonial states who will see the action as the United States propping up European imperialism."
