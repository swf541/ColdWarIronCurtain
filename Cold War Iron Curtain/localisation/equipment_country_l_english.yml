Its design drew upon half-tracks imported from France in the 1930s, employing standard components supplied by U.S. truck manufacturers to speed production and reduce costs. The concept was designed, and the pilot models manufactured by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (before the prototype was officially labeled M2.). Production by the White Motor Company began in 1940 and was expanded to include Autocar."

Derived from the M2 half-track car, the M3 was extensively produced, with about 15,000 standard M3s and more than 38,000 variant units manufactured. In the Cold War era, the vehicle was used by a variety of state and non-state operators in conflicts in South America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, remaining in service until as late as the mid-1990s. In Mexico they are still in use as of 2019."

It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

The M24 has 38mm of armor and a 75mm main gun. The engine is a V8 twin Cadillac with a Hydramatic transmission that can move roughly the same as the M5 Stuart. In combat, the M5 Stuart's small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign. It was short after this that the M24 Chaffee was developed with the intention of giving it more firepower to better serve its role."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

 USA_ht_equipment_3_short:0 "T32"
 USA_ht_equipment_3_desc:0 "Work began in early 1945 to develop a significantly heavier variant of the M26 Pershing. Using data collected from the T29 Heavy Tank project and incorporating an experimental 90mm main gun firing armor-piercing, composite rigid ammunition as well as a more advanced transmission, the first T32 tank was produced. The T15E2 gun mounted on this tank was much more powerful than the gun mounted on the Pershing, and similar to the T26E4 Super Pershing which utilized a similar experimental 90mm, the counterweight at the back of the turret was enlarged substantially to offset the long gun's weight."

It replaced the M103's engine with an AVDS1790-2 V12 twin turbocharged engine, granting it significant advantages over the M103. The improved engine could carry it 295 miles at 23 mph and had significant mobility using the same fuel as the M103. There were also some minor other improvements made to the parts of the M103 such as a slightly different model of transmission but was ultimately the same. The M103A2 was the last heavy tank created by the US because main battle tanks supplanted the need for heavy tanks and could carry more firepower with less weight and more mobility."

It weighs 95 tons and is 36x14x9 ft large needing a crew of 4 individuals. The armor is 1ft thick in every part and used a GAF V-8 engine. The tank uses 2 tracks and a horizontal volute spring suspension. The T95 is equipped with a 105mm main gun and has a M2 Browning secondary armament. It was initially designed to break through German defenses and was later considered for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. Production was already planned but the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs ended the war and the project was cancelled before a unit could be manufactured."

 USA_sht_equipment_3_desc:0 "The R32 is an experimental nuclear superheavy tank designed by Chrysler in the 50s. The R32 never reached prototype phase but some parts were manufactured. The R32 was designed to carry a nuclear powered electric engine and a 120mm main gun with 3 secondary MGs. The nuclear engine was estimated to give it a speed of 40 mph and an almost limitless travelling range as a result of nuclear power being its source of fuel. The armor was designed to be 127-254mm thick. The project was cancelled quickly after its inception due to a large number of hangups in the lack of technology needed to create the design and skepticism on behalf of the US General Staff in charge of funding the project."

The Sherman can wield a 75mm, 76mm or 105mm main gun and typically had a browning secondary gun. It is propelled by a C4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine capable of transporting the vehicle at 22-30 mph over 100-150 miles before needing refueling. It was reliable, cheap to produce, and a logician's wet dream. It was very compact and easy to transport in large numbers which made shipping the vehicle across the Atlantic extremely easy. The M4 was also very versatile and was capable of operating in a large variety of conditions."

 USA_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M26 Pershing is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1944. It saw combat in WWII and in the Korean war. The M26 Pershing is notably heavy for a medium tank with an exceptionally poor off-road speed as a result of this. Its 8-cylinder Ford GAF engine could carry it up to 100 miles at 30 mph on road but off-road it clocks at 5.25 mph. Its main gun is a 90mm cannon and can wield a M2 browning. However, during the Korean war the .50 caliber M2 browning was swapped for 2 M1919 .30-06 guns due to the large quantity of soft targets in the field and the need to carry 9x the ammunition rather than more firepower. The M26 may have been a medium tank, but it is extremely heavy and can be considered to be a hybrid medium/heavy tank."

 USA_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M46 Patton is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1949. It saw combat in the Korean War and was designed to replace the M26 Pershing due to its inordinate weight. It features a 90mm main gun and 102mm armor. It can be equipped with a single M2 Browning or dual M1919 Brownings. The M46 Patton uses a V12 twin-turbo engine that clocks up to 15-30 mph and has an operational range of 30-80 miles. It was heavily mass produced in an attempt to replace the former designs. It was in date with modern designs and weapons and did not suffer from heavy weight."

The engine is an optimized variant of the V12 used in prior Patton tanks with a light fuel injection system and is supercharged. It has an operation range off-road of 160 miles and 300 miles on-road. It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

It has approximately 220mm of armor and carries a 105mm main gun. It typically used the M73 7.62x51mm machine gun as its secondary armament. The engine is an improved V12 twin-turbo engine that can move about the same speed as the M48. However, despite weighing slightly more than the M48, the M60 can move about the same speed and across the same difference. The M60 underwent many different minor changes throughout its life and has approximately 4 variants as a result of this. This meant increases in the armor, the weight and improvements to reliability."

The M1 uses composite 350mm armor. Its primary cannon is a 105mm main gun with either 1 .50 caliber or 2 .7.62 caliber secondary guns. The engine is a multi-fuel turbine engine and it can move at 45 mph on and 30 mph offroad. It has an operational range of about 265 miles on or 200 miles off road. It doesn't use the MBT70's suspension but instead torsion bar suspension with shock absorbers. It has demonstrated considerable effectivity in every US conflict since its inception. The M1 Abrams has become iconic due to its considerable toughness, mobility, and firepower. A lot of its improvements come from lessons learned from the MBT-70 project where useful features were kept but more troublesome ones were abandoned."

 SOV_lt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-60"
 SOV_lt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T60 was a light tank manufactured to replace the T-38 in its recon role. It was designed in 1941 by Nicholas Astrov and 6,300 were produced in the 2 years it was produced.. The vehicle was a 2 crew tank with a 6 cylinder engine and reaches up to 44 km/h with a 20mm main gun. It was used extensively during WWII."
 SOV_lt_equipment_2:0 "T-70"
 SOV_lt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-70"
 SOV_lt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-70 light tank was a WWII scout tank manufactured to replace the PT60. Nicholas Astrov began work immediately after the PT60 and finished in 1942. In the 2 years it was manufactured, 8,300 were produced. The tank had a much larger 45mm gun and came with 2 GAZ-202 engines and could reach up to 45 km/h. The T-70 also had nominally improved optic capability It was used extensively during WWII."
 SOV_lt_equipment_3:0 "PT-76"
 SOV_lt_equipment_3_short:0 "PT-76"
 SOV_lt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The PT76 is a Soviet amphibious light tank and was heavily exported around the world. It was designed by N Shashmyrin and Zh Kotin in 1951 and around 12,000 units were made. It requires a 3 man crew and a V6 straight six engine with a speed of 44 km/h and can swim at 10 km/h. It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_short:0 "T-34-85"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1:0 "T-44"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-44"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-44 is a medium Soviet tank made closer to the end of WWII. It provided improved mobility and greater armor with a heavier 85mm main gun. It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2:0 "T-54"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-54"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_short:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_short:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5:0 "T-64A"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_short:0 "T-64A"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The T-64 is a Soviet MBT that introduced numerous modernizations over the T-62 and can be called a continuation of the improvements made from the T-55 to the T-62. It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6:0 "T-72"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6_short:0 "T-72"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The T-72 is a Soviet MBT created as a new generation of tanks, mostly to replace the T-62 and its expensive counterpart the T-64. It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7:0 "T-80U"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_short:0 "T-80U"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_desc:0 "The T-80 is a Soviet MBT designed following the doctrine of high mobility the T-72 set. The KMBD began designing it in 1964 and finished in 1975 after 11 years of work. The hull itself is made of improved, thickened composite armor and comes with an improved smoothbore gun. It also can come equipped with a rocket armament for improved firepower. It has a smaller range than the T-72 and slightly slower speeds despite having a more advanced transmission and gas turbine engine. It saw conflict in the Chechen wars and the war in Donbass but was not extensively used as much as the T-72 was."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8:0 "T-90"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_short:0 "T-90"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_desc:0 "After the T-80 failed to replace the T-72 or display significantly greater capabilities, Kartsev-Venediktov sought to further improve the tank and introduce better capability than the T-80. The design was finished around 1990. The engine was replaced with a 12 cylinder diesel engine and was slower than even the T-80, but held much higher firepower. The gun was upgraded, the fire control system was improved, the armor was thickened substantial and many more auxiliaries were added including a ATGM jammer and smoke dischargers. It has seen combat in Dagestan and Donbass. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_short:0 "T-84N"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_desc:0 "Work on the modernization of the T-80UD tank began in 1992. The T-84N features a new armored side skirt, a new welded turret with an automatic loader in the aft niche, new reactive armor, an auxiliary power unit (APU), a thermal imaging sight, satellite navigation, a laser rangefinder for the commander, and other improvements"

It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h.

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war.

The engine would be an optimized turbine engine, the countermeasures and armor would have been a major focus of the tank, and it would have underwent massive optimizations in its engine, transmission, suspension, and tracks in order to ensure that it could operate in rugged wilderness environments such as the Soviet Union where infrastructure is scarce and would have been ploughed up to prevent the US from using them. In essence, it would be a higher mobility, long-range, all-environment tank but would likely have less direct survivability than the M1A2 Abrams as a result of cutting corners on armor to feed into its other assets."

An unknown number of FN-49s were produced as selective fire automatic rifles, but the small 10 round box magazine limited the usefulness of the fully automatic feature."

Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan.

 VIE_manpats_1_short: "M1 Bazooka"
 VIE_manpats_1_desc: "The M1 Bazooka is a recoilless anti-tank rocket developed in 1942 by Edward Uhl. More than 400000 units were created and it saw massive usage during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. The M1 Bazooka is one of the first rocket propelled anti tank weapons. It could be used against bunkers, armored vehicles, machine gun nests, or tanks. Some copies of the M1 were captured by German forces quickly after being rolled out and they were reverse engineered to create the Panzerschreck. The M1 costs very little and overwhelming amounts of surplus ammunition were created so it was used in future wars and is still used by low-budget armies today. At its current rate of usage, the weapon will likely continue see combat by low-budget armies. However, with global development resulting in an increase in dedicated MICs and current conflicts running it out, it is not likely to see more for much longer."

It can be loaded with 66mm incendiary rockets that use TPA to ignite an area after explosion. It can burn far hotter than napalm and creates enough heat and smoke to force low flying helicopters to avoid an area. It can be used as an anti-tank weapon due to the tremendous heat it creates over a large area effectively roasting a vehicle's crew. Alternatively, the M202 can use the LAW's 66mm rockets if the operator needs it to use direct rockets rather than blanket an area in fire. It did not see official wide scale production, although several hundred of the prototype model were made and used in Vietnam. "

It uses infrared to home into its target. In 1948, the US army began seeking new air defense weapons to replace ineffective guns. Many different concepts for fast moving rockets were investigated but ultimately none were accurate. In the mid 1950s, Convair began studying the use of infrared guidance to create a portable surface to air missile system. Convair began looking at early air-to-air missiles to create their weapon and managed to scale it down to a smaller level. The Redeye was used in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan."

It was designed in DARPA in 1998 and sought to provide protection that has not been afforded to infantry since armor first went out of date. Although it is not nearly as effective against gunfire as plate armor was against swords. The Interceptor body armor consists of the OTV, the DAPS, and the MICH. The OTV is the vest which protects the neck, throat, biceps, and groin. The auxiliaries can be removed from the torso protection. The OTV contains ballistic plates and modern nylon compounds that can protect soldiers greater than any armor prior. The system also comes with the ability to protect the soldier with a thin Flattening Load Carrier vest to make carrying equipment easier. The DAPS are auxiliary protective sleeves intended to protect the legs and arms. The MICH is a lightweight kevlar helmet that comes with auxiliary ports to hold different pieces of equipment such as binoculars. "

The ICTV and SFICTV began development in the early 2000s by a variety of manufacturers with only the IOTV being developed by 2007 and the helmet series currently in development or conceptual. The ICTV is set to include a full set of body armor protecting almost the entirety of the body with gaps protected with interlocking fiber layers and lightweight metal plates. The helmet comes with ear and eye protection with auxiliary support for a protective bulletproof assault gas mask and support for binoculars. The SF variant is much lighter with much of the plating scaled back or segmented to aid movement. When it is developed, it will provide complete protection."

Issuing a Type 64 sniper rifle is usually granted to the individual with the most accurate shooting proficiency in each division (a designated marksman). However, in many cases the individual may simply be issued the scope by itself to be used only during training exercises and shooting competitions, while no specific rifle is assigned to the individual himself.\nThe issued optics are usually set at 2.2× magnification and may either be a surplus M1C/D sniper rifle M84 scope used by the U.S. Military during World War II or a similar model produced by Nikon that replicates the M84's magnification levels. Performance is similar to the M1C/D sniper rifle but it is only possible to set the scope to view targets at 500 meters despite the elevation knob being labeled for up to 800 meters. In addition to this, the standard aiming reticule is a simple black \"T\" which makes it extremely difficult to use during twilight hours or on a black target.\nSome serious complaints about the accuracy of the sniper version are linked to the poorly conceived attachment system for the scope. The scope goes askew easily because it is only affixed with one screw. After the scope is mounted and the rifle is zeroed, it is imperative that it be handled carefully because it is easily jostled. Furthermore, since the scope is not usually assigned to any particular rifle it is often difficult to keep it static on any particular rifle's receiver. This is usually corrected by installing a piece of cloth between the receiver and scope mount, but then the iron sights of the rifle are obscured. In cases like this, it is necessary to install a cheek pad to properly align the users eye with the scope."
