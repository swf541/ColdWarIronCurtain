 Nasser.2.d:0 "In stunning news today, the Egyptian government announced the death of Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer. He died under police custody due to suicide. Just last month Amer, along with dozens of other officers and officials were arrested for treason and he had been due to appear in court before his death. Many are speculating he committed suicide in order to avoid a humiliating trial and save face. While some other circles suggests the death appears pretty convenient for the embattled Egyptian President who has struggled to maintain his public image following the recent defeat to Israel. The Field Marshal's death marks a dramatic fall to a man once considered the closest ally to President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The two met during military training and Amer would play a leading role in the coup that brought Nasser to power. In the ensuing years, Amer led the Egyptian Army and headed the Ministry of Defense. By 1964 he was the first Vice President and would have succeeded Nasser if the President was incapacitated. However, the failure of Egypt to achieve victory over the Israelis in the war earlier this year saw his reputation collapse and he was dismissed from command once it was clear Israel had achieved a victory. Since the end of the war Amer has become the personification for the defeat and his refusal to resign from all posts has been rumored to have irked President Nasser."
 Nasser.1.d:0 "The famous Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb was sentenced to death by hanging this afternoon on the grounds of conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister Gamal Nasser. Sayyid Qutb was one of the leading intellectuals of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Political and Religious organization that is founded upon the belief that Islam is not simply a religion but a way of life. Sayyid Qutb is most known for his manifesto Ma'alim fi al-Tariq or also known as Milestones which called the Muslim community extinct claiming that they have fallen into a state of Jahiliyyah or age of ignorance. To cleanse Jahiliyyah a new Muslim world would have to be constructed with no one serving a president or parliament but rather people serving God. In his manifesto he describes anything non-Muslim or of Jahiliyyah is evil and corrupt and its existence anywhere should be intolerable to all true Muslims. Qutb's milestones also called for the formation of the Islamic Vanguard who would follow Qutb's twofold plan for the reconstruction of the Muslim world, which shall be done through conversion and offensive Jihad."
 Rogers_Plan.1.d:0 "President Gamal Abdel Nasser has accepted the proposal from United States Secretary of State William P. Rogers regarding peace between Egypt and Israel. The plan envisions a demilitarization of the Suez and its return to Egypt, Jerusalem becoming an international city administered by the three major religions, free passage for Israeli ships through the Suez, and negotiations would follow over the Gaza Strip and Sharm el Sheikh final status following an Israeli withdrawal from these territories. Although Soviet diplomats and close advisors have pointed out the plan seemed pro-Israeli and may result in backlash from the wider Arab World, Nasser believes the plan will be to his benefit. The plan will offer Palestinians an opportunity to return to their homes and also preserve Jerusalem as an open city. More importantly, resolving the military rivalry with Israel will save Egypt lots of resources and allow it to focus more heavily on spreading his pan-Arab nationalist vision across the region. Also, by engaging in peace efforts Egypt will demonstrate to the world its commitment to peace and if Israel rejects the plan, Egypt will gain more respect from the major powers. President Nasser expects his reputation and standing across the Arab World will help him and Egypt ride out any backlash from agreeing to the plan."
 an_Naksah.1.d:0 "Following the disaster of the 1967 War, the Egyptian people and government began to look suspiciously at their country's 3,000 year old Jewish community. Many Egyptians believed they had sympathized or actively aided the enemy, enabling them to decisively defeat the Egyptian military. With widespread public anger towards the Jewish community, President Gamal Abdel Nasser decided to direct the state's security and police agencies to engage in a campaign of arrests, intimidation, and deportation. For the Egyptian state and Nasser, blaming the Jewish community diverts public anger away from blaming the state for the recent setbacks. It also offers a convenient excuse to explain why the Egyptian military failed to achieve the ambitious goals promised by its leaders. Egyptian security forces have arrested large numbers of Jewish men, placing them in detention centers with no indication on when or if they will be released. The panic among the Jewish community has led to a flight as many Jewish families head to Israel, the United States, and across Europe. Many believe this latest round of repression may lead to the final decline of Egypt's once prominent Jewish community."
 Nasser.3.d:0 "This afternoon Chairman Gamal Abdel Nasser has announced the formation of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) as the sole legal, political party of the Arab Republic of Egypt. This was done according to Nasser's National Charter, which has called for nationalization, agrarian reforms, land reforms, and constitutional amendments. The Arab Socialist Union is a political party based on the ideals of Arab nationalism, Pan-Arabism and Arab socialist values, which will form the basis of decision making in the ASU.The Arab Socialist Union shall act as the supreme authority of the state of Egypt. The Arabs Socialist Union shall also include a general committee, a supreme executive committee, and a Secretary General and a President. Gamal Nasser will also be the first Secretary General of the Arab Socialist Union."
 nasser.10.d:0 "President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR) has announced his forces will soon cross the border and liberate the Arabs of Saudi Arabia. Fresh off the UAR's stunning victory over Israel, Nasser hopes to spread his vision of Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism across the Arab World. In his speech declaring war on Saudi Arabia, Nasser characterized the Saudi royal family as corrupt, imperialist stooges who utilize support form the West to maintain its hold over the Saudi people and curtail Arab revolutionary fervor. Nasser noted reactionary regimes like the Saudis had held the Arabs back, promoted internal bickering, and gave away its immense oil wealth to imperialist powers. He warned only by sheer determination had the UAR overcame Saudi machinations to achieve its great victory over Israel. Saudi Arabia has often been at odds with Nasser since he came to power in the early 1950s. Saudi Arabia often sought to censor and curtail the spread of Nasserism and pan-Arabism across the region and often backed regimes struggling to prevent a Nasserist takeover. The United Nations has viewed the UAR announcement with a great deal of alarm and has called for peace. The United States, Great Britain, and Soviet Union are both monitoring the situation closely as the UAR invasion threatens the global oil market. Many observers fear this war may lead to a greater, perhaps global conflict as few believe the United States can afford to have another vital global partner under threat."
 Al_Azhar.1.d:0 "Shaikh Mahmood Shaltoot the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar theological school of thought in Egypt, has issued a fatwa today recognizing Alawites, Shiites, and Druze as Muslims and should be treated without unjust prejudice. Al-Azhar is one of the main centers of Sunni scholarship of the world. Much to the delight of the Dar al-Taqreeb al-Madhahib al-Islamiyyah a group of Al-Azhar Sunni and Shia scholars who have laid the foundations for friendly relations and understanding between the different sects of Islam. Originally, before this the Druze, Shiites and Alawites were treated as heretics or heathens and were sometimes persecuted in Sunni communities of the Middle East throughout history. Gamal Abdel Nasser has also shown his support for the fatwa making sure the fatwa has been published all over the Middle East. This would bring the zenith of Sunni-Shiite relations for the next following decade."
 Syria_Seccession.1.d:0 "In the early morning of [ROOT.GetDateText], Lt. Colonel Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi, led troops to seize military installations, the radio station, and airport in a coup against the Egyptian union and a call for independent Syria. In the ensuing hours, many Syrian military units have pledged support to the coup and pro-United Arab Republic (UAR) leaders are increasingly isolated. The coup leaders announced over the radio the army has taken action to remove corruption and restore the rights of Syria's people. President Gamal Abdel Nasser has been caught off-guard by these developments he was not aware how deeply his authoritarian approach and economic policy of aggressive nationalization alienated Syrians. He has two choices, one is to accept the coup and the Syrian desire to restore its independence. This may help in Egypt being able to salvage good relations and perhaps a military alliance which is critical to Egypt's security. However, this is not guaranteed. The other option would be to support those Syrians still devoted to the UAR and the cause of Arab nationalism, perhaps supporting the pro-UAR faction in Syria with Egyptian military power can restore unity and demonstrate the strength of Nasser's vision for the Arab World."
 Syria_Seccession.2.d:0 "Following the military coup, the plotters and their supporters established a military junta. Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser responded to events with a defiant radio address where he claimed the coup lacked wide support and called on the Syrian Army to repress it. Despite his aggressive response, Nasser's supporters in Damascus were under arrest and most of the military firmly siding with the rebels, efforts to negotiate a compromise were rejected by Nasser who felt the UAR had to remain a centralized, socialist state to survive and could not compromise on these matters. Within days of Nasser's address, Egyptian officials in Syria, along with pro-UAR Syrians have quietly returned to Cairo. The UAR was established in 1958 and united Egypt with Syria under the leadership of the great Arab nationalist leader, President Nasser. In Syria, fears of a communist takeover and attraction to Arab nationalism pushed many political parties, especially the Ba'ath Party to push for an Egyptian union. However, hopes of a union among equals failed to materialize as following the UAR's establishment Nasser re-worked the constitution to ensure Egyptian political domination. Ba'ath Party leaders were side-stepped as key positions of government when to Egyptians and the Syrian military was put in subordination to the Egyptian military. Political parties were also purged, and political autonomy was gradually eroded in Syria. Economically, Nasser forced an aggressive program of nationalization and land reform but without much participation or input from Syrian socialists. The lack of political, economic, or military equality has led to increased tensions which have finally boiled over into the coup. While Nasser publicly denounced the coup and claimed the UAR remained strong, the reality is the UAR no longer exists and Syria was once again independent, under the control of its own military."
 Syria_Seccession.3.d:0 "President Gamal Abdel Nasser has addressed the nation following the coup in Syria, he has rejected the coup as one done by a small faction and in an extraordinary step stated Egyptian forces will be dispatched soon to help the Syrian Army putdown the coup. Nasser further described the coup as a plot by enemies of the Arab people to weaken the UAR and ensure imperialists and the enemies of Arabs can exploit the crisis. President Nasser's close confidant General Abdel Hakim Amer was in Damascus before the coup occurred. Following the coup he has been having meetings with Syrian military and political leaders to seek a compromise and following Nasser's decision to actively resist the coup has been able to gain support from some powerful Syrians who still adhered to their Arab nationalist beliefs. Syrian commanders along the coast had been wavering and about to join the coup. Upon hearing Nasser's speech, they have decided to not detain Egyptian military officials and now firmly hold these coastal bases in anticipation to Egyptian support. As the Syrian military now looks to be divided, civil war appears inevitable. The coup leaders have more popular support, however, the pro-UAR factions are emboldened by Nasser's aggressive response."
 suezcrisisnews.1.d:0 "The joint Anglo-French-Israeli operation to secure the Sinai and the Suez Canal from the Egyptian government has proven to be a spectacular success. The operation came about after the nationalist Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized the Suez Canal. His forces largely disintegrated in the face of the invading armies, with the Suez and Sinai taken with little resistance. The military failure could not be hidden from the Egyptian public who felt betrayed by Nasser and the nationalist military leadership for their incompetence. The Anglo-French forces then aided the enraged Egyptian middle class and anti-nationalist officers in the military to overthrow Nasser, end combat operations, and confirm British control of the Suez. Without Nasser the space was opened for the return of King Farouk to the throne. An elaborate ceremony in Cairo marked his re-enthronement, with senior Egyptian, British, and French officials in attendance. The general public was excluded to prevent any embarrassing incidents."
 suezcrisisnews.2.d:0 "The Sinai Crisis ended with the Anglo-French forces agreeing to withdraw from the Suez. Although their partner Israel continues to hold the Sinai they are also expected to return to pre-war positions. Militarily the joint Anglo-French-Israeli operation appeared to be a stunning success with Egyptian forces pushed back in disarray. However, international outcry, especially from the two superpowers forced a ceasefire and withdrawal. The invasion began as a response to the decision taken by the nationalist Egyptian government to nationalize the Suez Canal. The Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser is proclaiming an Egyptian victory and Arab triumph over global imperialism. Despite his forces suffering defeats, the population and wider Arab World were fed false reports of Egyptian military victories and the withdrawal announcement appears to confirm that narrative. The international outcry across the globe and superpower pressure shows the freedom of action long enjoyed by colonial states will not be tolerated by the wider international community."
 Yemani_Coup.1.d:0 "Imam Muhammad Al Badr took over the throne of Yemen following his father's death in 1962. Despite his royal background he long admired Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser and one of his first acts was to promote known Nasserist, Colonel Abdullah Sallal to command the Palace Guard. This despite his father's anti-Nasser stance and the threat Arab nationalism had already posed to the Imamate. Al Badr's father brutally crushed a coup attempt in 1955 by Nasserist officers who sought to end the monarchy. In Egypt, President Nasser openly supported anti-royal Yemeni officers and Egyptian diplomats quietly supported multiple plots against Al Badr. Abdullah Sallal, in cooperation with other conspirators, planned to deploy tanks and armed troops to assault Al Badr's palace on the night of September 26th 1962. The planned coup was put in motion after Sallal learned Al Badr was aware of plots against him. Years of tension between revolutionaries and supporters of the monarchy have now boiled over and it appears Al Badr's efforts to work with the Nasserist factions may have backfired on him as Sallal's coup begins to be set in motion."
 Yemani_Coup.2.d:0 " By 11:45 pm on the night of the coup, Colonel Abdullah Sallal's tanks began pounding the royal palace, Muhammad Al Badr tried to lead a resistance but due to the overwhelming firepower he was forced to escape the palace and has been driven from his capital San'a. Sallal's forces quickly secured key installations across the city, including the radio station and airport. Other revolutionary officers, many who had been sympathetic to the 1955 coup attempt have started to seize control in other major cities across Yemen. The radio has announced the overthrow of Al Badr and an end to a corrupt monarchy which had crippled the development of Yemen as a people and as a part of the Arab world. Sallal solidified control over the Revolution by purging non-Nasserists and Egypt dispatched senior officers to assess what aid the Sallal regime needed. Despite pronouncements that Al Badr had died during the assault on the palace, the Yemeni King had survived and was making his way north, securing support from tribesmen and settling in Saudi Arabia."
 Yemani_Coup.3.d:0 "On the morning of September 26th, 1962, a royalist officer informed Imam Muhammad Al Badr that his commander of the palace guard and known Nasserist Colonel Abdullah Sallal had opened the armory of the military academy to arm troops and junior officers. In addition, Sallal informed Al Badr that tanks were going to be moved that night near the palace and Al Badr should not be concerned. Suspicious of these actions, Al Badr called on loyal officers and soldiers to meet with him and just a few hours before Sallal's tanks were to be moved into position to assault the palace, Al Badr had Sallal arrested and cancelled orders to move the tanks. A concurrent plot to send an armored car and secure the radio station and airport by Lieutenant Ali Abdul Moghny was easily broken up through his men did briefly seize the radio station. Within hours the coup plot has been broken and its main conspirators either in custody or on the run."
 Tiran_Closing.1.d:0 "In the latest escalation at the Sinai, Egyptian President [EGY.GetLeader] announced the closing of the Straits of Tiran to all ships destined for Israel, declaring that ships attempting to violate the blockade will be fired upon. This news follows the re-militarization of the Sinai by Egyptian forces on May 14th and the demand for the expulsion of UN peacekeepers on May 16th. Nasser has declared that \"We are ready for war... These waters are ours. If Israel wishes to threaten war, we tell her: You are welcome\". Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister [ISR.GetLeader] repeated the warning of 1957, that any closure of the Straits would be seen as an act of war. Reports have arrived of Israeli tank movements in response to the Egyptian deployment in the Sinai. Tensions are mounting in the region, as diplomats try to resolve the crisis before it escalates any further. Israel receives 90 percent of its oil through the Straits and observers view this as a grave threat to the Israeli economy. Arabs across the region have been galvanized by [EGY.GetLeader]'s actions and eagerly support his policy towards Israel."
 aswan.100.d:0 "Over 10 years after construction started, Egypt finally completed the Awan Dam. The project saw tens of thousands of Egyptian engineers and workers, with the help of Soviet financing and expertise, complete this massive project. This success represents a great achievement for Arab-Soviet cooperation. With the Aswan Dam, Egypt hopes to utilize the Nile for its hydroelectricity, help control flooding, and lead to an agricultural boom for the country. The reservoir has been named Lake Nasser after Egypt's visionary President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Plans for the dam started in the early 1950s and became a key component to Nasser's plans to modernize Egypt. The completion of this project represents independent Egypt's greatest development project since escaping the yoke of Western imperialism and many Egyptians are optimistic this will lead to an economic golden age."
 
 black_saturday.1.d:0 "The unrest began at Almaza Airport, when workers there refused to provide services to British airplanes. It was followed by the rebellion of policemen, who wished to express their solidarity with their dead and captured colleagues. Protesters then headed towards the university building, where they were joined by students. Together they marched towards the prime minister's office to demand that Egypt break its diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and declare war on it. They were told that the government wished to do so, but faced opposition from the king. As a result, protesters went to Abdeen Palace and expressed its discontent towards the king. The first act of arson took place in Opera Square where fire spread to multiple shops, corporate offices, movie theaters, hotels and banks. The fires also reached the neighborhoods of Faggala, Daher, Citadel, Tahrir Square and Cairo Train Station Square. Due to the chaos, theft and looting occurred until the Egyptian Army arrived."

However, some sources report that he took his own life while others claim that he was assassinated by the government. Whatever the official truth might be, one thing is for certain: a new time dawns for Egypt."
 egy_trial.2.d:0 "Now that Naguib has secured his supremacy over Nasser, it is time to decide what to do with him. Firstly, We can let him live a normal life in Cairo. If we want to punish him, we can force him into exile and ban him from ever coming back or we could imprison him for several years."
 egy_trial.3.d:0 "Very few people remember the name Gamal Abdel Nasser. Once one of the leading members of the Revolutionary Command Council, he eventually tried to overthrow Naguib which ended in his failure. After the failed coup he disappeared from politics and according to anonymous sources, is currently living somewhere in Cairo."
 egy_trial.4.d:0 "Gamal Abdel Nasser, once a major figure in Revolutionary Command Council has just been forced into exile. Reports indicate that he was escorted to the airport in gunpoint where he boarded a plane to a unknown destination. Outside the airport several people were  protesting against this, claiming that Nasser was Egypt's salvation and now Egypt is doomed."
 egy_trial.5.d:0 "Breaking news from Cairo's court house. Gamal Abdel Nasser, former high ranking member of the Revolutionary Command Council has just been sentenced to 15 years in jail due to his attempted coup of president Naguib. Nasser will serve his time in the Tora Prison."

 farouk_gang.1.d:0 "King Farouk has announced today that all red cars in Egypt are banned effective immediately and only he is allowed to own any. The only exceptions are the military jeeps, painted red, that travel as part of the king's entourage.\nThe king is known for his fleet of expensive cars, including a 1947 fiery red Bentley Mark VI and a red Mercedes Benz 540K which was a gift from Adolf Hitler.\nMuch of King Farouk's loyalists have praised the law stating that the King should be the only one who is worthy to use such vehicles. Anonymous opponents have criticized the law as "absolutely insane" and "completely meaningless". Several individuals have come to the anonymous interview simply to state that the king has shot their tires while they were trying to pass him. The king called these accusations "unproven"."

Recently, it has become public note that Riyad Ghali, royal advisor to the King of Egypt, has proposed to Princess Fathia of Egypt. Despite strong objections from King Farouk, the marriage proceeded at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. It was also brought to light that both of them have converted to Catholicism and plan to live together. In response, King Farouk has announced that Princess Fathia are banned from Egypt and excommunicated. All of their possessions still in Egypt have been confiscated by the state."
 farouk_gang.3.d:0 "The king has returned from his diplomatic trip to France. According to him, the trip was fruitful and will surely improve the relations between Egypt and France. However, anonymous sources state that the trip was a massive failure. First of all, during the official party held in Paris, Farouk reportedly pick-pocketed watches, wallets and cigarette lighters. Then, during his free time he went on a 70-hour gambling rampage, during which he supposedly lost 150,000 dollars, got blackout drunk and assaulted a woman for not sleeping with him. Of course, all of these are just rumors and surely made up by someone jealous of the king."
 farouk_gang.4.d:0 "The king has just returned from his trip to France. Farouk together his entourage consisting of his "kitchen cabinet", 30 Albanian bodyguards, assorted Egyptian secretaries and doctors, Sudanese food tasters and various other followers traveled across the French countryside in a column of 7 Cadillacs surrounded by motorcycle-riding bodyguards and an airplane flying overhead with orders to land in case Farouk wanted to fly instead. At the casino he won around 40 million marcs. He then crossed over to San Sebastian in Spain to attend a film festival with four "of his ladies of the moment". Farouk's next stop was Cannes, where he engaged in a $80,000 game of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino with people such as the Hollywood mogul Jack L. Warner and the British industrialist Myers Hyman. Hyman won the game and then promptly died of a heart-attack, leading to newspaper headlines such as "Lucky Mickie Beats Farouk-and Dies!""
 nasser_execution.1.d:0 "The hunt for Nasser has finally come to a close. After a long and arduous manhunt, Egyptian police found the traitorous Nasser held up in a cell inside of Cairo. After establishing a blockade, the Sudanese guard was called in to arrest Nasser and kill the defenders of the building. Nasser was brought before King Farouk where he stood a fair and just trial for his crimes. It was ultimately decided that his crime must be capitally punished and was executed by strangulation personally by King Farouk."
 sudan_part.1.d:0 "The fight against British rule had the Sudanese region embroiled in a terrible conflict. Our noble King Farouk desiring to maintain order and peace, established a peacekeeping mission. Not wanting to contribute to the conflict, Egyptian forces built garrisons and administrative headquarters to ensure order. After 4 years, the conflict has finally come to an end with the British colonial garrison withdrawing and Sudanese forces almost depleted. Because the only remaining organized Sudanese force remains in the south, King Farouk has established control over the anarchic Sudanese region. The South Sudanese government has sent a formal protest to the King over this, but King Farouk responded stating they were in no condition to govern the ravaged north. King Farouk has openly admitted to the Egyptian people that he is not sure South Sudan is even a functional government in its current state. He is currently considering sending peacekeepers to the South to establish order there, too."
 farouk_exiled.1.d:0 "The new regime in Egypt has quickly decided to auction off the King's vast collection of treasures, including his seven-piece bedroom suite. Among the more famous of his possessions was one of the rare 1933 Double Eagle coins. Attracting much interest was the revelation that Farouk owned one of the largest collections of pornography in the world as he possessed a vast collection numbering into the hundreds of thousands of pornographic photographs, postcards, calendars, playing cards, watches, glasses, corkscrews and so on. Farouk's obsession with collecting also ranged into diamonds, dogs, stamps, rubies, Faberge eggs, ancient Tibetan coins, medieval suits of armor, aspirin bottles, razor blades, paper clips and Geiger counters. At the Koubbeh Palace, it was discovered that Farouk had collected 2,000 silk shirts, 10,000 silk ties, 50 diamond-studded golden walking sticks and one autographed portrait of Adolf Hitler."
 Free_Officer_Coup.1.d:0 "The Free Officer Coup has just succeeded in Cairo and will result in the expelling of King Farouk from the country. Upon hearing that the Free Officers were planning a coup, King Farouk ordered their arrest. However, the Free Officers found out about this order and decided to launch a preemptive attack and evade the arrest. With the inability to arrest the Free Officers, King Farouk got the assistance of the loyal Sudanese guard to fortify his palace. In the evening, the Free Officers mounted a siege and attacked. They were unable to break the fortifications in the palace and were forced to fall back. King Farouk himself killed 4 attackers with his sniper rifle from a makeshift embrasure on his balcony. The next day, armored reinforcements arrived for the Free Officers. The Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to surrender, threatening to destroy the palace with artillery. With no way to destroy the reinforcements, King Farouk surrendered."
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After a brief siege, the Free Officers decided to mount an assault on the palace of King Farouk and secure the country. The King was guarded by approximately 800 well equipped Sudanese guardsmen. King Farouk, an expert marksman, participated in the defense, allegedly killing approximately 16 attackers as they entered the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. However, this left their forces vulnerable and they sustained heavy casualties. With the attackers weakened, King Farouk ordered a counterattack against the now disorganized and severely weakened Free Officer force. In the end, nearly thirty Free Officers surrendered but they were summarily executed. King Farouk declared a state of emergency and called on patriotic Egyptians to find Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the Free Officer leaders who escaped the counterattack. Analysts expect the King to purge nationalist in the Army and buildup the security apparatus."
 Sudan.1.d:0 "After the revolution of 1952 in Egypt broke off the ability for the UK's forces to reach Sudan, Sudan was able to rebel against the UK and gain its independence easily. However, not all is happy in the Sudanese region. There is a massive level of political fractionalization and huge ideological and ethnic divides in the country. The new Sudanese government cannot even decide on how to comprise the new government or a fair way to decide which one should rule the country. The most pressing issues include the lack of civil service workers, a lack of industrialization to support the independent nation, rebellion in the South, and many other problems. If the country is unable to resolve these issues, it may experience serious problems in the coming years."
 abolish_mon_egy.1.d:0 "The transitional government of Egypt has abolished the monarchy. The rule of King Farouk's son, King Faud II, was very short lived as his appointment was only a ruse to appease the British. Gamal Abdel Nasser has been appointed deputy premier and General Naguib has has been appointed as the first president. With the abolition of the monarchy came the newly founded Constitution of the Republic of Egypt. The Constitution has promised secularism and civil rights.\nThere are, however, many individuals who were loyal to the king who are angry that they will no longer receive benefits and spoils from the king. Angrier than the former officers and loyalists, the Muslim Brotherhood is staunchly opposed to the secularism of the new republic and may cause issues for the newly founded Republic if not dealt with."
 egy_trial.1.d:0 "The Royal Officers, military officers loyal to the King, are being put on trial for collusion in crimes against Egypt. The charges include things such as general corruption and abuse of power but many officers are being brought to trial for specific offenses such as brutality or direct theft. The trials will take a long period of time and more complex cases where evidence is hard to gather will likely last for months. Already, some officers have attempted to flee the country in an attempt to escape potential punishment."
 egy_rioting.1.d:0 "After months of firebranding, the Islamic Brotherhood is currently participating in a massive statewide riot. The Islamic Brotherhood has, since the first drafting of the Egyptian Constitution, despised the newly founded Republic. Their primary complaints are the secularization of the country and the liberalization of the Muslim faith under the political atmosphere of the government. Many leading theorists such as Sayyid Qutb have published works declaring that Egypt has become no longer Islamic and that the state must be overthrown. Already, rioters have taken over key regions in multiple cities across Egypt and are destroying government property en masse. Government security forces are clashing heavily with the rioters in the streets."
 egy_suez_funding.1.d:0 "The Aswan High Dam has finally received funding and will be built across the Nile. The Dam is expected to span ~3800 meters with a tremendous height of ~110m. The dam will support industrialization with its electricity, control flooding, provide water infrastructure, and irrigate farmlands for large distances. Additionally, the dam will create a lake that has been prematurely named "Lake Nasser" after the revolutionary leader. Currently the Egyptian government is beginning mass hiring and contracting in order to accumulate the manpower and resources necessary to build the dam now that the funding has been secured."
 RCC_Crisis.1.d:0 "The council is in crisis about who should rule Egypt."
