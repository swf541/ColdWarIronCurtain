 truman_address_korean_war:0 "Address the Korean War"
 truman_address_korean_war_desc:0 "On Sunday, June 25th, Communist forces attacked the Republic of Korea. This attack has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations. An act of aggression such as this creates a very real danger to the security of all free nations. The Communist invasion was launched in great force, with planes, tanks, and artillery. The size of the attack, and the speed with which it was followed up, make it perfectly plain that it had been plotted long in advance. Fifty-two of the 59 countries which are members of the United Nations have given their support to the action taken by the Security Council to restore peace in Korea. Under the flag of the United Nations a unified command has been established for all forces of the members of the United Nations fighting in Korea. Gen. Douglas MacArthur is the commander of this combined force. The prompt action of the United Nations to put down lawless aggression, and the prompt response to this action by free peoples all over the world, will stand as a landmark in mankind's long search for a rule of law among nations. Furthermore, the fact that Communist forces have invaded Korea is a warning that there may be similar acts of aggression in other parts of the world. The free nations must be on their guard, more than ever before, against this kind of sneak attack."
 truman_dismiss_macarthur:0 "Announce the Reason for the Dismissal of Douglas MacArthur"
 truman_dissmiss_macarthur_desc:0 "I believe that we must try to limit the war to Korea for these vital reasons: to make sure that the precious lives of our fighting men are not wasted; to see that the security of our country and the free world is not needlessly jeopardized; and to prevent a third world war. A number of events have made it evident that General MacArthur did not agree with that policy. I have therefore considered it essential to relieve General MacArthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy. It was with the deepest personal regret that I found myself compelled to take this action. General MacArthur is one of our greatest military commanders. But the cause of world peace is much more important than any individual. The change in commands in the Far East means no change whatever in the policy of the United States. We will carry on the fight in Korea with vigor and determination in an effort to bring the war to a speedy and successful conclusion. The new commander, Lt. Gen. Matthew Ridgway, has already demonstrated that he has the great qualities of military leadership needed for this task. That war can come if the Communist rulers want it to come. But this Nation and its allies will not be responsible for its coming. We do not want to widen the conflict. We will use every effort to prevent that disaster. And in so doing, we know that we are following the great principles of peace, freedom, and justice."

 truman_against_communism_desc:0 "The free world must have armed strength, the free world must have it now! Not in reserve, not later but now! As your president, I am telling you that the dangers in other parts of the world as just as great as they are in Korea. Everyday reports come to my desk about Soviet military preparations around the world, if any one of you can see these reports and receive the same information, you will give up any thoughts that danger is over. We can not let down our aware no matter what happens in Korea. We must have men, ships, planes, tanks and and bombs on ready for any emergency and if we have them we will have to use them!"

 cancel_berlin_airlift_desc:0 "Berlin Airlift has proven to be costly and ineffective. The Soviets won't yield an inch since it doesn't affect them as much as it affects the legitimate German Government! Let's put an end to this."
 truman_speech_congress_desc:0 "Peace is our goal, not peace at any price but peace based on freedom and justice. This year 1952 is a critical year in the defense effort of the whole free world. If we falter we can lose all the gains that we've made. A threat of world war is still very real. We had one Pearl Harbor, let's not get caught off guard again. Our kind of Government above all others cannot tolerate dishonesty among public servants. I intend to see to it that federal employees who have been guilty of misconduct get punished for it. Let us go forward trusting in the God of peace to win the goal we seek."
