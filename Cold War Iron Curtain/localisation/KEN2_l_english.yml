 kenya.1.d:0 "  Oh sweet Chief, how we loved you so! Last night, the commonwealth lost one of its most loyal and charasmatic figures in East Africa. Just outside of Nairobi the beloved chief was being chauffered when three gunmen shot through the car, killing Waruhiu instantly. Waruhiu was a true advocate for British colonial rule, an outspoken critic of independence groups and various indeginous people vying for unnecessary autonomy. These murderers are being referred to as Mau Mau, our secretaries are linking this assassination with multiple other murders and acts of violence towards white settlers in the colony and protectorate of Kenya."
 kenya.3.d:0 "This spring, the princess Elizabeth was visiting the crown colony and protectorate of Kenya as part of a trip around the empire. After recieving endless praise and attention in Nairobi, the princess and her entourage endevoured on a safari in the rift valley. However, little to her knowledge the previous afternoon King Edward had circumed to his lung cancer leaving her as heir apperent."
 kenya.4.d:0 "Kenya like many Swahili nations is filled with many ethnic organizations and movements inscrutable to outside British observers. Traveling mystics, cult leaders, and tribal populists, and such wonder throughout the country but recently there have been reports of large movements of Kikuyu tribesmen; traveling as organized armies. This, culminating with recent hostilities of indeginous peoples and white settlers in the highlands, is leading some to wonder if something more sinister is afoot."

However, the prophet escaped his detention and lead several loyal followers throughout the country side. The provisional governor, Alan Stevens is confronting the prophet with his 300 or so spear armed followers."
 kenya.8.d:0 "The leader of the Kenyan African Union, Jomo Kenyatta has been imprisoned for sedition. Despite speaking out against the Mau Mau, advocating peacful reform, and opposing labor strikes and criminal behavior; the government of the crown colony of kenya has found his arrest absolutely necessary. Though many call for his complete exile from the Kenya, many believe this would justify the independence movements of the nation by making him a political martyr. We shall see what this brings in the future."
 kenya.9.d:0 "Socialists, Pan-Africanists, anti-imperialists, general rebels, regardless of what they label themselves as, the students across Nairobi are protesting on an uncontrollable level. Many of these protests have devolved into acts of looting and rioting throughout the center of the city."
