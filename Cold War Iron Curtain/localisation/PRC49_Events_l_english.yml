 #1960s PRC News Events
 CulRevPurge.1.d:0 "Chairman Mao and his supporters have utilized direct denouncements, targeted articles in party newspapers, and the use of political allies to orchestrate a series of purges against senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. These purges are removing moderates who in recent years gained prominence in order to restore the Chinese economy and stability. However, these purges are necessary for Mao and his supporters to take control of key positions and to rehabilitate the image of Mao as the true leader of the revolution in China. Those targeted by the purges are often being removed from political posts and in more extreme cases are being arrested for counter-revolutionary activity."
 Enlais_Tour.1.d:0 "Prominent Chinese communist leader and former Foreign Minister, Premier Zhou Enlai has embarked on a global tour. Enlai plans on visiting many countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East where he hopes to demonstrate Chinese power and influence. The trip will demonstrate China is a global force and is looking beyond its borders. The Chinese are eager to demonstrate its support for the revolutionary struggles currently taking place against reactionary and imperialist regimes. Another major objective of the Premier is to lobby support among the newly emerging independent states to build support for China at the United Nations."
 PRCUN.1.d:0 "Decolonization has seen the emergence of a new Third World of powers, mostly concentrated in Africa and Asia. These states possess a great deal of optimism, youth, and opportunity that China cannot ignore. More importantly, many of these states only achieved independence through revolutionary action against colonial masters. The Chinese government is reaching out and lobbying with these governments to offer their support for the PRC at the United Nations where many of the former colonial powers and the United States continue to hinder handing us our rightful place within the global community. We must rally the Third World and teach its leaders to support us against the imperialist machinations at the United Nations."
 CulRev.11.d:0 "Under the direction of youth leaders and devoted party activists, millions of books are being ripped out of libraries, cultural, and religious centers to be burned in public bonfires. Books that discuss counter-revolutionary ideas, contradict the guidance of Mao, historical works, religious texts, or works of fiction that glorify the reactionary past are all among the works being collected for burnings. To cleanse China and purify the party, a direct destruction of the past and its impurities is essential. Mao teaches for new revolutionary literature and art to emerge, the past must be cleansed and not allowed to interfere with the continuous revolution. Anyone who opposed the burnings or tried to stop the collection of books were detained and will be tried as reactionaries."
 CulRev.12.d:0 "One of the main stumbling blocks to continuous revolution and ending the influence of the reactionary past is the continued existence of glorified graves of noble and revered leaders from the past. These grave sites become spaces of false worship and glorification, especially of people who had exploited and oppressed the masses to achieve their fame. Throughout the country revolutionary youths are digging up these graves and tombs, denouncing the remains and then burning them. Destroying the space afterwards to ensure this false glorification of the past is removed. Of particular note is the raid on the Ming tombs where the remains of the Wanli Emperor and his empresses were similarly destroyed. Archaeological digs of grave sites are being immediately halted, archaeologists who refuse or complain of these actions are being detained."
 CulRevPurge.4.d:0 "Religion has long held the people of China from truly embracing the revolution and obeying its principles. Religion breeds superstition and removes the energy and resources of the people it tricks. Although Buddhist and Muslim religious sites are also major targets, the focus of the Red Guard and revolutionary youths has been sites of Confucian knowledge and historical significance. Across China Confucius temples are being besieged, including the Temple of Confucius in Shandong. Relics are being smashed while written works and collections, many priceless, are being torn up or burned by the revolutionaries. Confucian cemeteries and other sites are similarly being ransacked in order to purge China of its attachment to the reactionary old ways that hinder the embrace of continuous revolution."
 PLA_CulRev.1.d:0 "With the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation and the activities of the Red Guards going unsupervised, there was a growing fear within the senior party leaders that the situation was escalating. Chairman Mao, sensing this and the growing dispute within the party over the radical revolutionaries and establishment party members wishing to maintain stability, asked the PLA under famed military leader Lin Biao to deploy and aid the left. Although this implied the PLA should support the radicals, this was not explicit and instead most PLA units began supporting the establishment party members. These units are actively curbing Red Guard excesses and ensuring the radical faction in certain areas does not gain access to heavy weaponry or overthrow the local party leaderships."
 HyperCulRev.1.d:0 "As the Cultural Revolution in China rages, the conflict between the radical factions within the party against the more moderate, established party leadership shifted in favor of the radicals. Former Chinese President and at one time the second most powerful man in China, Liu Shaoqi was executed. Although he chaired the meeting that launched the Cultural Revolution, hoping to combat corruption and reform the country, Mao and his supporters quickly took control of it and orchestrated the downfall of Shaoqi and his arrest. He was being held in harsh conditions, but many in China expected he would simply be imprisoned. His execution for being a secret capitalist and traitor indicates the radicals are more firmly established and is a blow to those in the party hoping a future rehabilitation of Shaoqi could help move the country towards an end to the violence."
 HyperCulRev.2.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping, who helped oversee an economic reform campaign to mitigate Maoist economic damages, was executed by the government. This stunning news indicates that within the Chinese Communist Party leadership the radical Maoist are gaining prominence over the establishment party members. Prior to this announcement, Deng had not been formally arrested, though soon after the Cultural Revolution began, he was a target of the Red Guards. The Red Guards thought his economic reforms were capitalistic and opposed Mao. Unlike his political ally Liu Shaoqi, Deng was only purged of his national positions. However, he was very quickly tried, convicted, and then executed. Although some rumors speculate Deng had simply been executed by emotional Red Guards. Deng was still closely allied with some of the remaining establishment party members who are now looking at their future with grave concern following this latest announcement."
 HyperCulRev.5.d:0 "With the pre-Cultural Revolution leader Liu Shaoqi executed along with the young economic reformer Deng Xiaoping, the position of the establishment communist party members appeared numbered. Since the executions, few have spoken out or challenged the radical wing of the party from expanding the revolution. In the latest news, the Chinese Communist Party announced it was purging itself of conservatism and stated among the latest to be removed from the national government is famed statesman Zhou Enlai. Enlai has been a major part of the party since the 1930s and the face of the government abroad. He was also close with the executed Deng and it is believed if he tried to resist, he would have risked facing the same fate of Deng and being convicted as a partner to the traitor. There is now complete uncertainty over who or if anyone in the government is trying to mitigate or control the level of violence that appears to be escalating by the day."
 HyperCulRev.6.d:0 "The Last Emperor of China Puyi was killed by Red Guards who took him to the street, publicly humiliated him for his imperial past and then killed the elderly former ruler of Manchukuo. After the end of World War II, the Soviets held Puyi before transferring him to Chinese custody. The Chinese Communist Party sent him to a rehabilitation center where he was eventually rehabilitated and moved to Beijing. Although a strong supporter of communism and a spokesman for the regime, the Red Guards did not consider him reformed especially as his autobiography was published in foreign languages considered suspicious, English and French. Senior party leaders like Zhou Enlai had used their influence to protect Puyi, but with the latest purge of establishment party leaders, his protection ended, and he quickly fell to the Red Guard."
 PRC_Congress.1.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China successfully concluded recently. Lin Biao delivered the keynote address to cheering delegates who supported his praise of continuous revolution. The recent purges of former President Liu Shaoqi and his ally Deng Xiaoping was confirmed and approved, and delegates were elected. The radical wing of the party made substantial gains in terms of representatives, especially from the Red Guard, and had their main guiding principles, like continuous revolution enshrined in the constitution. However, Lin Biao ended up being the main winner as he was confirmed to be the successor of Mao and his supporters in the PLA also gained many seats. Many view these two developments as an indication that though the radicals remain powerful, they can still be checked and managed, especially by the PLA."
 PRC_Congress.2.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded recently and its results are being received by cheering crowds across China. The Congress ratified continuous revolution and other principles of the Cultural Revolution as part of the constitution. In the address by Mao, he promised the Cultural Revolution will continue and called on all workers to expand the scope of it and deliver China from reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces. The Congress praised the swift justice in the recent executions of former President Liu Shaoqi and his ally Deng Xiaoping and confirmed the purging of Zhou Enlai as the correct course. The Congress will be dominated by representatives of the radical revolutionaries and the Red Guard. The recent sidelining of the PLA and the purge of the establishment wing of the party meant power now lies almost completely in the hands of party radicals."
 PRC_Congress.3.d:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of China recently concluded. The Congress ratified and openly approved the reforms initiated by President Shaoqi. Shaoqi was praised for his wise leadership and mind for improving the lives of the people. Notably, the elections saw many reformers and Shaoqi supporters gain seats. Members of the old guard and the more devoted Maoist did not gain many seats following their recent purge. In addition, the military seats remained limited, also reflected the success of Shaoqi in controlling the institution. By the end of the party it was clear Shaoqi remains firmly in control and his reforms have become constitutionally ratified."
 BeijingSpring.1.d:0 "The failures of the Great Leap Forward along with efforts to end political isolation has led to a decline in the influence of Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong. Even within the higher echelons of the party his revolutionary rhetoric has lost its previous impact. Taking advantage of this, President Liu Shaoqi has emerged with a reformist vision for the country. He has already announced plans to roll back the more radical Maoist economic policies to help the economy recover. More significantly, he has opened the government up to public criticism in what is being called the Beijing Spring. Chinese citizens are allowed to critique what they do not like about the government, reflecting a liberalization of society. What this new openness will lead to remains to be seen."
 ZhenbaoConflict.1.d:0 "Tensions have risen even higher between The People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union as Chairman Mao Zedong has requested the return island of Zhenbao also known as Damansky Island in the Soviet Union and a revision of the Treaty of Aigun. Zhenbao is is a small island in the Ussuri River marking the current border of Manchuria and Russian Outer Manchuria. Russia acquired Outer Manchuria during the years of the decline of Qing, The Western Powers and the Russian Empire enforced several "Unfair Treaties" two of these treaties; The Treaty of Aigun and the First Convention of Peking granted several Chinese concessions to the Western Powers and Russian Empire including cession of Outer Manchuria to Russia including all islands on the Ussuri River, which would include the Zhenbao Island. Chairman Mao has cited these treaties as nothing but blatant opportunistic imperialism as has claimed that the Soviet Union as an enemy of Imperialism should rectify both treaties. In recent news, it has been reported that both the People’s Liberation Army and Soviet Army have mobilized on the border of Zhenbao while negotiations are still ongoing. Many fear that the negotiations will go south and potentially spark a full-scale conflict between the two powers."
 ZhenbaoConflict.10.d:0 "Shockingly this morning a small group of Chinese soldiers ambushed Soviet forces garrisoned on Zhenbao and have seized the island. The media so far has nick-named the incident "The Zhenbao Incident". Apparently this attack was in response to General Secretary Krushchev’s refusal to sign an agreement ceding Zhenbao to The People’s Republic of China. So far the Soviets haven't retaliated and neither side has yet to comment or respond about the incident. Many fear this would result in a full-scale conventional war between the two superpowers. Frighteningly both nations have access to nuclear weaponry which could be used against each other. Some speculate it will just be a border conflict nothing more however, others speculate it could be the catalyst for a nuclear war between the two superpowers and end with the devastation and destruction of both nations."
 ZhenbaoConflict.30.d:0 " The Secretary General of the Soviet Union announced today that a state of war exists between his country and the People’s Republic of China. Minor skirmishes along the Heilongjiang and Xinjiang borders have prompted the Soviets to deploy the full weight of their military might against China. Reports indicate that Soviet and Chinese forces have already come into contact with one another along the border, and additional troops, supplies and aircraft are streaming towards the front. While who started the Zhenbao island incident remains somewhat unclear, what is clear is that both sides appear committed to see this conflict through to the bitter end. Some observers fear a nuclear exchange may be on the horizon, but even if the conflict remains conventional, it is clear that the stakes are nothing less than the moral leadership of the entire communist world."
 ZhenbaoConflict.25.d:0 "After a few days of fierce fighting over Zhenbao Island, Soviet and Chinese forces have agreed to a ceasefire. The Soviet Union appears to have responded to the Chinese seizure of the island with a limited counterattack of mechanized forces supported by a significant volume of artillery fire. Clashes on and around the island have been largely indecisive, and the threat of escalation remained throughout until negotiations were facilitated by mutual allies of the PRC and Soviet Union throughout the Communist world. The terms of the ceasefire include no territorial changes, the Soviets will retain control over Zhenbao. Both sides claim victory in the skirmish, the Soviets because of the ceasefire terms, and the Chinese because of the damage inflicted to Soviet forces, and it remains to be seen how this will affect the unity of the world’s communist community."
 ZhenbaoConflict.31.d:0 "After a brief, but intense clash of Soviet and Chinese troops over the disputed Zhenbao island, the Secretary General of the Soviet Union and the Premier of China have come to an arrangement. Peace negotiations concluded after it became clear that Soviet forces were unable or unwilling to dislodge the Chinese troops occupying Zhenbao island. The Politburo has issued a statement acknowledging that the various 19th Century treaties outlining the Sino-Russian border are null and void, having been made between bourgeois governments that no longer represent the will of the people. The language of the agreement appears to be a hollow effort to save face on the Soviets part, after what must have been an embarrassing defeat in Zhenbao. Renegotiations of the border are expected to favor China, and the Soviet Union’s ability to lead the communist world has been seriously called into question."
 Cultural_Rev.2.d:0 "More formally known as Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the "Little Red Book" has rapidly become a focus of revolutionary rhetoric in [PRC.GetNameDef]. The innocuous red book contains 267 collected quotes from Mao Zedong, and espouses ideas of unity between the party and the popular masses, the correction of mistaken ideas, and the constant struggle against imperial and class oppressors. Most notably, Mao mentions that, even under socialism, class enemies still exist, and they must be purged endlessly to ensure that the socialist dream is achieved. This rhetoric of a constant "cultural revolution" has been taken to heart by the youths reading it across China. Inspired by the stories from their parents and grandparents about the People’s War of Liberation against the Kuomintang, students and soldiers are taking up the torch of revolution from their predecessors in order to fulfill this dream of an even more glorious revolution. They are now taking to the streets across China in support of Chairman Mao, and his incendiary little red book."

 #Country Events
 CulRevPurge.2.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping served as a political commissar during the Civil War and emerged as a promising rising star in the Chinese Communist Party. When the radical economic policies of Mao proved detrimental, he worked closely with President Liu Shaoqi to institute economic reforms that moderated the radical elements of the previous economic policies. However, with the Cultural Revolution and its resurgence of Mao, Deng was in a dangerous situation for being identified by the Red Guard as a critic of Mao. Following the arrest of Shaoqi, Deng faced more aggressive hostility and attacks by the Red Guard. The Red Guard also attacked his children and family. Finally, Deng was denounced and purged from his positions in the national government, though he was not arrested. Instead Deng will work as a factory worker away from central politics."
 CulRevPurge.3.d:0 "The former President of China, Liu Shaoqi was arrested today for being a secret capitalist working to betray the revolution and guide China towards a bourgeoisie society. Shaoqi rose to prominence over an economic reform campaign which saw China mitigate the more radical economic theories of Mao. He also agreed with Mao over the need for a Cultural Revolution to root out corruption and end an overly centralized, bureaucratic structure. However, soon after he inaugurated the Cultural Revolution, the movement spiraled out of his control and power returned to Mao. Because of his previous criticism of Mao and his high standing in the party, Shaoqi was an early target of the radicals in the party who have grown powerful enough to imprison him."
 HyperCulRev.3.d:0 "The remote regions of Xinjiang and Tibet are not only physically far from the Chinese homeland but are also ideologically and culturally distant. The people there lack a revolutionary spirit and cling on to their traditional religious and cultural identities. In order to confront this, Mao has directed the Red Guard to enter those provinces and begin their continuous revolution. Religious sites and texts will be targeted. The wearing of cultural clothes and backwards practices will also be purged from these provinces. Any who resist will be arrested for reactionary thoughts. Soon, with the help of the Red Guard, these places will remove the shackles of their past and become a living organ of the revolution."
 HyperCulRev.4.d:0 "The Soviet Union abandoned its commitment to proper revolutionary Marxist-Leninism. This led to the Sino-Soviet Split and the Cultural Revolution is meant to ensure the revolutionary state never ceases. With our recent successes and expansion in efforts to implement continuous revolution, the Chines Communist Party announced plans to send representatives to several Eastern European communist states to promote our principles and support the anti-revisionist factions. The continued success of the Cultural Revolution continues to demonstrate that China is at the vanguard of revolutionary politics and must work to spread its message to workers across the world."
 BeijingSpring.5.d:0 "Mao Zedong and his supporters, despite their revolutionary zeal and great accomplishments in establishing the party in China, had unfortunately caused major economic hardship in recent years. Although their intentions were for the best, they had failed to anticipate the consequences of their actions. In addition, they are quite uncomfortable with the recent opening up of public discourse on the state. President Shaoqi has planned reforms and actions that will alleviate the hardship on the people and better connect them to the state, this Maoist old guard stands in the way. To resolve issue, Shaoqi announced the sacking of Maoists across the party in response to their previous failures and public criticisms. These officials will be stripped of their national appointments. Shaoqi made sure to ensure Mao himself is not being targeted or directly criticized during this purge."
 PRC_Japan.1.d:0 "In the 1930s the Sino-Japanese War brought untold hardship to the people of China, laying waste to cities and costing millions of lives due to violence and famine. The wounds of that and earlier conflicts have not healed. In recent weeks, across China, many have taken to the street to denounce Japan as an American puppet bent on overthrowing the revolution and unrepentant to its war crimes against the Chinese people. In accordance to the wishes of the people, President Shaoqi announced the deportation of all Japanese citizens from China, including those from the World War II Imperial Japanese Army who stayed after the war. Even if some of them helped our cause, it does not make up for the pain and suffering the people endured. Tokyo is said to be furious by our decision. China will also downgrade its diplomatic mission in Japan."
 BeijingSpring.2.d:0 "The Chinese Communist Party announced it has removed Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong, from her national party positions effective immediately. This purge emphasizes how much power President Shaoqi has accumulated recently at the expense of Mao and his political allies. Jiang, a former actress and arts director spearheaded a campaign of purging non-revolutionary art and media. She acts as the personal secretary of Mao and maintains strong ties with his closest political allies. The Party cited new evidence of her bourgeoisie past that she had hidden from the party as the reason for her removal from politics."
 BeijingSpring.4.d:0 "Lin Biao is among the greatest military commanders in the PLA, having fought in all the PLA conflicts from 1925 to 1945. After the war ended he was promoted to Marshal and eventually joined the Politburo where he formed an alliance with Mao. He remains highly popular and respected within the PLA. For President Shaoqi this makes him a dangerous threat as the PLA could thwart his reforms and restore Maoists to power. To neutralize this threat, President Shaoqi had his political allies in the PLA claim Lin was seeking power for himself. With this accusation, the Marshal was removed from his political positions until a resolution to the accusations can be confirmed. The removal of Lin Biao will allow Shaoqi to put his supporters in the PLA to more senior posts and keep the PLA away from political power."
 BeijingSpring.6.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping recently helped publish a history of the early Chinese Communist Party by the Central Committee. The document is meant to preserve the legacy of Mao but also endorse the reforms being initiated by President Shaoqi. The history claims the accomplishments of Mao are immense, especially in the early decades of the party and in his military tactics. However, it notes mistakes were also made though they do not detract from his achievements. The document also blamed the close confidants of Mao for steering him wrong and blames them for the mistakes he made, basically absolving Mao of virtually any direct fault. Deng himself noted that Mao was Seven Parts Good, Three Parts Bad. This exemplifies the stance of the party that Mao is to be revered and respected, but that reforms and shifts away from his doctrine are perfectly acceptable."
 Mao_Return.1.d:0 "Mao Zedong has been taking advantage of the recent collapse of society to attempt to reverse his loss of power! Although he has retained the Chairmanship of the CPC, one of the most influential roles in [PRC.GetNameDef], Mao has maintained little influence since his disastrous Great Leap Forward. Now, it appears that the rhetoric in his Little Red Book was a tool to reverse this by inciting an army of young revolutionaries that will cling to his every word! Already, the Chairman has been accusing leading members of the CPC and the government of being counterrevolutionaries seeking to bring capitalist decadence to China."

 Mao_Return.4.d:0 "After several attempts to use young and impressionable revolutionaries to regain power, the Chairman and former President Mao Zedong has been forced into permanent retirement by CPC leadership. After the catastrophic famine following his attempt jumpstart Chinese industry and agriculture with the Great Leap Forward, Mao stepped down from his role as the Chairman of the People’s Republic of China and simply maintained his position as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China. However, his role in the recent chaos caused by young upstarts came as an attack on the party as well as the leaders of [PRC.GetNameDef], especially Chairman [PRC.GetLeader]. The former Chairman is now permanent house arrest at a state owned residence in Beijing. Though he will doubtlessly be remembered as a heroic figure in proletariat history, he will spend the rest of his life on the sidelines of the revolution."
#[He is but a relic of old wars.]
 ZhenbaoConflict.3.d:0 "A group of Chinese Soldiers has ambushed KGB Border Guards stationed in Zhenbao and has seized the Island. The politburo is in chaos as what should be done in response. Many have argued against any extreme retaliation such as a nuclear strike or anything that could lead to all out war. Most have advocated for a stern retaliation to take the island back from the Chinese. Some members have proposed a treaty to give the Island to the PRC to avoid the crisis. While others point out that letting the Chinese undermine Soviet authority could erode Soviet authority over other independent communist nations. A few of the more extreme Soviets of the Politburo claim this is the perfect opportunity to seize China thus letting the Soviets become the one and only banner of authority for Communism. The Soviet Armed Forces are also prepared for any order for retaliation against the Chinese. Ultimately however the decision of what should be done is up to the Secretary General."
 ZhenbaoConflict.2.d:0 "Our soldiers in Heilongjiang province have struck decisively. The few and relatively lightly equipped border guards on Zhenbao island were taken totally by surprise, and the disputed island is now under Chinese control. From what we can observe, the Politburo appears to be in a momentary state of paralysis. Hard liners in Soviet Government are doubtless recommending an escalation, possibly even a large conventional or nuclear attack, but there are also some indications the Soviets might be willing to reach a negotiated settlement. The Soviet Armed Forces have gone on alert in their far eastern territories, and our own forces are prepared to meet them, should they choose further escalation. A blow struck to the Soviets in Zhenbao may ripple throughout the communist world, potentially weakening Soviet control over the communist bloc."
 GLP.100.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader]’s plan to turn [PRC.GetNameDef] from an agrarian society into a pinnacle of communist might has not gone as intended. With the lofty goal to surpass the imperialists in [ENG.GetNameDef] in only fifteen years, [PRC.GetLeader] declared mass collectivization of industry and agriculture through backyard pig iron furnaces and intensive state projects on crops. Though there was little to no backlash to these plans at the conference discussing it in Lushan, the drastic consequences on the Chairman’s plans have made themselves clear. Crop yields in the first year were drastically lower than expected due to a redistribution of workers and catastrophic locust swarms that emerged in the wake of the misguided Four Pests Campaign. Further, these lower yields were recorded at record highs due to fear scrutiny of central authorities, meaning a nonexistent grain surplus was taken from peasants who needed it to survive. In the course of the plan, upwards of thirty million have died across [PRC.GetNameDef], the [PRC.GetAdj]’s economy has crashed, and hostility towards the government has reached an unprecedented high."
#[We can rebuild from this failure!]
 Cultural_Rev.4.d:0 "In May of 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong called an "expanded session" of the Politburo, the group that oversees the CPC. In an unexpected move, the session was laden with Maoist political rhetoric of class struggle, as well as attacks on current and former party leaders. Further, on May 16th, Mao released a document with sweeping claims that the bourgeoisie have snuck into "the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture" in order to sabotage the socialist cause and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This notification to all of China appears to be a justification of sorts, of an attack on hidden counterrevolutionaries within China."
#[There is a storm coming…]  May 16 Notification //triggers Cultural_Rev.2 global event
 Cultural_Rev.200.d:0 "Although it is doubtless that Chairman Mao had good intentions with his Great Leap Forward, his five year plan has ended in utter catastrophe. In his attempts to overhaul agricultural and industrial production in the fledgling [PRC.GetName], he has dealt irreparable damage to our great nation. Although the government has done its best to cover up the results of his calamitous policies, outrage over both the mass famines, violence, and the overall collapse of the economy are being directed at the Chairman. Although he has already been forced to abandon his "Great Leap," many in the party are debating forcing Mao to step down from the Presidency of [PRC.GetNameDef], and even from the Chairmanship of [PRC.GetRulingParty]. Though he proved his merits in the People's War of Liberation, his failures have forced our hand."

 Cultural_Rev.1.d:0 "Jiang Qing, former actress and esteemed spouse of our glorious leader [PRC.GetLeader] has asserted control over the Beijing Opera. One of the last vestiges of the decadent Qing Dynasty, this antiquated form of opera has displayed itself to be feudalistic and bourgeois, something that must be rooted out if we are to abide by the new standards of the proletariat. These operas are having their themes steadily replaced to ensure proper assertion of revolutionary and modern ideals. Jiang Qing’s eight new model operas tell stories of glorious revolutionary struggle against foreign and class enemies. Further, they tell tales of our leader [PRC.GetLeader] forging the way for socialism in our great nation. This inspired art enforces our ideals in the fight against the bourgeois."
#[Another step towards crushing the counterrevolutionaries!]
 Cultural_Rev.3.d:0 "Following Chairman Mao Zedong’s departure from the Presidency of [PRC.GetNameDef], his former protege Liu Shaoqui assumed the role of president. However, friction between the two leaders over the Great Leap Forward have culminated in massive sparks that are are slowly being stoked into a roaring blaze. Mao Zedong has formally condemned President Shaoqi as a class enemy attempting to steer the revolution towards Capitalism, and has thusly had him stripped of all roles, beaten, and put under house arrest for his crimes against the people of China."

 Red_Guard.1.d:0 "The youths have risen up! Inspired by the rhetoric of Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, hordes of schoolchildren have taken it upon themselves to purge counterrevolutionary elements from [PRC.GetNameDef], and make China Maoist from inside out. These youths are attacking anything and everything counterrevolutionary. Already, criticism of Maoist plays have been attacked, and schoolteachers have even been intimidated and attacked due to their lectures and pasts in the Nationalist Army. Although the Red Guards have been heavily resisted by many elements within China, they have received personal support from Chairman Mao Zedong."
#[Long live Chairman Mao!] The Rise of the Red Guards (local)
 Red_Guard.2.d:0 "The Red Guard have come into the spotlight again! The revolutionary youths have begun an attack on Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Ideas following an editorial encouraging the destruction of these anti-proletarian ideas in the newspaper the People’s Daily. In the past few weeks, the Red Guard have forced shop and street names to change and attacked any who oppose the revolution. Further, they have begun a campaign of mass destruction, destroying traditional Chinese architecture, literature, art, temples, and even cemeteries and Imperial tombs. Though prominent officials have stepped in to prevent the continuation of the campaign, a great amount of work has been done to stifle oppression from the past."
#[Maybe they have gone too far?] Four Olds Campaign
 Red_Guard.3.d:0 "The Red Guards have been facing a steady collapse following several incidents. Several times, the Red Guards found themselves in direct and bloody conflict against the People’s Liberation Army, storming PLA areas at the encouragement of Chairman Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing. The youths have further stormed areas of productions and found themselves in conflict with factory workers and farmers who wish to maintain the status quo. Conflicts in the government over whether to support or suppress have further added to the confusion, and now the formerly united front has collapsed into factionalism and infighting between different factions."
#[Something must be done!] Chaos within the Red Guards!
 Red_Guard.4.d:0 "Following the CPC’s declaration of student radicalism as counterrevolutionary, moves have been made to suppress the Red Guard through both politics and military force. Those youths who took part in the revolution have heard from the mouth of the Chairman that the movement has ended. Now, many students are being sent to the countryside for reeducation and rehabilitation through work and rural poverty. The Red Guard is dead."
