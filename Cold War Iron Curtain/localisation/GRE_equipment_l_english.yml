 GRE_cargo_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The CH-47 (originally HC-1B) is a twin-engine, tandem-rotor helicopter that is among the heaviest lifting helicopters of the West. Replacing the CH-37 Mojave, the CH-47 possesses several means of loading various cargo, including multiple doors across the fuselage, a wide loading ramp located at the rear of the fuselage, and a total of three external ventral cargo hooks to carry underslung loads. It was also the fastest helicopter among its contemporaries when introduced in 1962, and is still considered one of the fastest choppers in the U.S. Army's arsenal currently. Its name, 'Chinook', is from the Native American Chinook people of modern-day Washington state."

 GRE_cargo_helicopter_equipment_3_short:0 "CH-47D Chinook"
 GRE_cargo_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The CH-47D shares the same airframe as earlier models, the main difference being the adoption of more powerful engines. Early CH-47Ds were originally powered by two T55-L-712 engines, the most common engine is the later T55-GA-714A. With its triple-hook cargo system, the CH-47D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to 26,000 lb (12,000 kg) (such as 40-foot or 12-metre containers) externally. It was first introduced into service in 1979. In air assault operations, it often serves as the principal mover of the 155 mm M198 howitzer, accompanying 30 rounds of ammunition, and an 11-man crew."

 GRE_scout_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The upgraded 'D' variant of the Kiowa was the result of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). It came with features such as an upgraded transmission and engine for the chopper's nap-of-the-earth (extreme low level) flights, as well as a unique four-bladed main rotor configuration which allowed it to be much quieter than other helicopters, more so its predecessors. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the rotor system, and a mixed glass cockpit, with traditional instruments identified as "standby" for emergency use."

A typical (and famous) mission loadout is known to be its 30mm Chain gun carried between the landing gear, and four stub-wing hardpoints for a mixture of Hydra rocket pods and AGM-114 Hellfire Anti-Tank Missiles. Nicknamed the 'Apache,' the AH-64 represents the pinnacle of helicopter aviation."

It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US.."
