 LBA_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Carcano is the frequently used name for a series of Italian bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating military rifles and carbines. Introduced in 1891, this rifle was chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Carcano round (Cartuccia Modello 1895). It was developed by the chief technician Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1890, and was originally called the Modello (model) 91 or simply M91."

 LBA_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 LBA_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well.

A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area.

However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories.

 LBA_scout_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Introduced in 1969 during the height of the Vietnam War, the OH-58 was a 4-seated helicopter whose noteworthy feature was that, despite having 2 pilots, the pilot controls on the left seat can be removed to carry a passenger up front. During the Vietnam War, its armament was a single M134 minigun or M129 Grenade Launcher. Post-war, the OH-58 would receive many modifications, with an engine upgrade (bringing it up to par with the later OH-58C), a thermal imaging system, a communications package for law enforcement, enhanced navigational equipment and high skid gear. These upgraded variants of the 'Kiowa' (named for a Native American tribe originally from Montana and Colorado) would take part in the Army National Guard's RAID Anti-Drug operations."
