 JOR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

 JOR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

 JOR_infantry_equipment_3:0 "United States Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2"
 JOR_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "M16A2"
 JOR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "After the frequent unreliability of the weapon in the jungles of Vietnam, the US marine corps requested a redesign of the weapon. In 1982 the redesign and improvements were made. The weapon featured a strengthened receiver, new rifling, a strengthened case, better cooling as a result of different materials, improved support for attachables, and a redesigned internal mechanism that gave it a high level of reliability. It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

 JOR_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "M4 Carbine"
 JOR_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M4 carbine is a further improvement on the M16A2. It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."
