The gunman killed has been identified as Griselio Torresola. The other gunman has been captured and identified as Oscar Collazo. The motive behind this attempted assassination was that these gunmen were Puerto Rican nationalists who wants Puerto Rico to be free of American imperialism, and wanted to set a point by killing the US President. The nation is mourning today. Vice President Alben W. Barkley has been sworn into being the 34th President of the United States of America."

President Truman is fine and hasn't been injured. 1 of the gunmen was killed in the fighting. He has been identified as Griselio Torresola. The other gunman has been captured and identified as Oscar Collazo. The motive behind this attempted assassination was that these gunmen were Puerto Rican nationalists who wants Puerto Rico to be free of American imperialism, and wanted to set a point by killing the US President. Luckily President Truman is fine."
 soviet.4.d:0 "The USSR has annexed the Karelo-Finnish SSR into the Russian Federative SSR. This is the first time a Soviet Republic has been annexed into another. The USSR stated that after increased Finnish-Soviet relations, they though it would be time to annex the Karelo-Finnish SSR. There is however a few people angry at the move. The Finnish population in the once SSR has been afraid of more Soviet control and less autonomy for them. The Soviets have stated that the Finnish should not be worried. The Soviets have been celebrating the new oblasts into the RFSSR in Moscow."
 soviet.3.d:0 "After a decade of World War II and improvement of relations with Finland, members of congress have declared that it is time for the Karelo-Finnish SSR to be annexed into the USSR. We also need the land for the border with Norway and Sweden in case we need to launch an invasion or defend. However some of the Finnish political leaders in the congress have wanted to keep it a SSR for the Finnish people in the area. What should we do? Do we accept Finlandization or not?"
 soviet.2.d:0 "The USSR has authorized the Russian Federative SSR to give the gift of Crimea to the Ukraine SSR as their friendship for over 300 years. Ukraine joined the Tsardom of Russia 300 years ago, and the RFSSR wanted to show their appreciation for their historical friendship. The Ukrainian SSR has said that they thank the RSFSSR for this gift of friendship."
 soviet.1.d:0 "As we reach the 300th anniversary of Ukraine becoming a part of the Tsardom of Russia, more and more people have started talking about what shall we do for the Ukrainian SSR and their anniversary. Some of the political leaders in our congress have started to talk about a transfer of Crimea from the Russian Federative SSR to the Ukrainian SSR. We have always been very close to the Ukrainians and they have said that this land belongs to them. This could be the perfect gift for their friendship with us for over 300 years. However the land is very valuable and has plenty of ports and resources for us."
 swf.4.d:0 "Our glorious Premier, Joseph Stalin, was found dead in his bed this morning. After an incident 4 days ago with him having a blood vessel pop in his brain, he was sent to the hospital. However our Premier was strong and didn't want any medical help. He was sent home and his wife, Svetlana, wanted him to have treatment. So Stalin took his wife's advice and got treatment. However this morning his body was discovered in his bed. He died while he was asleep. Early reports said he died of a stroke. There will, of course, be a very calm and friendly debate in the Soviet as to who will be the next Premier. We will surely miss our glorious and all powerful Premier, Joesph Stalin. He guided the country through hard times."
 news.1500.t:0 "It is with deep grief that at March 5th at 9:50 pm, Josef Vissarionovich Stalin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, died after a serious illness. The heart of the collaborator and follower of the genius of Lenin's work, the wise leader and teacher of the Communist party and of the Soviet people, stopped beating. Joseph Stalin was a hard worker and helped his fellow comrades. His bright vision of the U.S.S.R. helped form a lot of the ideals and values we have today. He carried on Lenin's legacy. He will be missed. The Soviet Council will convene and decide who the successor will be. Whoever will it be, they will have to follow one of the greatest legacies of the U.S.S.R."
 swf.7.d:0 "Today we all gather in Warsaw, Poland to reaffirm our desire of for an establishment of a collective European security based alliance irrespective of our social or political systems. The Cold War has gotten worse over the years and more lines are being drawn. Now with the rearming of the German states we need to make sure we are prepare for a full armed conflict erupting in the German region or elsewhere. The Cominform has been a great alliance, but we need to strengthen the East against the West. The Warsaw Pact shall be created to protect any members no matter their social or political systems. We shall be united against the enemies of the Warsaw Pact. The Cominform is dead! Long live the Warsaw Pact!"
 swf.9.d:0 "After a conference in Warsaw, Poland, the Eastern Bloc and other Soviet allies signed a national defense and alliance treaty. They disbanded the Cominform and formed the Warsaw Pact as its replacement. The Soviets said that due to the higher tensions and the rearming of the Germans, a stronger alliance is needed to protect the countries in the East against the West. NATO has made a statement saying that will still fight the Communist threat no matter what and that this changes nothing. Tensions are still high in Europe and now have gotten escalated due to this 'new' military alliance."

 prc.50.d:0 "Mao Zedong announced in Beijing today that he would be stepping down today as Premier of the People’s Republic of China. He stated that it is time for retirement and wished to spend more time with the people. Some of Mao’s supporters stated that he was forced down after some of his reforms for being too radical. They would hunt down the anti-Maoists until China is pure again. The next leader of the Chinese people will be announced soon."
 prc.85.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping has been removed from his positions as Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and other political position. Mao Zedong said in his speech today that Deng has been imprisoned for being being a counter-revolutionary and in his role of anti-government acts against the Party leadership. Mao Zedong’s campaign against reformists and anti-Maoists continue as part of his “Cultural Revolution”. Many cheered as Mao continued on his speech and the removal of Deng. Many of Mao’s critics have stated that Deng was removed only because he was a critic of Mao, and that he wanted a more liberal China. Mao’s Cultural Revolution continues as China returns to its true self."
 prc.75.d:0 "Lin Biao, one of our closest allies and generals, has crashed and died while trying to defect to the U.S.S.R. It seems he was the leader of Project 571. Project 571 is the Codename for our beloved leader, Mao Zedong, be assassinated and then a coup would be launched against the Party leadership. Any of Pro-Mao Forces would be removed or executed. However, several of our officials have discovered the plot and tried to arrest him. He escaped with his family, but while over Mongolia he crashed due to a fuel malfunction. With reports found in his office of the Soviets offering to support his coup and his leadership, this makes us question if the Soviets are really on our side. We must be on the watch for anymore dissents in our government." 
 prc.86.d:0 "Liu Shaqoi has been imprisoned by Mao Zedong after Mao Zedong said in another speech that Shaqoi was arrested for being a traitor to the government and the party. Mao stated that Shaqoi was a supporter of Capitalism and wanted to undermine the Chinese people for the betterment of himself. Shaqoi has also been accused of supporting acts of terrorism against the Chinese government. Many of Mao’s critics have stated that this is another way for Mao to gain more power and remove any opposition to him. Mao has revealed that more of his “Cultural Revolution” policies will continue and grow to remove any traitors within the government. "
