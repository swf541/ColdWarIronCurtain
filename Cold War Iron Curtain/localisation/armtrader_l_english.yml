 CAP_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "L1A1 SLR"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The L1A1 SLR is a British version of the Belgian FN FAL battle rifle. It was produced under license and has seen use in numerous Commonwealth nations. The United Kingdom produced its own variant of the FN FAL incorporating the modifications developed by the Allied Rifle Committee, designating it the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR). The weapons were manufactured by the Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield, Birmingham Small Arms, Royal Ordnance Factory and ROF Fazakerley. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by Parker Hale Limited. The SLR served the British Armed Forces from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the L85A1 from 1985 onwards."

 CAP_infantry_equipment_2:0 "United States Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "M16"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

 CAP_infantry_equipment_3:0 "United States Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "M16A2"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "After the frequent unreliability of the weapon in the jungles of Vietnam, the US marine corps requested a redesign of the weapon. In 1982 the redesign and improvements were made. The weapon featured a strengthened receiver, new rifling, a strengthened case, better cooling as a result of different materials, improved support for attachables, and a redesigned internal mechanism that gave it a high level of reliability. It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

 CAP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "M4 Carbine"
 CAP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M4 carbine is a further improvement on the M16A2. It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."

 CAP_lt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M24 Chaffee is a light tank developed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1944 close to the end of WWII Electric Boogaloo. The M24 has 38mm of armor and a 75mm main gun. The engine is a V8 twin Cadillac with a Hydramatic transmission that can move roughly the same as the M5 Stuart. In combat, the M5 Stuart's small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign. It was short after this that the M24 Chaffee was developed with the intention of giving it more firepower to better serve its role."
 CAP_lt_equipment_3:0 "Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 76-mm gun, M41"
 CAP_lt_equipment_3_short:0 "M41 Walker Bulldog"
 CAP_lt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The M41 is a light recon tank developed by Cadillac in 1949. It saw combat in Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, Lebanon, and Somalia. Its armor ranges from 19mm to 31.7mm. It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

The armor is an aluminum hull with a steel turret. It was immediately rushed into service in Vietnam because of its mobility and versatility where it served an exceptional role. The 152mm main gun can launch an ATGM or conventional ammunition respectively. The M551 was criticized by many of its operators due to the difficulty of use in direct combat but still served its role effectively despite its poor reputation."
 CAP_lt_equipment_5:0 "M3 Bradley"
 CAP_lt_equipment_5_short:0 "M3 Bradley"
 CAP_lt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The M3 Bradley CFV is very similar to the M2 Bradley IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) and is fielded with the same two-man 25mm Bushmaster Cannon turret with a coaxial M240C 7.62mm machine gun. It only varies from the M2 in a few subtle ways and by role. The M3 is classified as an armored reconnaissance and scout vehicle and does away with the firing ports found in the M2 series. The M3 also carries more TOW missiles as well as more ammunition for its 25mm and 7.62mm guns."
 CAP_lt_equipment_6:0 "M3A2 Bradley ODS"
 CAP_lt_equipment_6_short:0 "M3A2 Bradley ODS"
 CAP_lt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The M3A2 incorporated enhanced armor upgrades, such as the ability to mount explosive reactive armor, from the M2A2 Bradley.

 CAP_ht_equipment_2:0 "T26E4 Super Pershing"
 CAP_ht_equipment_2_short:0 "T26E4 Super Pershing"
 CAP_ht_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Super Pershing was a heavier variant of the basic M26. Heavier armor was strapped to the tank and the longer T15E1 gun replaced the M3 gun in an effort to match the King Tiger firepower."
 CAP_ht_equipment_3:0 "T32"
 CAP_ht_equipment_3_short:0 "T32"
 CAP_ht_equipment_3_desc:0 "Work began in early 1945 to develop a significantly heavier variant of the M26 Pershing. Using data collected from the T29 Heavy Tank project and incorporating an experimental 90mm main gun firing armor-piercing, composite rigid ammunition as well as a more advanced transmission, the first T32 tank was produced. The T15E2 gun mounted on this tank was much more powerful than the gun mounted on the Pershing, and similar to the T26E4 Super Pershing which utilized a similar experimental 90mm, the counterweight at the back of the turret was enlarged substantially to offset the long gun's weight."
 CAP_ht_equipment_4:0 "120mm Gun Combat Tank M103"
 CAP_ht_equipment_4_short:0 "M103"
 CAP_ht_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M103 was a heavy tank created in 1957 by Chrysler. 100 units were built and deployed but did not actually see combat. It featured 127-254mm armor and had a 120mm main gun with 3 secondary MGs. It had a maximum speed of 21 mph and an operational range of 80 using 280 gallons in this time. The engine was a AV1790 12-cylinder gasoline engine. The tank itself served in the marine corps but didn't see combat as the units it was deployed to never got to use it."
 CAP_ht_equipment_5:0 "120mm Gun Combat Tank M103A2"
 CAP_ht_equipment_5_short:0 "M103A2"
 CAP_ht_equipment_5_desc:0 "The M103A2 is an improvement to the M103 made in the 60s by Chrysler. 200 units were created but it did not see combat. It replaced the M103's engine with an AVDS1790-2 V12 twin turbocharged engine, granting it significant advantages over the M103. The improved engine could carry it 295 miles at 23 mph and had significant mobility using the same fuel as the M103. There were also some minor other improvements made to the parts of the M103 such as a slightly different model of transmission but was ultimately the same. The M103A2 was the last heavy tank created by the US because main battle tanks supplanted the need for heavy tanks and could carry more firepower with less weight and more mobility."

 CAP_sht_equipment_1_:0 "T95 GMC"
 CAP_sht_equipment_1_short:0 "T95 Gun Motor Carriage"
 CAP_sht_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T95 Gun Motor Carriage is a super heavy bunker destroyer developed in 1945 by the Pacific Car and Foundry. It never saw combat and only 2 prototypes were created. It weighs 95 tons and is 36x14x9 ft large needing a crew of 4 individuals. The armor is 1ft thick in every part and used a GAF V-8 engine. The tank uses 2 tracks and a horizontal volute spring suspension. The T95 is equipped with a 105mm main gun and has a M2 Browning secondary armament. It was initially designed to break through German defenses and was later considered for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. Production was already planned but the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs ended the war and the project was cancelled before a unit could be manufactured."
 CAP_sht_equipment_2_short:0 "Chrysler K"
 CAP_sht_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Chrysler K is a super heavy tank designed by Chrysler in 1946 by Chrysler. Only 2 prototypes were created. The tank's weight, engine, and exact dimensions are unknown. The Chrysler K featured a 105mm main gun with 2 secondary MGs. Unlike the T95, the Chrysler K only had 1 set of ultrawide tracks. The Chrysler K was eventually cancelled as the project went over-budget."
 CAP_sht_equipment_3_short:0 "R-32"
 CAP_sht_equipment_3_desc:0 "The R32 is an experimental nuclear superheavy tank designed by Chrysler in the 50s. The R32 never reached prototype phase but some parts were manufactured. The R32 was designed to carry a nuclear powered electric engine and a 120mm main gun with 3 secondary MGs. The nuclear engine was estimated to give it a speed of 40 mph and an almost limitless travelling range as a result of nuclear power being its source of fuel. The armor was designed to be 127-254mm thick. The project was cancelled quickly after its inception due to a large number of hangups in the lack of technology needed to create the design and skepticism on behalf of the US General Staff in charge of funding the project."

 CAP_mbt_equipment_0:0 "M4 Sherman"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_0_short:0 "M4 Sherman"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M4 Sherman is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1940 for WWII. It was lend leased to many different countries starting from 1940. The Sherman can wield a 75mm, 76mm or 105mm main gun and typically had a browning secondary gun. It is propelled by a C4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine capable of transporting the vehicle at 22-30 mph over 100-150 miles before needing refueling. It was reliable, cheap to produce, and a logician's wet dream. It was very compact and easy to transport in large numbers which made shipping the vehicle across the Atlantic extremely easy. The M4 was also very versatile and was capable of operating in a large variety of conditions."
 CAP_mbt_equipment_1:0 "M26"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_1_short:0 "M26 Pershing"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M26 Pershing is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1944. It saw combat in WWII and in the Korean war. The M26 Pershing is notably heavy for a medium tank with an exceptionally poor off-road speed as a result of this. Its 8-cylinder Ford GAF engine could carry it up to 100 miles at 30 mph on road but off-road it clocks at 5.25 mph. Its main gun is a 90mm cannon and can wield a M2 browning. However, during the Korean war the .50 caliber M2 browning was swapped for 2 M1919 .30-06 guns due to the large quantity of soft targets in the field and the need to carry 9x the ammunition rather than more firepower. The M26 may have been a medium tank, but it is extremely heavy and can be considered to be a hybrid medium/heavy tank."
 CAP_mbt_equipment_2:0 "M46 Patton"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_2_short:0 "M46 Patton"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M46 Patton is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1949. It saw combat in the Korean War and was designed to replace the M26 Pershing due to its inordinate weight. It features a 90mm main gun and 102mm armor. It can be equipped with a single M2 Browning or dual M1919 Brownings. The M46 Patton uses a V12 twin-turbo engine that clocks up to 15-30 mph and has an operational range of 30-80 miles. It was heavily mass produced in an attempt to replace the former designs. It was in date with modern designs and weapons and did not suffer from heavy weight."

 CAP_mbt_equipment_4_short:0 "M48 Patton"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M48 Patton is a MBT designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1953. The M48 has 110mm of armor and an improved 90mm main gun. The engine is an optimized variant of the V12 used in prior Patton tanks with a light fuel injection system and is supercharged. It has an operation range off-road of 160 miles and 300 miles on-road. It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."
 CAP_mbt_equipment_5:0 "Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_5_short:0 "M60 Patton"
 CAP_mbt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The M60 Patton is a MBT designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1960. It was used in the Yom Kippur War, the Invasion of Grenada, Yemen, and Lebanon. It has approximately 220mm of armor and carries a 105mm main gun. It typically used the M73 7.62x51mm machine gun as its secondary armament. The engine is an improved V12 twin-turbo engine that can move about the same speed as the M48. However, despite weighing slightly more than the M48, the M60 can move about the same speed and across the same difference. The M60 underwent many different minor changes throughout its life and has approximately 4 variants as a result of this. This meant increases in the armor, the weight and improvements to reliability."

 CAP_mbt_equipment_8_desc:0 "The M1A2 Abrams is an improvement made to the M1 by GDLS in the early 80s. The tank uses a depleted uranium mesh-reinforced composite armor measuring about 600mm. The tanks also come with optional additions such as reactive armor, an urban survival kit, and a remotely operated weapon system. It has a 120mm main smoothbore gun and outranges most other tanks. It also has improved electronics, ATGM countermeasures, and a firefighting system. However, no improvements to the transmission, suspension, or engine were made and as such, sits closer to the ground and weighs significantly more. It can move on road at 42 mph or off road at 25 mph with a shorter operational range. It has been used in Afghanistan, the Gulf, and Iraq where it has demonstrated unparalleled survivability against most anti-tank weapons that its opponents have fielded."

The M2 Bradley project was intended to create a new generation of PCs for the modern era complete with NBC protection. The project started in the late 60s and went through numerous prototypes to reach where it is now. The Bradley uses a VTA-903T 8-cylinder engine and has torsion bar suspension. The Bradley is armed with a 25mm autocannon and an anti-tank TOW attachment. BAE was tasked to create an infantry transport that was bae. Taking inspiration from the prototypes of the MICV project, the Bradley is capable of reconnaissance and support for the infantry that it carriers. Although it has aluminum armor, its firepower and mobility is used to protect itself in the field."

Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."

The R-36M began development in the late 1970s, and at the fall of the USSR, there were 308 launch silos for the missile, each holding at least 2. Some R-36Ms are still in service today."

 CUM_icbm_equipment_4_desc:0 "The RT-23 was designed to be a multi-launch platform weapons system, capable of firing from a silo and rail car. It was tested throughout the early 80's, and deployed in 1987. The RT-23's operational range was 11000Km, and it could carry 10 550Kt MIRVs. In September 1991, about 90 were deployed, and when the Soviet Union collapsed, the production facility was shut down."

 CUM_cruisemissile_equipment_0_desc:0 "In October 1944, piqued by V-1 and V-2 rockets, Stalin assigned Vladimir Chelomey to research and design a similar weapon. Chelomey's 1st attempt was a reverse engineered V-1 called the 10kh, powered by the same engine as a V-1. The 14kh was a revised and improved version, with stabilizers and wings, as well as a better overall structural design, and a larger operational range."

It could go farther, had a larger warhead, was more stable, and had a more powerful Chelomey D-6 engine. It still was a very early and rudimentary design in the cruise missile field, however."

 CUM_cruisemissile_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Burya was a supersonic,intercontinental cruise missile 1st developed in 1954. It could go 6000Km at mach 3 with a small bomb sized warhead, running on a two stage engine comprised of a rocket booster and ramjet. However, the project was cancelled in 1960 due to the advantages of IR- and ICBMs, namely, greater simplicity and relative invulnerability to interception, which the La-350 did not possess."

First developed in the late 1960's, the RK-55 underwent test flights in 1976. Right as it was poised to enter service in 1987, it was banned under the guidelines set by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Reports from contemporary sources say that it has been converted to a conventional weapon and is still used by submarines today."
