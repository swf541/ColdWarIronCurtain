 Afghani_Coup.1.d:0 "The Hizb-i-Sirri Ittihad is the only political party within our country that actually aims to establish a republic. They are a very diverse group and was founded in the late 1940s. They believe that a republican government was the only way to end the discrimination of ethnicity and religion in Afghanistan. We have now detected the alleged plan of a coup d'état during our Nowruz celebration in March. How do we handle this? Their motivations are connected to the worldview of their leaders, and our ethnic policies and Pashtunistan issue."
 Afghani_Coup.2.d:0 "The Hizb-i-Sirri Ittihad have successfully executed a coup d'état, the monarchy has been deposed and we are establishing upcoming elections. Riots have broken out across the nation regarding the sudden regime change, and word is getting out onto the global stage of our recent actions. We have established a small provisional government with Ismael Balkhi at the helm before we hold elections and declare the first republic. Our top leaders are currently working on a new constitution that will include the principles of a republic. With party members across ethnic and sectarian lines, from all parts of our nation including north, west, and central, not only are we a democracy, but we are a diverse one representing all walks of life. No longer are we ruled by gods and kings, we are ruled by the principles of democracy so first made in ancient Greece. We shall rise from the ashes as the new Afghanistan."
 
 Afghanistan.1.d:0 "For the first time in many years, our Prime Minister, Shah Mahmud has allowed relatively free national assembly elections, and the resulting seventh Afghan Parliament shall be voted in, many parties that are running are much more moderate and liberal in their views, liberalism being a new ideology to come to the table in Afghanistan. A political philosophy originating in the west during the Age of Enlightenment. It is based on liberty, consent of the governed, and equality before the law . Many parties are planning on giving voice to criticism of our government, and traditional institutions, also allowing opposition political groups to come to life and planning on enacting liberal reforms such as freedom of the press."
 Afghanistan.2.d:0 "The Pashtunistan issue is one of the most important political developments in Afghanistan after World War II ended, the Durand Line was established after Afghanistan lost some territories to the east and south of Afghanistan that were inhabited by the Pashtuns in 1893. Since the 1947 Partition of India however, governments of Afghanistan have claimed the line was never meant to be an international boundary, and encouraged Pashtun communities to stage "excursions" across the border into their rightful territory, and such a disturbance has occurred when a group of Afghan Pashtun tribes invaded the Bogra pass, with the Afghan government denying that the invaders have comprised of Afghan troops. Due to the Afghan government's lack of cooperation, Pakistan has introduced a blockade on Afghanistan for trade and travel, but they are willing to negotiate to discuss economic and cultural questions of common concern to the two countries."

 HVA.1.d:0 "The Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA) based in Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan was established on December 4, 1952 as an agency of the Afghan Government. It was modelled on the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States, with a remit covering lands in Farah Province, Ghazni Province, Helmand Province, Herat Province, and Kandahar Province. The HAVA was created to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys, primarily through irrigation and agricultural land development along the Helmand River and the Arghandab River, in a plan which was forecast to be of primary importance to the future economy of Afghanistan."
 AFG_PM.1.d:0 "Shah Mahmud Khan's role as prime minister has brought a lot of our country in terms of progressive policies, such as free elections, but after his failed attempt at a highly ambitious irrigation scheme in western Afghanistan, severe economic decline in the last few months and tense relations with Pakistan, his time has come up and parliament has come up with a motion of no confidence, forcing his resignation. We now have a choice between Mohammed Daoud Khan, a progressive politician or Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar, who shall we choose?"
 SocDemAfg.1.d:0 "One of the major focuses of the prime minister was Shah Mahmud's experiment in greater political tolerance and liberalization. Encouraged by young, Western-educated members of the political elite, the prime minister allowed National Assembly elections that were distinctly less controlled than they had been in the past; the result was the "liberal parliament" of 1949. He tolerated the activity of opposition political groups. A newly formed student union not only provided a forum for political debate but also produced theatrical plays critical of Islam and the monarchy. Newspapers criticized the government, and many groups began demanding a more open political system. But the liberalization went farther than the prime minister or anyone could have intended, and so he began cracking down. The student union was dissolved in 1951; newspapers criticizing the government were closed down; many opposition leaders were jailed. The parliament that was elected in 1952 was a great step backwards from the one that had been elected in 1949. The brief experiment in open politics was over."
 AFG_REP.1.d:0 "The Hizb-i-Sirri Ittihad, led by Ismael Balkhi today, with the approval of the Loya jirga have written a new constitution, declaring the Republic of Afghanistan. The party and their paramilitary as well as fervent supporters seized power and established a republican government. Dedicated supporters of the previous government have been imprisoned or executed, policies are currently being submitted through parliament for debate regarding the equal treatment of all ethnic groups and religions within the country. Long live the Republic of Afghanistan!"

 USA_AFG.1.d:0 "Today, we were greeted by a US Air Force flight at our airport today, with none other than the President [USA.GetLeader], of the United States of America. He met with our King Mohammed Zahir Shah at the Tajbeg Palace. While the visit was an informal one, many things were discussed, including continued American diplomatic ties with the nation. May Allah bless our brothers in the west!"
 AFG_SOV.1.d:0 "Today we received a letter from Andrey Vyshinsky, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union. It states the Soviet's strong opposition to the UN mission in our nation, that it is the work of U.S. imperialists, that the whole thing is a ruse and the Americans are planning the construction of military roads and airfields near the border. It was sent to us shortly after a bill to nationalize the oil in the region by our seventh National Assembly and our invitation of a UN technical assistance mission to the country. They visited the Shibarghan area in the northwest, albeit very close to the border with the Soviets, there are rich oil deposits that have been discovered there. We will refute this note, don't they understand our economic success is dependent on motor transport, and all of the oil in our country is of strategic interest?"
 AFG_SOV.2.d:0 "Despite our beautifully written letter, the government of Afghanistan have seemingly rejected the letter Andrey Vyshinsky delivered regarding the imperialist United States and the United Nations in their involvement in the economy of Afghanistan. Perhaps we’re trying the wrong approach, instead of strongarming the Afghan government, how about we indulge them with money and weaponry? Perhaps this will bring them to our side. We will consider a shipment of weapons in the following year or so. But as for now, we will keep vigilant watch on our southern frontier."

 Afghanistan.10.d:0 "Today, the arrest of Mohammad Arif was conducted as well as of devout supporters, after a short trial he was found guilty of planning to stage a military takeover of the nation. Intelligence reports show that he had a large following within the National Assembly who would be willing to bend to his rule and would do anything he said, thankfully we uncovered this plot before anything could come from it, hopefully this keeps us stable and will dissuade any other officers from planning something of this caliber, let this be a fine example of what we do to traitors!"
 Afghanistan.3.d:0 "Today, we have decided to release Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pashtun independence activist, famed for his work in ending the rule of the British Raj in India, it's simply too much trouble to keep him interned in our nation, a lifelong pacifist and Muslim, he frequently demanded the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state named Pashtunistan, composing of all Pashtun territories of British India. With his new found freedom perhaps he can work in our favour to get Pashtuns currently living in Pakistan to fight on our side."

 Afghanistan.4.d:0 "Today, the King of our nation, his Majesty Mohammed Zahir Shah has delivered a powerful speech regarding the Pashtunistan issue, he demanded that Pashtunistan be reintegrated into Afghanistan, they are rightfully our people, and deserve to be governed by us and represented by us, not by the Pakistani government. Our king has a deep emotional commitment to it because his great-grandfather, Sardar Sultan Muhammad Khan, the brother of Emir Dost Muhammad Khan, had been the last Afghan ruler of Peshawar, when the Sikhs pushed him out in 1834 under Ranjit Singh. The unification of Pashtunistan with Afghanistan is of the utmost importance, that he will not rest, not until the day the Pashtuns are reunited with their homeland."

 AFG_IND.1.d:0 "Today we received a letter from the Afghan ambassador, marked highly confidential. It states that, while Pakistan focuses the majority of its troops in the west, that we should perform a surprise attack along the entire Pakistani border, to pressure them into peace negotiations, and once they have surrendered, in the ensuing peace deal we will receive all of Kashmir. Perhaps this can bring an end to our ongoing problem regarding the ownership of Kashmir."
 AFG_IND.2.d:0 "Despite the ambitiousness of our letter, we are surprised to hear that the Indian government accepted our proposal, that they should attack Pakistan to seize the Kashmir region while they are occupied fighting us, to bring about a sooner end to this war. Perhaps now we can reverse the mistake of the Durand Line and the division of the British Raj. We always knew we had friends in high places in the Indian government to help us win our war."

 AFG_IND.3.d:0 "Despite our strategic offer to the Indian government, that they should attack Pakistan and seize the hotly fought over Kashmir region. We are surprised to learn that our offer has been denied, who knew the Indian government was so inept at taking advantage of a good opportunity?"

 AFG_PAK.20.d:0 "Reports come back from an army field headquarters near the Pakistani border that we have conducted a successful raid against a military outpost in Pakistan, multiple Pakistani soldiers have been killed, and we have stolen any useful supplies. We doubt there will be any retaliation for this, we’ve made sure to leave no mark of our presence. A job well done by our boys on the ground, that’s for sure!"

 AFG_PAK.21.d:0 "Reports have been flooding in from one of our army forward operating bases near the Pakistani border that an excursion we conducted inside of Pakistan to disrupt military operations has failed, some men were killed and numerous are missing-in-action. This is an operational failure, and perhaps we should rethink our strategy going forward against the Pakistanis."
 AFG_PAK.22.d:0 "We have received an after action report from one of our most skilled commanders on the field on the Afghan border currently, it states that we have successfully staged a raid against the Afghan border, they failed to repulse our attack. During an attempt at building a border fence, we killed three soldiers and injured numerous others and demolished parts of a fence, well done!"
 AFG_PAK.23.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, and strategic planning, our border raid against an Afghan military outpost inside their country has failed, a majority of our soldiers were killed, or successfully retreated. Apparently word around the company that performed the attack is that they were expecting it, and had landmines and machine gun emplacements at the ready. Perhaps we should anticipate this kind of thing next time and hit back harder, let’s show those Afghans who is the boss around here!"

 #News Events
 Afghani_Coup.3.d:0 "Word has come from the Kingdom of Afghanistan, that they are no longer a kingdom. The previous Prime Minister Shah Mahmud Khan was executed today in downtown Kabul, his corpse was dumped in the streets. Afghanistan’s reigning monarch Mohammed Zahir Shah and the rest of the house of Barakzai’s status are unknown at this time, ending over 200 years of royal rule in Afghanistan. The political party, the Hizb-i-Sirri Ittihad, was responsible for the overthrow is led by a man named Ismael Balkhi, the motivations for the seizure of power are unknown as of right now, but one can assume that they are not happy with the authoritarian ways in the previous administration. All eyes are on the new government, and what actions they will undertake to improve the conditions of the people."
 Afghani_Coup.4.d:0 "Ismael Balkhi, a poet and well known political leader has been arrested alongside five other men who attempted a coup d'état on our king Mohammed Zahir Shah, as well as assassinating our Prime Minister. We have successfully intercepted communications regarding it and cracked down before it could take place. All members have been arrested are charged with conspiring to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. They were planning on executing it during our Nowruz celebration, to try and take us by surprise during the festivities. Long live the king!"
 CENTO.225.d:0 "After recent negotiations and détente with Pakistan. News from the Baghdad Pact’s press organization came out today that the newly formed Republic of Afghanistan have joined the alliance. The Baghdad Pact is a military alliance modeled after NATO, which the nations apart of the alliance are committed to mutual cooperation and protection. The goal of the organization is to contain the Soviet Union by having a line of strong states along the USSR's southern frontier."
 AFG_IND.4.d:0 "Today, an announcement from the Indian government was made, the declaration of war against Pakistan. The reasoning, that they are bringing stability to the region of Kashmir, as they are uncertain of what could happen to the Hindus in the region following a potential defeat in the current Afghan-Pakistani war, it being dubbed “a simple protective measure of our ethnic people.'' by the Indian government.     Perhaps this could bring an end to the region that has plagued with border skirmishes and conflict?"
 AFGPAKWAR.1.d:0 "After tensions boiled to an absolute high, Afghanistan today has announced it’s invasion of the Pakistan, stating that it’s invasion is to prevent further conflict in the region, with the casus belli of liberating the rightful land the Pashtuns lived on. Reports come in from Chaman, a city near the border that Afghan soldiers have steamed through with no regard for the civilian populace. Some nations in the region boycotting the invasion, with even talk of sanctions on Afghanistan. Whether any other nations get involved is left unknown. The future is uncertain for this part of the world."
 Afghanistan.6.d:0 "Today in Kabul, the Afghan Government convened a hand-picked tribal council. It included the members of the National Assembly. The Afghan parliament made a proclamation against Pakistan, and in favor of the Pashtuns' right of self-determination. In disregard to the established global norms and international laws, it passed a resolution, rejecting, unilaterally, all treaties, conventions, and agreements concluded between the Afghan government and the British India government. The council passed a resolution in support of Pashtunistan and declared the 1893 Durand Agreement, the Anglo-Afghan Pact of 1905, the Independence Treaty of Rawalpindi of 1919, the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 and other treaties and agreements in regard to international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan (based on Durand Line) and in regard to the status of the Pashtuns as null and void, having no legal implication. In addition, to reaffirm this abrogation, Pashtunistan Day was declared to be officially celebrated every year on August 31."
 AFG_SHIA.5.d:0 "With the establishment of the new Republic of Afghanistan, led by Ismael Balkhi, the monarchy has nowhere to stay. With riots across the nation from supporters of the new government have been forced to leave. The royal palace has been vandalized and the monarchy has fled the nation. As to where they went is unknown at this time, but rumors say they allegedly fled to nearby Iraq or Jordan. There is no solid evidence and the new government does not seem to care. Now the monarchy is gone, we can end discrimination against the Hazaras and Tajik and to stop the favoritism regarding the Pashtuns, to bring about true equality to Afghanistan."
