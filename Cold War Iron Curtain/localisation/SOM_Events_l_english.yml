 somnews.1.d:0 "The United Nations agreed to give Italy the responsibility of overseeing its former colony of Somaliland as a UN Trust Territory. The territory has been under British military occupation since it captured the area in 1941, during the East Africa campaign. British officials are expected to begin a withdrawal and hand over the administration to Italy. However, UN representatives were quick to say this is not a restoration of Italian colonial rule. The Italians agreed with local Somali independence activists to give independence within ten years. In addition, the Italian administration must regularly provide reports indicating its progress in preparing Somaliland for independence. The United Nations will also establish field offices and observers on the ground to monitor and provide aid in developing Somaliland. The Italian government views this as a major victory and many Italians share in the government’s view that Italy should see to guiding its former territories towards independence, not the states which occupied Italian colonies during World War II. The leading Somali independence party, the Somali Youth League released a statement saying it was hopeful for the future but prepared to hold Italy accountable if it failed to live up to its responsibilities. Although all parties involved seemed satisfied, privately, some diplomats suggest Italy may lack the economic capacity or political will to see this process through or effectively.
 som.4.d:0 "The UN’s objective of providing independence within 10 years for the people of Somaliland was finally fulfilled with the Italian Somaliland gaining independence from Italy today. The newly formed Somaliland simultaneously united with British Somaliland, which gained their own independence just a few days before. The unification immediately brought the Somali Republic into existence, with a government forming by Abdullahi Issa and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal along with other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. However, the UN’s rushed push for the 10 year independence was exposed of its downside as the republic appears to still be under heavy colonial influence both amongst the people and the government. For now, the fate of the land of Somalia relies upon the republic."
