 thetroubles.0.d:0 "At a house in the Republic of Ireland, figures gather around a map. This is the IRA army high command, and they are planning their next move."
 troublesfailedraid.d:0 "Soldiers raiding a suspected IRA safehouse in Northern Ireland seem to have gotten some bad intel. Their raid accidentally targeted a house of incidentally catholic individuals. Two civilians have been shot as a result of the raid out of fear that they were IRA men out of uniform. The public outrage has played right into the IRA's hands, and home press accuses the Army of careless slaughter."
 thetroubles.1.d:0 "While North Ireland has had its trouble since time immemorial, it has flared up especially in recent days. The annual Apprentice Boys march in Londonderry, (or Free Derry to the Republicans) has been met with petrol bombs and stones this year from the Irish Catholic community. The police response, expecting an easy dispersal, encountered days of resistance with little relief. The situation has gotten worse as more riots stretch police resources thin. The British Army is being deployed to Ireland to restore order, while the IRA pledges to battle it."

 The_Troubles_desc:0 "Ever since 1919, the Irish Republican Army in one form or another has been a menace to British operations in Ireland. It was the IRA that expelled the British from the Republic, but they consider their job incomplete without the 6 counties of Ulster. Now they work from illegal bases in the Republic, just across the border, to drive us from the island. Bomb by bomb, they will stop at nothing to drive the British from Ireland and reunite their island - sometimes at the cost of civilian life.\n Current Strength: [?IRA|R]%"

 thetroubles.2.d:0 "Having arrived in Ireland, our troops have discovered that the IRA's threat to fight back is no paper threat. Londonderry has been declared a no-go zone, and much of the countryside is thought to be full of IRA men."
 thetroubles.3.d:0 "News is coming in from Belfast of a deadly bomb attack on the corner of North Queen and Great George street. Casualties are still coming in and initial estimates are over 30, with an unknown number of dead. The perpetrators are yet unknown, but our ground forces say that an IRA bomb prematurely exploded."
 thetroubles.4.d:0 "In Belfast, a bomb has exploded on the corner of North Queen and Great George street at McGurk's Bar. 15 are dead, and 17 are injured, primarily catholics. The loyalist, protestant Ulster Volunteer Force is thought by the public to be responsible, though British authorities blame the IRA."

 troubleswinraid.desc:0 "Late last night, a section of soldiers in Northern Ireland carried out a calculated raid on an IRA safehouse. No casualties were taken and several prominent IRA men have been interned."
 thetroubles.50.d:0 "With public support for the war in Ireland reaching a nadir and the IRA humiliating our forces at every turn, even our bases in Belfast are unsafe. The IRA have contacted us and given us a simple order - evacuate our troops from Ireland and transfer Ulster to the republic or risk more bombs."
 thetroubles.52.d:0 "Today, Headquarters Northern Ireland has issued the order to withdraw all soldiers from Ulster. After a long and bloody guerilla war, the IRA has once again humiliated the British Army, despite their prior defeats in the 40's and 50's. Queen Elizabeth II has assented to a bill that officially transfers the province to the Republic of Ireland, as the island is united under Gaelic rule for the first time in 800 years. While the British Army no longer has to face bombings from the IRA, the troubles are likely not over, as the UVF swears to drive the Republic out of Ulster."

 raid_safehouses_tt:0 "Headquarters Northern Ireland will organize a raid of believed IRA safehouses. We can get a better picture of IRA safehouses by turning some IRA men into informers."
 checkpoints_tt:0 "The Army will set up checkpoints and patrols throughout Ulster. While this will slow the growth of the IRA's influence, it may also expose us to ambushes."
 thetroubles.13.d:0 "While patrolling the countryside, several men have been killed and injured by IRA snipers, with many more being wounded. The casualty reports are not being well-recieved back home. What's worse, the IRA are capitalizing on their victories, heralding them as the beginning of the end of our presence in Ireland."
 thetroubles.14.d:0 "While patrolling the countryside, our soldiers have eliminated and captured several IRA snipers. While claiming the dead as martyrs, the defeat has injured the IRA's reputation among republicans."

 thetroubles.15.d:0 "In a busy street in Ulster, a car bomb detonated today, killing 5 policemen and civilians. The IRA has claimed responsibility, and promises that these attacks will continue until Britain leaves Northern Ireland."
 thetroubles.16.d:0 "While on a routine patrol, an officer of the RUC found an undetonated bomb beneath a police car. The device was safely removed and defused, though it was found to be faulty regardless. This humiliation for the IRA has set back their reputation as a danger to our forces and bolstered the public confidence in the conflict."
 thetroubles.5.d:0 "Another illegal protest has assembled in Londonderry. After passing the corner of William and Chamberlain, members of the 1st Parachute Battalion opened fire with live bullets on the protestors. Somewhere from 10 to 13 men are dead."
 thetroubles.6.d:0 "A peaceful protest in Northern Ireland has met with tragedy. After passing the junction of William and Chamberlain streets in Londonderry, members of the 1st Parachute Battalion opened fire on the march. 13 civilians have been shot, all unarmed and many being shot in the back, only excepting young Gerry Donaghy's unthrown nail bombs.

 thetroubles.43.d:0 "The IRA has had another run of bad luck. Though starting off with some promise, their current campaign in Northern Ireland has been defeated by the RUC and British Army. IRA Command promises that they will return after a period of regrouping."
 thetroubles.40.d:0 "Corresponding through a telephone, prominent politicians have been negotiating with a man who claims to represent IRA Command. He begins the negotiations by insisting on the IRA's terms - a full british withdrawal from Ulster and a handover to the republic."

 thetroubles.18.d:0 "Near Warrenpoint, County Down, a 3-vehicle convoy has been hit by a bomb, hidden on a trailer. When the reaction force had arrived to assess the site, a second 800-pound bomb detonated. 18 men are dead, the deadliest attack in our time in Ireland. On top of all of this, Lord Mountbatten Windsor's boat has been destroyed by an IRA bomb, and Lord Mountbatten has been killed."
 thetroubles.19.d:0 "Prisoner Bobby Sands, notable for having won election to a seat for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, has died while on hunger strike at Maze Prison with several others. He is already being used as a martyr for the IRA, and to call into question our presence in Ireland."
 thetroubles.20.d:0 "Bobby Sands, recently elected Member of Parliament for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, has died in HM Prison Maze. He was on hunger strike with fellow prisoners Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, and 7 others. They undertook the hunger strike to be redesignated political prisoners and engender international sympathy for Irish Republicanism. It is expected that the other prisoners will remain on hunger strike, and the remaining nine will also starve themselves to death."
 thetroubles.21.d:0 "The cabinet is up in the Brighton Hotel, including PM Thatcher. After a successful conference day, the cabinet have dispersed to their rooms and PM Thatcher has gone to her room, presumably to sleep. At 2:54, a bomb goes off 5 stories above her bedroom."
 thetroubles.22.d:0 "While searching through the rubble of Thatcher's suite, rescuers have confirmed our worst fears: the rubble has crushed Thatcher and her husband Denis in their sleep, as well as killing Chief Deputy Whip Sir Anthony Berry"
 thetroubles.23.d:0 "Most thankfully, PM Thatcher and her husband Denis have survived the bombing. Thatcher seems to have survived because she was up, working on her speech for the next day. The IRA has announced they were behind the attack, and their next one will succeed. PM Thatcher keeps her usual stoicism in the face of this attack, encouraging even her most bitter Labour rivals."
 thetroubles.24.d:0 "The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, has been assassinated. She was sleeping in her suite with her husband Denis when a bomb went off.

 internment:0 "Internment without Trial"
 thetroubles.53.d:0 "The IRA command has ordered a halt to operations in Northern Ireland. Though splinter organizations defy the ceasefire and continue operations, their lack of resources means they are not any more dangerous than a gang. The British Government has stated that this is, quote, a great day for democracy and peace."

These guns will be left near the scene, and when they trace the guns, they will trace them back to the Official IRA, with a few helpful names provided by our helpers."
 IRA_infighting_false_flag_outcome:0 "Our risky and morally dubious gambit has paid off. The Provisional IRA has begun a shoot-on-sight campaign against the Official IRA in retaliation for the shooting we carried out. This will undoubtedly weaken their common cause."
