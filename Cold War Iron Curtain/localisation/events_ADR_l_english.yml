 ADR_sell_tech.0.d:0 "A high-level delegation recently arrived from Vienna. During talks a senior Austrian official proposed that we purchase high quality consumer goods from them. They noted the Austrian Democratic Republic had the most advanced and high quality consumer goods the socialist world and such products could greatly benefit our nation and its people. It is quite apparent the delegation expects us to give a definitive answer to their proposal. If we buy the goods, it will hurt our financial reserves certainly, but it would strengthen the bond between our two states. In addition, such high quality goods may prove beneficial for us. If we reject the Austrian proposal, the delegation will certainly express disappointment."
 ADR_sell_tech.1.d:0 "A delegation was recently dispatched to [FROM.GetName] in order to discuss shared issues facing both of us and offer to sell consumer goods to them. Selling the goods to fellow socialist states will strengthen the socialist world and raise the happiness of our citizens in competition with the West. After receiving the proposal, the government of [FROM.GetName] enthusiastically accepted. They stated their desire to advance their people and do it through the knowledge gained in the socialist world. The successful visit no doubt strengthens the ties between the Austrian Democratic Republic and [FROM.GetName] . Already plans are being made for future consumer goods sales offers to eager and friendly states."
 ADR_sell_tech.2.d:0 "A delegation was recently dispatched to [FROM.GetName] in order to discuss shared issues facing both of us and offer to sell consumer goods to them. Selling the goods to fellow socialist states will strengthen the socialist world and raise the happiness of our citizens in competition with the West. After receiving the proposal, the government of [FROM.GetName] stunned our diplomats by declining. They did not do so abruptly or rudely but noted financial constraints hindered their ability to purchase the goods. Of course this is likely lies, once the delegation returns we will temporarily downgrade the embassy staff and its consular services to show our displeasure."
