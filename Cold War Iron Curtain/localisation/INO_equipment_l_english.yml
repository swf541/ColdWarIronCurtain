In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

To address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, bird-cage flash suppressor replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced."

Despite the U.S. refusal to Lend-Lease the B-29, four B-29s crash landed in Soviet territory, and that was enough to begin the reverse-engineering process. Despite many difficulties (procuring parts that were equivalent or superior to American-developed parts, conversion from imperial to metric system, etc.) the Tu-4's first flight and entry into service was enough to panic the U.S. and Great Britain, the first of many during the Cold War. It would have a brief service life however, replaced by jet bombers by the mid-1960s. Its NATO reporting name is Bull."
