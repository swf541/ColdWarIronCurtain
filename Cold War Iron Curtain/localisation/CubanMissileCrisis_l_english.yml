 cubamc.1.t:0 "Cuba Asks for Missile Deployment"
 cubamc.1.d:0 "The Cuban government has sent their diplomat to Moscow to talk to us about deploying our missiles to Cuban soil. The Cubans feel that another American invasion is imminent and they need our missiles to stop the Americans from landing in Cuba. What shall we do?"
 cubamc.1.a:0 "Deploy the Missiles to Cuba"
 cubamc.1.b:0 "We will not risk the Americans finding out"
 cubamc.2.t:0 "Soviets accept Missile Deployment"
 cubamc.2.d:0 "The Soviets have agreed to send a army group of mechanized infantry with medium and heavy bombers with nuclear capability, along with several R-12 and R-14 IRBMs. The Soviets have called this Operation Anadyr and are sending their fleet this week."
 cubamc.2.a:0 "Good, this will make the Americans think twice."
 cubamc.3.t:0 "Soviet Missile Sites Spotted in Cuba"
 cubamc.3.d:0 "Our U-2 Spy Planes have reported Soviet ships in the area carrying large crates and planes. We have even spotted what looks to be missile silos and launch pads. There are more Soviet ships and planes heading towards Cuba. We must do something about this before the missile silos are built and Cuba having nuclear capability. Here are our options:"
 cubamc.3.a:0 "Do nothing."
 cubamc.3.b:0 "Use Diplomatic Pressure"

cubamc.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Soviet Missile Sites Discovered In Cuba"
 cubamc.4.d:0 "The United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, when a U-2 operated by the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2 was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile. US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance  on September 10, members restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. In September 1962, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island. When the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather kept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province, in western Cuba."
 cubamc.4.a:0 "Those missile sites will be removed."
 cubamc.4.b:0 "We never deployed any Sites."
 cubamc.4.c:0 "Another Crisis is on hand."
 cubamc.5.t:0 "Negotiations about Soviet Missile Deployment"
 cubamc.5.d:0 "The Americans have sent a diplomat to negotiate this new crisis. The Americans are calling for us to remove our missile sites and to cease all shipments to Cuba. We will negotiate with them and solve this."
 cubamc.5.a:0 "We will remove our missiles only if West Berlin is transferred to East Germany"
 cubamc.5.b:0 "We will remove the missiles only if American Jupiter missiles are removed from Turkey and Italy."
 cubamc.5.c:0 "We will remove the missiles."
 cubamc.6.t:0 "Americans Offering a Deal"
 cubamc.6.d:0 "The Americans have offered us a deal to remove Soviet missiles in our country. They said they will it will be  unlikely for them to invade the island, only if we remove our missile sites given to us by the Soviets. What should we do? Should we betray the Soviets?"
 cubamc.6.a:0 "We accept this deal."
 cubamc.6.b:0 "We will not accept backroom deals"
 cubamc.6.c:0 "This is a ploy! Request missile launches."
 cubamc.7.t:0 "American Blockade on Cuba"
 cubamc.7.d:0 "The American Navy has blockade all routes into Cuba unless we let them search our ships. They are looking for weapons and technology that could be use for missiles. This is considered an act of war too. Your advisors are talking about either keeping the ships on their current path, sneaking weapons and materials through our submarines, or just turn them around to avoid World War III."
 cubamc.7.a:0 "Keep the ships on the current path."
 cubamc.7.b:0 "Launch Operation Kama. Our subs sneak in."
 cubamc.7.c:0 "Turn back the convoy."
 cubamc.8.t:0 "Soviets Demand West Berlin for East Germany"
 cubamc.8.d:0 "The Soviets have demanded that we remove all NATO troops out of West Berlin and cede it to East Germany. They will then remove their missiles from Cuba and cease all shipments. Should we trust them and give up West Berlin?"
 cubamc.8.a:0 "We cede West Berlin to stop World War III."
 cubamc.8.b:0 "No we will not accept it. Blockade any further shipments to Cuba."
 cubamc.9.t:0 "Soviets Demand American Missiles to be Removed"
 cubamc.9.d:0 "The Soviets have said that if we remove our Jupiter missile sites in Turkey and Italy, they will remove their missile sites in Cuba. Is this a good deal or should we try something else?"
 cubamc.9.a:0 "We will trade missile sites."
 cubamc.9.b:0 "That won't work. Blockade the shipments to Cuba."
cubamc.10.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]NATO cedes West Berlin to East Germany"
 cubamc.10.d:0 "Today the Americans and Soviets signed the Berlin Agreements, allowing West Berlin to be annexed into East Berlin and under East German control. The Soviets in return will remove all missile silos in Cuba and stop all future shipments. People in West Berlin have been seen trying to escape and take flights to the main land. Some are calling this a victory for peace, and some are calling it a failure for NATO and a crucial victory for the Soviets."
 cubamc.10.a:0 "We did what we had to do"
 cubamc.10.b:0 "This is a great victory for Communists everywhere."
 cubamc.10.c:0 "World War III has been averted, but for how long?"
cubamc.11.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Missile Site Trade to be made"
 cubamc.11.d:0 "after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba. At 9:00 am EST, a new message from Khrushchev was broadcasted on Radio Moscow. Khrushchev stated that "the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union." At 10:00 am, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiter-class missiles in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer."
 cubamc.11.a:0 "This is a victory for Capitalism."
 cubamc.11.b:0 "This is a victory for Communism."
 cubamc.11.c:0 "This Crisis has been defused."
 cubamc.12.t:0 "Cuba Requests Soviet Missiles to be removed"
 cubamc.12.d:0 "The Cubans have said to us to remove our missile silos and cease all shipments of weapons. The Cubans have said that they will be fine without the missiles. Some of our advisors are saying something isn't right, and it seems like the Cubans made a deal with the Americans secretly. Should we trust the Cubans or the advisors and be suspicious?"
 cubamc.12.a:0 "We will trust the Cuban Government."
 cubamc.12.b:0 "Castro and the Cubans have betrayed us."
 cubamc.13.t:0 "Cubans Deny Deal"
 cubamc.13.d:0 "Castro has denied a deal with us. They said they would not betray their Soviet ally for a agreement of a "unlikely" invasion of Cuba. What should we do now?"
 cubamc.13.a:0 "Blockade the Cuban Island of any shipments."
 cubamc.13.b:0 "Launch Operation Ortsac!"
cubamc.14.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Cubans move missile sites out of Cuba"
 cubamc.14.d:0 "The Cuban Government has requested all Soviet personal and equipment to be removed from Cuba and all shipments to stop immediately. The Soviets have said that will trust the Cuban's word and remove the sites. The Americans have called this a great success and the disarmament of nuclear weapons. There are however, some critics of the Soviet's decision saying that, the Cubans made a backroom deal with the Americans and have betray their friendship with the USSR. The good news though is that the Cuban Missile Crisis is over."
 cubamc.14.a:0 "The Cubans would trust us more."
 cubamc.14.b:0 "This was a good deal."
 cubamc.14.c:0 "This crisis is finally over."
cubamc.15.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Cuban Government deposed and at a civil war"
 cubamc.15.d:0 "The Soviets have accused of Castro doing backroom deals behind the Soviet's back with the Americans. The Soviets have launched a coup against Castro. The Soviets say that they have broken their alliance and that a new government must be formed. Castro has said that he will fight the coup. A civil war has started in Cuba."
 cubamc.15.a:0 "Our only hope is Castro winning"
 cubamc.15.b:0 "Purge Castro and his betraying government!"
 cubamc.15.c:0 "A fight between the Communist Bloc. Is this the end for Communism?"

cubamc.16.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Cuban Invasion of America! World War III has begun!"
 cubamc.16.d:0 "The World has entered into World War III, when Castro launched an attack on American soil. The Cubans launched missiles from Cuba on American soil. This followed up with Cuban amphibious landings in Florida. The Americans have retaliated and launched attacks on Cuba. The Soviets have entered the war with the Cubans and the world is now engulfed in the fires of World War III."
 cubamc.16.a:0 "We will defeat the Communist aggressors!"

 cubamc.16.e:0 "We will fight the Capitalists!"
cubamc.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]OPLAN 316 Launched! World War III has begun!"
 cubamc.17.d:0 "The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba. They were Wrong, Shortly after launching OPLAN316, which envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy following Air Force and naval airstrikes it would lead the Soviets to presume "a clear line" to conquer Berlin, War was declared between the United States of America and the USSR.  The World is now in another World War."
 cubamc.17.a:0 "We had no other choice."
 cubamc.17.b:0 "This war was coming eventually."
 cubamc.17.c:0 "Will the World be safe?"
cubamc.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]American Airstrike on Soviet Missile Positions!"
 cubamc.18.d:0 "The Americans have launched their bombers and late last night bombed most Soviet missile sites. The Cuban and Soviet Governments have declared this an act of war, and have retaliated. The White House has said that there were no other options and that this was the only way to stop nuclear missiles sites from popping up more. Fighting has been reported in Cuba, but also Europe. The world is now in World War III."
 cubamc.18.a:0 "We had no other choice."

 cubamc.18.c:0 "Will the World be destroyed?"
 cubamc.19.t:0 "Soviet Convoy Still on Path"
 cubamc.19.d:0 "The Soviets have stated that there is no missiles or weapons on their convoy towards Cuba. They have said they will not listen to the blockade and continue their path towards Cuba. What should we do? If they past the blockade do we open fire?"
 cubamc.19.a:0 "Warn the Soviets one last time."
 cubamc.19.b:0 "Fire at will if they past it."
 cubamc.19.c:0 "End the blockade. We aren't risikng WWIII"

 cubamc.20.c:0 "Let them through the blockade."
cubamc.21.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]American Blockade on Cuba!"
 cubamc.21.d:0 "At 5:00 pm, President Kennedy met with Congressional leaders who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister, British Prime Minister, West German Chancellor, and French President to brief them on the US intelligence and their proposed response. All were supportive of the U.S position. at 7:00 pm EDT, Kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. "It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union. To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.""
 cubamc.21.a:0 "Pull your ships back or war!"
 cubamc.21.b:0 "They are playing with fire."
 cubamc.21.c:0 "Will World War III break out?"
 cubamc.22.t:0 "Americans Warn Soviet Convoy Last Time"
 cubamc.22.d:0 "The Americans have warned the convoy that if they pass the line, they will fire. They have warned us for the last time. Should we take our chances and see if they don't? What should we do? The Americans are on DEFCON 2. Should we prepare for war?"
 cubamc.22.a:0 "Turn back the convoy."
 cubamc.22.b:0 "Send the ships in!"
cubamc.23.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Soviet Subs on Way to Cuba!"
 cubamc.23.d:0 "Project 641 submarine B-59, as the flagship of a detachment with its sister ships B-36, B-4 and B-130, sailed from the Kola Peninsula to the Caribbean Sea, in support of Soviet arms deliveries to Cuba. However, units of the United States Navy – the aircraft carrier USS Randolph and destroyers – detected B-59 near Cuba. US vessels began dropping depth charges of the type used for naval training and containing very little charge. The purpose was to attempt to force the submarine to the surface for positive identification. Messages from the US Navy, to communicate that practice depth charges were being used, never reached B-59 or, it seems, Soviet naval HQ. The three primary officers on board – Captain Valentin Savitsky, the political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and commander of the deployed submarine detachment Vasili Arkhipov, equal in rank to Savitsky but the senior officer aboard B-59, were only authorized to launch the torpedo if they all unanimously agreed to do so. B-59 was the only sub in the flotilla that required three officers' authorization in order to fire the "Special Weapon" unlike the other subs which only required the captain and the political officer to approve the launch, but, due to Arkhipov's position as detachment commander, B-59's captain and political officer were needed to gain his approval as well. Arkhipov alone opposed the launch, and eventually he persuaded Savitsky to surface the submarine and await orders from Moscow."
 cubamc.23.a:0 "These subs will not pass."
 cubamc.23.b:0 "Those subs need to make Havana."
 cubamc.23.c:0 "Nuclear Subs off of the US?"
cubamc.24.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Soviet Convoy turns back!"
 cubamc.24.d:0 "The Soviets have come to a decision to pull back their convoy back to the Black Sea instead of fulfilling their supply mission to Cuba. The Soviets were right at the American Naval Blockade, when they got the call to return to port. The Americans said they were ready to fire, if they were going to pass the blockade. The Soviet sub convoy has also turned back with 1 sub being broken, and having to be towed back."
 cubamc.24.a:0 "The Soviets made the right decision."
 cubamc.24.b:0 "We couldn't risk World War III"
 cubamc.24.c:0 "Is the Cuban Missile Crisis coming to an end?"
 cubamc.25.t:0 "Operation Kama has been spotted!"
 cubamc.25.d:0 "The Americans have spotted our Soviet sub convoy and have warned them about the blockade. The subs are still on their current path. Should we message them about the blockade, or do we tell them to continue on? One of the ships is reporting that the Americans ships around them are throwing hand grenades at them. Some are even saying depth charges might be dropped. This could start World War III. Our advisors are mixed on the subject. What should we do about the subs?"
 cubamc.25.a:0 "Tell them to turn back."
 cubamc.25.b:0 "Tell them to continue on path."
 cubamc.25.c:0 "Tell the sub to fire when ready."
cubamc.26.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Soviet Sub fires at American Warship!"
 cubamc.26.d:0 "The Soviet sub convoy has launched missiles at the American warships surrounding them. The Soviets said that one of the sub's crews reported that the Americans were throwing over hand grenades and thought they were depth charges. The Soviets have taken this as an attack on their submarine and have fired at the warships. Several ships have been sunk and the subs escaping. This has escalated to a full blown war now. Will the subs fire their nuclear missiles though?"
 cubamc.26.a:0 "The Soviets are insane! It was a precautionary maneuver."
 cubamc.26.b:0 "The Americans will no longer play with fire."
 cubamc.26.c:0 "A simple hand grenade started the spark of World War III."
 cubamc.27.t:0 "Soviet Subs stay on Path"
 cubamc.27.d:0 "The Soviets have told their subs to continue their current path. Don't they know they could cause World War III? They are about to reach the blockade. Your advisors seem to be mixed. What should we do?"
 cubamc.27.a:0 "Fire on them!"
 cubamc.27.b:0 "Let them through."
 cubamc.27.c:0 "Pull the blockade back."
cubamc.28.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]End of the Cuban Missile Crisis"
 cubamc.28.d:0 "The Cuban Missile Crisis has finally come to an end. What was thought to be the world entering World War III, has finally ended peacefully. The Soviets and Americans have come to agreement about the missile silos in Cuba. Some are wondering when the next crisis will pop up with the Americans and Soviets."
 cubamc.28.a:0 "The Soviets are delaying the inevitable."
