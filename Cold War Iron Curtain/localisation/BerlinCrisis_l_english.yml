 berlincrisis.1.d:0 "At the Vienna summit on [GetDateText], tensions rose. Meeting with US President [USA.GetLeader], Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing four-power agreements guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin. In the growing confrontation over the status of Berlin, [USA.GetLeader] undercut his own bargaining position during his Vienna summit negotiations with Khrushchev in June 1961. [USA.GetLeader] essentially conveyed US acquiescence to the permanent division of Berlin. This made his later, more assertive public statements less credible to the Soviets. What should we do about the Berlin Question?"

 berlincrisis.2.d:0 "After talks in the Vienna Summit, the Soviet Union gave NATO a ultimatum to decide about the Berlin Question. The Soviets want West Berlin to be incorporated back in East Berlin and it to be a unified city under the German Democratic Republic. A NATO summit began a couple of weeks ago, and after talks NATO has decided to pull out of West Berlin. NATO made a statement saying that the World can not be pulled into World War III because of a divided city. The American, French, and British troops stationed in West Berlin are being pulled out and thousands of civilians are trying to get out. Many experts criticized this decision as this radically expands the USSR's sphere of influence, but at least the Berlin Crisis has come to an end."
 berlincrisis.2.a:0 "Hopefully this will prevent World War III."

 berlincrisis.3.d:0 "As the confrontation over Berlin escalated, Kennedy, in a speech delivered on nationwide television the night of 25th of July, reiterated that the United States was not looking for a fight and that he recognized the \"Soviet Union's historical concerns about their security in central and eastern Europe\". He said he was willing to renew talks, but he also announced that he would ask Congress for an additional $3.25 billion for military spending. He wanted six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marines, and announced plans to triple the draft and to call up the reserves. Kennedy proclaimed: \"We seek peace, but we shall not surrender\". The same day, Kennedy requested an increase in the Army's strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million, and the authority to bring some reserve units into active duty. Vacationing in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Khrushchev was reported to be angered by Kennedy's speech. John Jay McCloy, Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who happened to be in the Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy that Kennedy's military build-up threatened war."

 berlincrisis.5.t:0 "Berlin Crisis Gets Hotter"
 berlincrisis.5.d:0 "The Soviet Union is displeased by NATO not accepting the ultimatum, stating the the Motherland sacrificed millions of lives to get to Berlin. They said that the Western powers will cause World War III if they do not leave Berlin, and in consequence will cause the deaths of billions.

The Soviet checkpoint had direct communications to General Anatoly Gribkov at the Soviet Army High Command, who in turn was on the phone to Khrushchev. The US checkpoint contained a Military Police officer on the telephone to the HQ of the US Military Mission in Berlin, which in turn was in communication with the White House. Kennedy offered to go easy over Berlin in the future in return for the Soviets removing their tanks first. The Soviets agreed. Kennedy stated concerning the Wall \"It's not a very nice solution, but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war\". A Soviet tank moved about 5 meters backwards first; then an American tank followed suit. One by one the tanks withdrew."

 SOV_khruschev_reforms_desc:0 "Stalin's death in 1953 triggered a power struggle, from which Khrushchev emerged victorious. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the "Secret Speech", which denounced Stalin's purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces."
 SOV_the_secret_speech_desc:0 "In 1956, Khrushchev heavily criticized the deceased Comrade Stalin on his purges executed in the 1930s and criticized his great faults in creating a cult of personality instead of fostering communism for the Soviet worker. This speech heavily influenced the Sino-Soviet split and the weakening of the Soviet political sphere everywhere on the planet."
 SOV_sino_soviet_split_desc:0 "After the publishing of the secret speech by Khrushchev in 1956, Mao denounced Khrushchev as a revisionist for his criticizing views on Stalinism, which formed the basis for many communist systems all over the globe, and the split heavily weakened the USSR, as it was losing one of it's most important allies and economical partners in the planet."
 SOV_peaceful_coexistence_desc:0 "In the 20th Party Congress, Khrushchev defended and solidified the concept of coexistence with the USA after great rising tensions of nuclear warfare. The proclamation meant the end of the Soviet advocacy of the spread of communism through violence, which communists over the world saw as a betrayal to the principles of a communist revolution."
