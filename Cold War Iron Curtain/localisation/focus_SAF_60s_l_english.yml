 saf_news.1.d:0 "The South African Police Force has come under scrutiny from a great number of governments after news broke of police officers firing on a crowd of protestors. The crowd had been protesting the Pass Laws of South Africa's white minority government when police became alarmed and proceeded to shoot into the protesting crowds. Reinforcements, jets and tear gas were used in attempts to scatter the crowd but this only led to the protestors becoming more violent. Rocks were thrown and some minor fights took place before the Sharpeville Massacre, as it has been dubbed, occurred. The result of which was 249 casualties - 29 being children. World leaders and international organizations have already moved to condemn the National Party of South Africa and it's continued use of apartheid."
 saf_news.200.d:0 "Hendrik Verwoed, the South African president widely considered to be the founder of apartheid, has died today. At 2:15 local time, an unknown parliamentary aide stabbed the president four times. The president was rushed to the hospital and announced dead. The president had previously survived an assassination attempt, but this time, despite the aid of some medically trained Parliament members, he has not been so lucky.\n Verwoed during his time in office created a South African Republic, emphasizing Anglophobia and isolationism in order to give credence to his regime. His actions led to the removal of South African team from many sporting events. In his first term, he also faced the critique of the United Nations and their sanctions. During his reign, the South African military-industrial complex was created. In addition, he may have created a South African nuclear and biological weapons program, but this is of yet unconfirmed. \n However, many doubt that this will be the end of Apartheid."
