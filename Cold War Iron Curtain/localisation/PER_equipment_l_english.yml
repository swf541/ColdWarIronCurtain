It is one of the few air forces in the Middle East, with experience in a conventional war, having fought the Iran-Iraq War. It has carried out major operations like Operation Kaman 99, Operation Sultan 10, the H-3 airstrike, and the first attack on a nuclear reactor in history, in Operation Scorch Sword. As a result of fighting a brutal and intense non-stop air war during 8 years, the IRIAF has the highest number of fighter aces in the region (besides the IAF), having as many as 7 people with more than 6 kills. Most of these aces achieved their status flying the F-14 Tomcat jet. Evolving from its experiences in that conflict, the IRIAF has developed real battle tested tactics and a cadre of skillful pilots.

 PER_jet_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "The F-84 was designed as a day-time fighter-bomber aircraft set to replace the earlier P-47 Thunderbolt. Despite entering service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by many problems. So much so, that until the introduction of the 'D' Variant in 1949, the F-84 was very nearly cancelled. The type served as the primary strike aircraft for the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, and was the first fighter aircraft used by the USAF's demonstration team, the 'Thunderbirds.' It is perhaps for that reason why 'Thunderjet' would be a fitting name for the type."

Despite improved capabilities compared to its straight winged predecessor, it still had the same flaws in takeoff performance while having poor stability and control. The type would serve in a limited capacity throughout its life, serving until 1971. Its nickname is 'Thunderstreak.'"
