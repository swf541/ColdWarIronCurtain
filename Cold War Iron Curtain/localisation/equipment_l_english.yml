 sam_carrier_equipment_desc:0 "Surface-to-air missiles are homing missiles used to target mid-air or high-air targets, although the SAM carriers that you build and deploy with divisions are mid-air or close-air SAM carriers only. Air targets are fast moving, hard to hit, and have immense distance from ground troops. It is for this reason that seeking, self-correcting missiles are needed to engage these targets."

 medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_desc:0 "Tank destroyers are armored combat vehicles armed with a direct fire gun that has been specialized in anti-armor capability. They exist, as the name implies, to erradicate armored combat vehicles.\n\nMobile Gun Systems are direct fire guns too heavy to be an ARV equipped onto a chassis too light to be a MBT. Mobile Gun Systems usually serve a direct combat role, although rarely engage tanks directly."
 
 atgm_equipment:0 "Anti-Tank Guided Missile"
 atgm_equipment_short:0 "ATGM"
 atgm_equipment_desc:0 "Anti-tank guided missiles are guided missiles used to destroy tanks. ATGMs have very long range and accuracy but are vulnerable to defeat by countermeasures. A notable advantage of ATGMs is their relative low cost to the vehicles they are intended to destroy. However, most up to date or retrofitted tanks come equipped with active countermeasures or passive protection and as such, outdated ATGMs are usually only good for defeating improperly outfitted tanks or vehicles that don't have ATGM protection."
 atgm_carrier_equipment:0 "Anti-Tank Guided Missile Carrier"
 atgm_carrier_equipment_short:0 "ATGM Carrier"
 atgm_carrier_equipment_desc:0 "ATGM Carriers are vehicles outfitted with anti-tank guided missiles. They are typically light and fast vehicles that target and engage vehicles outside of normal range using devastating homing missiles. Although armored combat vehicles can also come with ATGMs, ATGM carriers are usually cheaper and it is inexpensive to outfit outdated infantry transports or utility vehicles to become ATGM carriers and perpetuate the vehicle's usability to its physical lifepsan."

Heavy tanks are slow and expensive but carry large cannons and have very strong armor making them perfect for dealing with heavily fortified locations. Heavy tanks would eventually be phased out as main battle tanks would wind up incorporating the firepower of heavy tanks in a smaller, more optimized package. Additionally, main battle tanks can be upgunned to carry less shots but with heavier firepower so there is no need to make heavy tanks any more."

They were rarely used as their direct fire gun required direct line of sight and heavy artillery or bombs served the same purpose but did so more efficiently.\n\nThe Nuclear Tank is a fever dream of a weapon in which nuclear engines are placed into super heavy tanks allowing for incredible speed with unlimited autonomy. Nuclear tanks were never seriously considered outside of closed experimentation by the Soviet Union and United States and never saw combat."

Cruise missiles can strike strategic or battle targets and deliver heavy payloads.\nI will now explain how they find their targets.\n\nThe missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error﻿"
