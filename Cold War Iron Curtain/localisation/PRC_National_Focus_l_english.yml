The Chinese writing system has always been regarded as one of the most difficult systems to learn, but that poses a serious obstacle in the internationalisation of the Maoist ideology. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, we have created a simplified version of every character in the language to both increase literacy and help foreigners learn our great language."

As such, we will be resuming diplomatic discourse with them. Perhaps befriending them will increase the popularity of Communism within our old enemy."
