 PRC_Focus_1_desc:0 "After the Communist victory in the civil war, the Nationalists escaped to Taiwan and steadfastly held it against further Maoist offensives, along with the island of Taiwan, a few islands in the South China Sea were also captured by the Nationalists, such as Kinmen and Matsu, deploying 58,000 troops on Kinmen and 15,000 troops on Matsu. Recently, troops from the People's Liberation Army have begun shelling the aforementioned islands; with Zhou Enlai claiming that Taiwan must be liberated from the oppressive forces of the Kuomintang that currently rule with an iron fist. The PLA also sent forces to seize the Yijiangshan Islands, located off the coast of Zhejiang."
 PRC_Focus_2_desc:0 "Following the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao Zedong was determined to root out \"reactionary\" elements from the nation, establishing a campaign to prosecute those that criticized the government of the PRC. Immediately after the end of the Hundred Flowers movement, Mao began to arrest intellectuals and critics; with the penalties of hard labor or execution in some cases, with the judicial power being replaced by political cadres and the police. It was soon seen that 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists - it was rumored that Deng Xiaoping was one of the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during its wave of purges. The resentment against \"rightists\" goes as far back in the Communist Party as the Long March, exemplified as the hatred against Zhang Bojun."
 PRC_Focus_3_desc:0 "\nWith the advent of the Hundred Flowers movement, which brought dozens of letters and outspoken protests in Maoist China, it did not take long for the ethnic and religious minorities all over China to follow the examples of the intellectuals to criticize their treatment in China by the authorities; along with criticisms to the CPC and Mao Zedong himself. The Helmsman soon answered with the purge of the intellectuals and along with them, the minorities. Being subject to torture, public humiliation and pressure, many of these cases were followed by suicide or executions, suffering a similar fate to the intellectuals that were crushed during the Anti-Rightist Campaign."
 PRC_Focus_4_desc:0 "Chairman Mao stated that \"the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science\". And it was with this idea that the PRC began the 'Hundred Flowers Campaign', being directed at encouraging the citizens of China to express openly their opinions, as the idea was to promote the intellectuals to discuss the country's problems in order to promote new forms or arts and cultural institutions. It didn't take long for protests to rise up against the CPC and for letters to flood Mao with criticism; just as it didn't take long for Chairman Mao to being a prosecution campaign against those that were critical of the regime and its ideology and those that were targeted were publicly criticized and condemned to prison labor camps, China soon witnessed the creation of the Anti-Rightist Movement."
 PRC_Focus_5_desc:0 "In Manchuria, Mao has launched a campaign to get rid of corrupt or otherwise pro-Taiwan elements inside China, with a focus on former KMT members, bureaucratic officials who were not official party members and party members that were corrupt. The antis were the anti-corruption, anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy. The Three-Anti campaign dished out extremely harsh punishments, including torture and all found guilty of their confessed or unconfessed crimes had to pay fines to the government. The Helmsman of the nation has claimed time and time again that this is a major measure that is necessary to rid China of corrupt members and those that embezzle and stagnate the Chinese economy with \"their own selfish gains\"."
 PRC_Focus_6_desc:0 "With the Korean War, opportunities were given to many in Northern China, which gave the rise of a new class of capitalists in Manchuria, who soon started to realize that they were not seen with friendly eyes in Beijing. The Five-Anti Campaign was soon launched, described as an all-out war against the bourgeoisie in China, and the aforementioned antis were: Anti-bribery, anti-theft of state property, anti-tax evasion, anti-cheating on government contracts and anti-stealing state economic intelligence. Some companies started to send 1,000 confessions per day in order to rid themselves of the immense pressure that the CPC put in them; parades of anti-capitalists activists went door-to-door to visit business leaders, generating immense psychological pressure. Mao said that \"we must probably execute 10,000 to several tens of thousands of embezzlers nationwide before we can solve the problem\". There were hundreds of thousands of suicides that were a direct result of this campaign; with Chinese capitalists receiving no better treatment than foreigners."
 PRC_Focus_7_desc:0 "\nAs the Anti-Rightist Campaign goes underway, many intellectuals are being arrested, tortured or otherwise humiliated and jailed. Chen Fengxiao was jailed for 15 years during the Campaign for being a Rightist and thus, betraying the Maoist movement. Many dissidents were scorched by fire, beaten to death or executed by firing squad, and an estimated 400,000 to 700,000 people were politically prosecuted; the backbreaking labor in the prison system often led to their deaths and others were completely excluded from society, such as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun, while others such as Chen Mengjia committed suicide due to the exclusion and political pressure."
 PRC_Focus_8_desc:0 "\nDuring the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in order to facilitate the prosecution of intellectuals and other dissenters of the Maoist government, legal scholars and workers were also prosecuted and sentenced to harsh jail sentences for collaborating or otherwise slowing down the Movement; the judicial system was scrutinized and watched carefully as it was slowly replaced by the Party cadres loyal to the CPC and Mao, and the police in order to facilitate the arrests and the dishing out of sentences. Those that weren't arrested were transferred to other jobs that didn't impede the takeover of the independent judiciary by the party, a move that, for many, signified that Mao was consolidating his power even further in China."
 PRC_Focus_9_desc:0 "Today it has been declared that the son of Mao Zedong, the Paramount Leader of China, has been killed-in-action by an airstrike; an experienced officer, the child of Mao fought in World War Two as an artillery officer against the Third Reich in Poland, being a volunteer of the Soviet Army. During the time of his death he was serving in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as a secretary and Russian translator for PVA commander Peng Dehuai. He was stationed at a PVA headquarters, in caves near an old gold mining settlement; it appears that four American planes dropped napalm bombs in the area, one of which destroyed a makeshift building near the caves, killing Mao Anying and another officer. Chairman Mao is reportedly deeply grieving this loss but no comment from The Helmsman was given at any time."
 PRC_Focus_10_desc:0 "The Great Helmsman of the People's Republic of China, revolutionary leader and political theorist Mao Zedong has died; suffering two heart attacks earlier in the year, a final heart attack finally struck the paramount leader down a few days later, just past midnight. The CPC has broadcasted a major radio message that announced the news of Mao's passing, while clamoring for party unity. The leader has been embalmed and draped in a CPC flag, where it will be staying at the Great Hall of the People for one week. It is estimated that one million people will come to see the Helmsman one last time, while those that already are present for it, are openly crying or displaying some degree of sadness. Chairman Mao's official portrait has been hung on the wall, with a banner reading \"Carry on the cause left by Chairman Mao and carry on the cause of proletarian revolution to the end\"."
 PRC_Focus_11_desc:0 "The Chinese government has sent troops to Chamdo in what they call a \"Liberation of Tibet\" after failed negotiations to incorporate Tibet into the nation; the People's Liberation Army has marched over the Jinsha River with hundreds of troops which have seized the border town of Qamdo and active hostilities began in the border area northeast of the Gyamo Ngul Chu River and east of the 96th meridian. It is unclear whether the People's Republic of China will immediately push forward their desire to annex Tibet but it does seem very likely, with Mao Zedong claiming that \"the Tibetan people have suffered enough, it is finally time for them to join the People's Republic of China and be liberated.\""
 PRC_Focus_12_desc:0 "\nAfter the fall of the army of the Ma Clique during the Chinese Civil War, an insurgency was established being led by former generals and veterans of Ma Bufang. The foundation of the insurgency was the fall of Ma Bufang during the Ningxia Campaign; and soon after, many generals, most of them Muslim, defected to the People's Republic of China as the collapse of the Nationalist China was imminent. Most of the former Kuomintang Muslim Generals, such as Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, Ma Dunjing, Bai Chongxi and etcetera all fled to Taiwan along with the Government of the Republic of China but Ma Bufang's subordinate officers remained behind in the province of Qinghai. Today, the last of the insurgents were crushed in Yiwu, where over 700 insurgents perished in battle as the flag of the PRC flew over the town of Yiwu."
 PRC_Focus_13_desc:0 "The PLA has announced today that it has ended the Tibetan Insurgency. As Lhasa openly rebelled against the People's Republic of China, the army shelled Norbulingka in order to disperse the crowd, placing troops in barricades that divided the city into a northern and southern part. Early in the morning the Tibetan rebels suffered a defeat against the troops of the People's Liberation Army, who fought a bloody battle in the streets before marching towards Jokhang, fighting a three hours-long battle, moments later the flag of China had been raised on the temple, which crushed the uprising. There are multiple rumors that Pandatsang Rapga, a pro-KMT and pro-ROC revolutionary leader was instrumental in the revolt against the PRC; and the Dalai Lama is nowhere to be found."
 PRC_Focus_14_desc:0 "Chairman Mao has declared that, along with the measures being taken to ensure that the Great Leap Forward takes place, a new Campaign is being approved to be executed immediately called the \"Four Pests Campaign\". The Chairman claims that this is a hygiene campaign against rats, flies, mosquitoes and sparrows; the mosquito being responsible for malaria; the rodents that spread the plague; the flies which are considered pervasive and the sparrows, which are eating the grains and seeds of the bountiful harvests in China. Contests are also being held among enterprises, government agencies and schools in cleanliness, it is reported that non-material rewards are being given to those that are handing in the most amount of rat tails, dead flies and mosquitos or dead sparrows."
 PRC_Focus_25_desc:0 "\nIn a first time détente with the Nationalists since the truce in 1946, Chairman of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, has announced that he will offer a new proposal for Taiwan which entails a general election in Mainland China and Taiwan, along with the islands that compromise the entirety of both nations. This general election, Mao says, \"has the purpose to unify both of our nations and decide the fate of China, letting the people choose between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China\". It remains to be seen whether Taiwan will accept this offer but many experts say that this is merely a ploy by Mao; attempting to show affableness and the legitimacy of his regime."    
 PRC_Focus_16_desc:0 "The Communist Party of China has declared today that, for the first time since they have taken power during the Chinese civil war, that the National People's Congress, PRC's highest organ of state power and the national legislature, will be liberalized and there will be a more active participation of the minor parties that are current part of the national legislature; one of the strongest supporters of this move was the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT, the China Democratic League and the China Democratic National Construction Association were also two parties that were strong supporters of this move and have hailed this as the next step in freeing China from becoming an oppressive regime."
 PRC_Focus_17_desc:0 "Chairman Mao has declared today that there will be a revision of the current regime of the People's Republic of China, the Chairman himself has praised the intellectuals that have criticized the government during the 'Hundred Flowers' campaign and has argued that \"the time is now for the flowers to bloom and for China to recognize the pleas of its inhabitants\". This seems to be a clear indicator by experts that the Chinese regime is planning on reforming its authoritarianism and letting itself become more moderate, it remains to be seen whether Chairman Mao will liberalize or if he will maintain his iron grip on the government."
 PRC_Focus_18_desc:0 "An uprising has begun today in Lhasa as protestors claim that Tibet is an independent nation. When fears that the CPC was going to kidnap the Dalai Lama reached the ears of its inhabitants, the people soon gathered outside the palace in order to prevent him from leaving, or worse, from being removed forcibly by the CPC and being met with an unknown fate. Soon after, barricades had been put in the streets of Lhasa and a petition for the support of the armed rebels soon appeared; both Chinese and Tibetan troops have already begun moving towards Lhasa and there have been reports of the establishment of artillery in range of the Dalai Lama's summer palace, the Norbulingka."
 PRC_Focus_19_desc:0 "Both Kang Sheng and Ren Bishi, one of the key members of the intelligence apparatus of China and the Fifth Red Army commander, respectively, affirmed that a violent campaign against the landlords in China was inevitable; as \"thirty million landlords and rich peasants would have to be destroyed\". Today, the Helmsman has declared that every peasant must take the fight to their landlords and kill them with their bare hands. Mao has expressed a desire to not \"correct excesses prematurely\" and has adopted a live-and-let-live policy to the violence that is currently occurring throughout all of China, the CPC has not endorsed nor sanctioned the physical violence of the peasants against the landlords, who are being hanged, buried alive, dismembered and shot. In the streets, they mutter \"Dou Di Zhu\" or \"Fight the Landlord\"; it appears that Chairman Mao is building support for the party with all the means necessary."
 PRC_Focus_20_desc:0 "First commander and commissar of the People's Volunteer Army, Peng Dehuai, has announced today that its forces shall be entering the DPRK in order to support it; the regime that is led by Kim Il-Sung is affable towards the PRC and towards Chairman Mao in particular; the Chinese leader has vowed to defend the DPRK and to support it whenever necessary. It seems that this army composes thousands of soldiers that are determined to help their Korean brothers in arms against the forces supported by the US; at the moment there is an assortment of insecurities regarding the future of the Korean peninsula, but Chairman Mao seems confident that the end of the war is near, and a red flag will fly over the peninsula."
 PRC_Focus_21_desc:0 "\nThe People's Republic of China is furthering its diplomatic recognitions as of recently. The Chairman of the PRC has started to ask for nations to recognize its legitimacy over its nationalist counterpart, the Republic of China. As soon as it emerged from the civil war, the People's Republic of China was immediately recognized by the USSR and the states that compromise its sphere of influence, such as the Socialist Republic of Romania, the Polish People's Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic. China is asking for recognition from Asian states such as India and North Vietnam; many experts claim that is a question of time until the PRC is recognized worldwide while others claim that the idea of the PRC being an internationally-recognized state is a pipedream, the fate is still uncertain."
 PRC_Focus_22_desc:0 "\nFollowing the attempts of the PRC to have diplomatic recognition from its Asian neighbors, the Communist nation is now branching out into other spheres, in this case, Europe. Switzerland is presenting itself as being quite interested in recognizing China and other Scandinavian nations such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland are all very positive prospects for this new attempt at recognition by the PRC; it is still a matter of geopolitical maneuvering - but Chairman Mao has expressed that he is quite positive when it comes to having his nation recognized by the West and experts are assuming that it is likely that it will be recognized in the near future."
 PRC_Focus_23_desc:0 "The Chairman of the PRC has announced today that the various cults that are present in rural China are to be hunted down due to being collaborative with the KMT, reactionary and bourgeois elements in China. The Red Spear Society has already begun to fall, with its members being arrested promptly by the forces of the CPC and the Big Swords Society seems to have met the same fate, along with the Yellow Sand Society. All of these societies have been inspired in its activities by millenarian, spiritual and romanticized monarchist ideas; most if not all of these societies vehemently opposed the Qing and believed that a Ming restoration would bring happiness and peace to all of China, it seems that Chairman Mao disagrees profusely with that idea."
 PRC_Focus_24_desc:0 "Mao Zedong has formally announced that China will take a course of action that derives itself from the need to move past the agrarian society it has been for centuries and to start taking the shape of a modern, industrial nation. It is with this intent that the Chairman of the CCP has moved forward with the Great Leap Forward. Using collectivization in people's communes, encouraging all peasants that reside in the People's Republic to produce backyard furnaces in order to supply the state with steel, banning private holdings and using irrigation projects without the use of formally educated engineers, the leader of China has promised with all of his heart that this campaign will move China into a new direction, making it one of the greatest powers in the world, if not the greatest."
 PRC_Focus_15_desc:0 "Jubilant and strong handshakes are being made today as the Premier of the PRC and the Prime Minister of the DPRK shake hands, with smile on their faces, as the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty is signed. Promising peaceful cooperation between both nations in the areas of culture, economics, technology and other social benefits, it is a clear step that the DPRK is aligning with China; furthermore, in the second article of the treaty, it is stated that the two nations will undertake all necessary measures to oppose any country or coalition of countries that might attack either nation, a measure that many are guessing to be a means for the DPRK to secure their place with a great power without suffering an invasion from its capitalist counterpart of the United States."
 PRC_Focus_26_desc:0 "Most of the Asian and African states met today in a massive reunion to discuss Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation, opposing colonialism or neocolonialism by any nation in any shape; being composed by twenty-nine countries, it represents a total population of 1.5 billion people, or 54% of the world's population. A ten-point declaration is being discussed and it seems likely that it will pass unanimously, from these points, the most important ones are the abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country, refraining from acts of threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. A final communiqué is also being presented, which is currently underscoring the need for developing countries to loosen their economic dependence on the leading industrial nations by providing technical assistance to one another through the exchange of experts and technical assistance."
 PRC_Focus_27_desc:0 "\nIn just one fell swoop, the founder of Juche and the supposed liberator of the North Koreans, Kim Il-Sung, was deposed in a palace coup. The officers, endorsers of the Chinese model of Socialism after seeing Mao's triumph against the Nationalist forces during the civil war, have proclaimed that the new Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue the fight against capitalism side by side with their new ally, the PRC. Chairman Mao has been delighted to hear the news and has declared that he sees a very bright future for all of the people that reside in North Korea. In a few moments, Chinese troops have been seen marching in Pyongyang and other cities of the Communist counterpart of the ROK. It seems a Maoist light shines upon the DPRK."
 PRC_Focus_28_desc:0 "The Politburo has united itself in the hopes of making a conference that discusses the Great Leap Forward and the benefits - and terrible mismanagement - that it brought. Peng Dehuai sent a letter to Mao during the conference, respectfully criticizing elements that made the Great Leap Forward a disastrous effort; a move that cost his career. Moments after, Mao extended the conference for ten days, where he vehemently criticized Peng Dehuai for being \"only thirty kilometers away from rightists\" and ordering his dismissal, arrest and replacement by a loyal general, Lin Biao. Soon after, Mao Zedong made a long, passionate and bellicose speech in Lushun, defending himself by claiming that he, just as the great writers such as Confucius, Lenin and Marx, has made mistakes and that focusing on those mistakes would not help the situation; he soon followed by defending his strategies in the Great Leap Forward. The Chairman has further solidified his rule inside China and it seems few, if any, dare to oppose him."
