 Brezhnev_Pol.10.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, despite his claims of doing the opposite, ruled as a dictator and sidelined party leaders. Leonid Brezhnev and the Politburo denounced these practices as backward and against the spirit of Marxist-Leninism. Brezhnev went as far as to cite Lenin as someone who always praised collective leadership. It would be natural to return to such practices. At a recent Politburo meeting, the restoration of collective leadership was announced as a means to prevent the concentration of power into one person. The government is publicly praising the decision as restoration of Marxist-Leninist practice. Senior party members will soon receive important responsibilities and Brezhnev will govern through consultation and consensus."
 Brezhnev_Pol.2.d:0 "Following the removal of Khrushchev the new Soviet leadership continued policies meant to distance themselves from him and his powerbase. This has seen the return of the old guard within the Communist Party. Under Khrushchev these men had long been sidelined or placed in low positions to keep them away from positions of power. However, with Brezhnev in control and needing his own base of support, these men are returning to the Politburo and other senior posts. The Soviet media is praising this shift and highlighting the historical role many of these men played in the early Soviet state and during World War II."
 Brezhnev_Pol.3.d:0 "Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev recently launched an effort to streamline leadership and strengthen decision making by re-structuring the party hierarchy in a more vertical structure. Previously, senior party members would just report directly to the leader, meetings were scheduled due to personal relationships and not urgency. Often the leadership was dealing with trivial matters and neglecting major or pressing matters. Brezhnev argues this prevented the government from handling major issues effectively. Having a vertical structure will allow information to be more effectively channeled and prevent the senior leadership from being bogged down with minor problems. Those minor issues will be dealt with as it goes up the chain. Many in the party praise this more scientific approach to efficient governance."
 Destalinization.49.d:0 "The Soviet government has launched a significant media campaign to blame former Premier Nikita Khrushchev for the systemic, economic, and social issues facing the Soviet Union. Khrushchev is being accused of devolving centralized authority, contrary to communist doctrine to support his personal power. Khrushchev is also being accused of overly liberalizing society, leading to disorder and a breakdown in party discipline. All these problems combined to create a weak Soviet state and economy. The new regime of Leonid Brezhnev is emphasizing these mistakes as why the Soviet people are not developing as promised. It is hoped that blaming Khrushchev will buy the new regime time to build its own credibility."
 Destalinization.50.d:0 "When Nikita Khrushchev was in power, Leonid Brezhnev largely backed his policy of destalinization. He supported the rehabilitation of Great Purge victims, criticism of arbitrary governance, and a tolerance to criticism from intellectual classes. However, after coming to power, Brezhnev has begun a reversal of these policies. The government has warned against public criticism, with several authors already being threatened with arrest. The rehabilitation of Stalin purge victims has also slowed down, likely to halt. More significantly, Brezhnev has empowered state agencies to use repressive powers to control the public and detain dissidents. However, what is clear is that this reversal of policies does not mark a return to the extreme violence and mass arrests seen under Stalin."
 Maoism_SU.1.d:0 "The Soviet leadership under Leonid Brezhnev reinstituted censorship laws to reverse the liberalization policies of former Premier Nikita Khrushchev. These new laws have angered many Soviet writers who feel hampered by the government. However, literature which Khrushchev had himself suppressed, such as Maoist literature, is now being permitted again. Maoist critiques of Khrushchev are now being permitted by the Soviet government to support its efforts to ideologically shift the party back to what it sees are proper Marxist-Leninist practices. The Soviet government will continue to strictly enforce censorship against dangerous thoughts, but also support constructive writings."
 Sakharov.1.d:0 "Former nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov has turned into a vocal critic of the government and nuclear proliferation. He rose to prominence as a dissident by breaking norms by openly opposing a scientist involved in the Stalinist purges from being voted into the Soviet Academy of the Sciences. He later married a fellow dissident and advocates for human rights. His work is a major threat to social harmony within the Soviet Union and hurts our national image. To deal with Sakharov the security agencies are investigating his personal life while the media is being directed to actively criticize and denounce Sakharov regularly. The Soviet government is also encouraging members of the Academy of Science to also join in this mass criticism campaign to discredit Sakharov."
 Sakharov_HRC.1.d:0 "Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet intellectuals formed the Committee of Human Rights in the USSR as the first independent body of human rights operating within the Soviet Union. The committee regularly publishes reports on human rights and appeals for Soviet dissidents facing charges. Soviet security agencies are closely monitoring the group but recently it was decided the Soviet government would hold talks with Sakharov. The Soviet government used the talks to claim it takes human rights seriously and will consider the concerns of the group. Many believe these talks are a public relations campaign to showcase the Brezhnev government was not going to engage in the type of repression seen in the early Soviet state. However, it is clear from the talks the government maintains it will not likely compromise on its efforts to maintain social control over party members and the people."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.1.d:0 "The various Soviet Republics have continuously implemented laws and policies designed for their own ethnic groups. A universal Soviet system across all the republics greatly eroded under Nikita Khrushchev who promoted particularism and allowed the republics to govern themselves as long as they were loyal to the Soviet Union. For Leonid Brezhnev and senior party members, this represents a major problem. If these republics continue to operate largely independent, it is only a matter of time before they begin to embrace ethnic nationalism, and this represents a major threat to Soviet unity. The government is planning reforms that can reverse the cancer of particularism and strengthen the unity of the Soviet Union."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.3.d:0 "Some of the Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union have allowed backwards people to maintain their traditional forms of governance, often tribal governments. Allowing these unique forms of governance is a common feature of particularism and the main hinderance to establishing a singular, unified Soviet system of governance. To combat this, the central Soviet leadership in Moscow has directed the relevant Socialist Republics to begin the process of abolishing these tribal governments. It is not in the interest of the people governed by these archaic and backwards practices and removing them will accelerate the development of a socialist consciousness among those people."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.2.d:0 "Lioned Brezhnev and senior party leaders identified particularism among the Soviet Socialist Republics as the principle threat to the future prosperity, socialist development, and unity of the Soviet state. To combat this dangerous threat, the Soviet government announced it will begin appointing Russians to take over leadership across the various Socialist Republics. The government claims this is not an attempt to promote Russians over any other national group but reflects that Russia is the most developed socialist state in the union. It is only natural then that Russians are the ideal leaders to help the other republics develop their own socialism, which has been hindered for years by the particularism promoted by their local nationalities."
 11th_5ypfood.0.d:0 "The senior Soviet leadership has two candidates Nikolai Tikhonov and Mikhail Gorbachev are being considered for the responsibility of developing agriculture policy. Agriculture production has been disappointing in recent years and this must be addressed. Nikolai Tikhonov is a key member of the party old guard and throughout his career he served ably as an administrator, mostly in industry and metallurgy. His proposed agricultural policy will likely seek to adjust or reform current methods and policy. Tikhonov understands agriculture has underperformed but extreme changes risks disrupting production further. Mikhail Gorbachev offers a younger perspective and he rose through the party during the post-World War II era. He believes agriculture production in the USSR is in crisis and systematic reforms will be necessary to bring production up. He argues without drastic reforms, the situation will only deteriorate further. The Party must decide whether to go with the reliable Tikhonov or trust the young and eager reformer Gorbachev."

 ABMT.1.d:0 "Premier Leonid Brezhnev and senior party officials have proposed to us an Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty. The proposed treaty would limit the deployment of such weapons only to ICBM sites and the capital. Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) systems are being developed by both of our nations to reduce the devastation of an all-out nuclear exchange. However, it is clear such projects are very expensive and risk starting a new arms race. Although we believe our advances in technology will give us an eventual advantage, some of our theorists suggest such a scenario may provoke the Soviets to strike first. The proposal appears sound as our military experts say ABM currently is not feasible of preventing nuclear annihilation. Accepting the proposal would also help relations with the Soviets. However, some senior advisors believe the Soviet proposal suggests their weakness in ABM research so we should reject the proposal and continue our own."
 SALT_II.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is proposing a new series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for both nations. This new treaty would actually call for the reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a specific cap. The treaty will also limit the development of new treaties, although current development programs in both countries will be exempted, this means future programs will be limited. The proposed treaty does not limit stockpiles dramatically and both nations will still have strategic parity, but it would halt the nuclear arms race and the stockpiling of such weapons. Considering the treaty does not dramatically change the balance of power, signing it makes sense, allow us to fund more pressing programs, and would be a great moment to garner international support. Despite this, some senior Pentagon officials are urging us not to sign the treaty and instead focus on developing more advanced systems push the strategic balance in our favor."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.1.d:0 "For years the Romanian communist party under Nicolae Ceausescu had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist line in terms of economic development, personal rights, and foreign affairs. Romania at times broke from the Soviet line on international issues and has slowly been withdrawing Romania from the Warsaw Pact military command, distressing Soviet officials. For the Soviet regime of Leonid Brezhnev this is unacceptable and a violation of his Brezhnev Doctrine. During a recent Warsaw Pact meeting, the Soviet government offered the Romanians a normalization of ties if they agree to purge their party of deviators and bring the country back on the path of Marxist-Leninism. The Soviet government noted Romanian socialism was under threat from internal forces and if did not correct itself, Moscow would not hesitate to help the people. The Romanian government must now decide how it will react to this challenge."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union was pleased to hear the recent news that during an extraordinary meeting of the Romanian Communist Party, it had decided to remove Nicolae Ceausescu and return Romania to emulate the Soviet model. Ceausescu and his allies vehemently resisted but they were outmaneuvered at the meeting. Pro-Moscow party members allied Ceausescu opponents, and others who feared a Soviet intervention to remove the long-term Romanian leader. Ceausescu was accused of deviating from Marxist-Leninism, counter-revolutionary activities, and corruption. He and his allies have been stripped of senior party posts and it remains to be seen if they will eventually face trial. The developments are a major victory for the Soviet Union and the Brezhnev Doctrine."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev has embraced a new doctrine in which Moscow reserves the right to save socialist states facing existential internal or external threats. Recently the Soviets asked the Romanian Communist Party to restore a proper, socialist character to its government and policies or suffer the consequences. Despite some efforts by dissidents within the Romanian Communist Party, the long-time ruler of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu survived and is now more firmly entrenched as leader. Once he secured himself he blamed the Soviets for interfering in Romanian affairs and refused Soviet demands. The Romanian government noted it remained committed to its revolution and socialist character and rejected Soviet claims to the contrary, suggesting the Soviet Union curtail its own ambitions."
 SOV_PLO.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has long supported the struggles of the Arabs against imperialists and their regional puppets. In particular, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) has long committed itself to the cause of national liberation of its lands seized by Israel. In order to raise awareness to their cause and pressure the Israelis, the PLO has launched several spectacular operations, which the Israelis and their allies condemn as terroristic. However, the Soviet government has decided to instead call these actions the expressions of a suppressed people and pressure the Israelis to halt their occupation. Supporting the PLO will greatly aid our image across the Arab World and help us appear as a viable, non-imperialist ally to those Arab states and organizations like the PLO."

 SOV_AFG.1.d:0 "Following the overthrow of the Afghan monarchy, the situation in Afghanistan remained uncertain. Despite Soviet backing, the government of President Daoud failed to initiate reforms and outside powers were organizing militant groups and subversions against the government. During the Saur Revolution President Daoud and his family was executed, leading to a more radical socialist government. However, despite massive Soviet support, the new regime has struggled. A recent outbreak of rebellions, especially around Herat, has led elements within the government to ask for Soviet aid. From the border, Soviet troops and tanks rapidly advanced as Soviet paratroopers secured key sites in Kabul. The Soviets insist they have been invited by the ruling PDPA government and once stability is restored, they will withdraw. Already the invasion is being met by international condemnation as many see the Soviet intervention and suppression of Afghan rebels as a blatant violation of international law."
 Brezhnev_POL.1.d:0 "Soviet forces have crossed the Polish border in order to secure the communist regime in Poland and crush the Solidarity Movement. Solidarity began as a shipyard strike against management for arbitrarily firing a worker but soon expanded into more strikes and expressions of anger at a stagnating economy. The Polish communists agreed to recognize Solidarity as the first independent Union within the Soviet bloc but the group has continued to question government policy. Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev saw this as a threat to communism in Poland and citing the Brezhnev Doctrine, authorized military action to end Solidarity and restore party discipline in Poland. Significantly, the Polish military and senior communist leaders are rumored to be upset and uncooperative with its Warsaw Pact ally. The Soviets apparently refused to let them resolve the crisis internally and now they fear the Soviet action will only strengthen the popular appeal of Solidarity."
 SOV_Detente.1.d:0 "The Soviet government recognizes the continuation of Cold War tensions has led to heavy military spending and a constant state of alert. The situation does not help the economy and hinders the ability for the government to provide for its people. In addition, maintaining a position of aggressiveness only causes our enemies and their allies to more firmly entrench themselves with one another. To change this, the Soviet Union had decided to embark on a campaign to soften its international rhetoric, more openly engage the United States and its allies, and try to reduce global tensions. This will allow the Soviet Union to focus more on its economy, improve its international standing, and by showing its softer side, it may be able to convince some of the neutral powers or even some American allies to re-align. The Soviet Union is looking to establish a period of détente or relaxation with the United States."
 SOV_VIN.20.d:0 "In a new diplomatic offensive being launched in the capitals of the major states involved in Vietnam and the United Nations, the Soviet Union is urging all sides to come together in peace. Soviet diplomats are emphasizing that the decades long violence must end soon and that the people of Vietnam have suffered enough. In addition to calling on America to reduce its combat operations, the Soviets also urged the South Vietnamese government to show restraint. However, in a shift from previous calls for peace, the Soviets urged North Vietnam to aid the peace effort by slowing the flow of fighters and engage peace talks with flexibility. Privately, some sources indicate Soviet diplomats have informed Hanoi that a failure to actively try to negotiate peace will risk a loss of Soviet aid. The Americans will no doubt appreciate this effort."
 SOV_Mid_FP.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union and United States are engaging in Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in order to discuss ways to limit and control the nuclear arms race. Both nations have immense strategic missile capabilities but the desire to update weapons systems and stockpile warheads are becoming very expensive for both nations. So far it appears the talks may succeed in agreeing on a freeze of current missile levels and limit the number of certain launch systems. Such an agreement would be well-received internationally and many believe such an agreement could pave the way for future talks which could ultimately guide the world towards denuclearization. Though many experts believe such predictions are overly ambitious or far into the future."
 ABMT.2.d:0 "The United States informed the Soviet Union that it had rejected the proposed Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty (ABMT). This a blow to Soviet efforts at trying to control spending and a new arms race. This decision indicates the Americans are planning on expanding its ABM research and is interested in finding a way to change the strategic parity currently in place. Soviet military leaders insist they have their own ABM research and will not fall behind the United States. In fact, one senior officer pointed out ABM is a very expensive endeavor and even if the Americans make advances, it would not be hard for an opponent to devise ways to overwhelm such systems with little effort or money. The Americans rejected these accusations and insist it will not compromise with foreign powers on researching technologies that can save American lives."
 ABMT.3.d:0 "The United States informed the Soviet Union that it has accepted the proposed Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty (ABMT). This is a great triumph for diplomats in both nations. The potential of an ABM arms race is now averted, and military departments in both countries will not have to expend resources on such projects. The big fear within the Kremlin had been that an ABM arms race could see the United States use its technological advantages to gain an unfair advantage. Such a scenario would have been destabilizing for world peace. Indeed, reports from America indicated one of the reasons they accepted the treaty is a belief that an American breakthrough in ABM technology may provoke the Soviet Union to strike first before it lost its advantage. Regardless of its reasoning, both the United States and Soviet Union are happy and hope the treaty marks a warming of ties between both nations."
 SALT_II.2.d:0 "The United States has rejected the proposals of the latest Strategic Arms Limitations Talks treaty (SALT II). The agreement would have seen both nations for the first time limit their arsenals, limit the development of new missile technologies, and reduce launch platforms. The rejection by the United States has puzzled some experts who note even the limitations in the treaty hardly weakened the capacity of either state to destroy the other. The Soviets are said to be infuriated and called the United States warmongers. However, an American diplomat involved in the decision-making process noted the decision had a lot to do with a recently discovered pattern of subversive actions by the Soviets, indicating they lack sincerity in terms of truly reducing the risk of global nuclear war."
 SALT_II.3.d:0 "The United States has accepted the proposals of the latest Strategic Arms Limitations Talks treaty (SALT II). The agreement will see both nations for the first time limit their arsenals, limit the development of new missile technologies, and reduce launch platforms. Experts note the agreement hardly erodes the ability of either side to strike the other, but it does mark an effort to halt the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the development of new delivery systems. The agreement is being lauded in both countries as a step in the right direction and hope it will lead to a warming of ties. Many hope such talks will continue in the years to come, eventually leading to nuclear disarmament. Both nations are said to be satisfied with the agreement and its implications."
 Sov_FP.125.d:0 "The Soviet Union recently shifted its foreign policy towards Western Europe. It has completely softened its tone. Instead of hostility or isolation, it has engaged these states in friendly exchanges which have facilitated a growth in trade, cultural, and political ties. With relations improving and many in Western Europe now optimistic for a future of peaceful coexistence, the Soviets feel the time is right to ask those states to end their post-World War II refusal to recognize the borders established in the Eastern bloc. Specifically, their has long been opposition to the East German and Polish borders. The Soviets will tell Western Europe that this keeps tensions high and if they recognize these borders, it will end a major stumbling block to European peace. If the Soviets achieve in getting an agreement on the borders this will also raise Soviet standing among its Warsaw Pact allies."
 Brezhnev.1.d:0 "For Leonid Brezhnev and his senior partners in the Soviet government, one of the greatest mistakes of the previous government was its tolerance to of multiple socialism. This caused may communist states to diverge from accepted Marxist-Leninism practice and away from the Soviet model. In addition, outside forces funded by capitalist interests often try to subvert regimes to facilitate a turn to capitalism. To combat this, Brezhnev announced a new doctrine being called the Brezhnev Doctrine. The Soviet Union has the right to militarily intervene in any socialist or communist state facing internal or external threats to preserve socialist society. National sovereignty does not supersede the interests of global socialism and the Soviet Union will act if needed. The new doctrine marks a flexing of Soviet strength. The vagueness of the language means only when it comes into practice will Soviet allies and enemies begin to understand the limitations and practices of the doctrine."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.4.d:0 "The defiant Romanian rejection of the Brezhnev Doctrine led to an emergency Warsaw Pact meeting. After consultations, the Soviet Premier, Leonid Brezhnev announced for the preservation of socialism in Romania, the Warsaw Pact would initiate military operations into Romania. He called on Romanian military forces to stand down and the people to come out and help their brother socialists in the liberation of their country from the tyranny of Nicolae Ceausescu. An immediate reaction was not given by the Romanian government. However, several outraged European states already stated they intended to bring the invasion to the United Nations. The Soviet action confirms its adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine that promises military action to support any socialist state facing internal or external forces threatening its existence."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.5.d:0 " The defiant Romanian rejection of the Brezhnev Doctrine led to an emergency Warsaw Pact meeting. After consultations, the Soviet Premier, Leonid Brezhnev announced the Soviet Union and its allies would continue its diplomatic pressure on Romania and continue to urge Romania to embrace proper Marxist-Leninist practices. The announcement has lowered regional tensions and fears of an impending Soviet invasion and many analysts believe the Soviet decision not to use military force shows the Brezhnev Doctrine has its limits. It is unknown of the Soviets decided to not act out of its own interests or if the Soviet leadership feared a military action against Romania would risk the defection of other Warsaw Pact allies who may not wish to participate in such an operation. Regardless, the whole incident indicates a limit to Soviet power and influence, which some are interpreting as evidence that the Soviets are losing control over the Warsaw Pact and global communism."
 SOV_Kashmir.1.d:0 "\nThe Soviet Union recognizes that India and Pakistan were both victims of capitalist exploitation and imperialism under colonial rule. To aid both countries they have recently offered to hold talks with the leaders of both India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. Both countries reacted positively to the idea. When talks do occur, there is very little chance of an actual breakthrough but their agreement to accept Soviet mediation showcases the increasing diplomatic power of the Soviet Union. The Soviets in their statement also added they harbored no agenda other than peace and hoped to learn about from both sides. The Soviets also stated it is a friend to all the people of India and Pakistan and will always act as a global force for good."
 SOV_PAL.1.d:0 "\nThe Soviet Union announced it wholly endorsed the Two State Solution as the framework for peace in the Middle East. The Soviet government stated any other solution would be unjust and lead to never ending conflict. The Soviets added such a solution should lead to a return of Palestinians to the homes they had been expelled from their homes. The Israeli government simply stated it expected the Soviet Union to respect its sovereignty and security. A Palestinian spokesman stated it appreciated any state that recognizes the right of Palestinians to return home, though the spokesman did not address the idea of an Israeli state. The Soviet stance is seen as a way to add some pressure on the Israelis to be more flexible with regards to future peace deals."

 #News Events
 Solzhenitsyn.1.d:0 "\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn was recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The acclaimed author is a vocal critic of the Soviet Union and its system of government. However, the Soviet government under Leonid Brezhev announced Solzhenitsyn would be forbidden from collecting his prize due to his anti-Soviet works. Solzhenitsyn served the Soviet Army in World War II but after the war was sent to the gulags for criticizing Stalin in a letter. Under the regime of Nikita Khrushchev, Solzhenitsyn was allowed to publish his autobiography about his time in the gulag, reflecting the height of the liberalization under Khrushchev. However, his successor, Leonid Brezhnev has reversed this liberalization and has used state agencies and the media to criticize Solzhenitsyn. He has also ruled through consensus and many believe other senior members are directing the harsh government stance on this matter. The international community and intellectuals across the globe are criticizing Moscow for its decision."
 DevSocialism.1.d:0 "Premier Leonid Brezhnev and senior party members are all discussing the Soviet Union as reaching the state of developed socialism. According the Moscow, the current economic structure and direction of the state represent the most advanced socialist society in the world. All other communist states must strive to achieve this status and must not deviate from the course. Across the communist world, this argument is seen as a criticism to other regimes who have diverged from the Soviet economic model in recent years. These states argue they must deviate to adapt their society to socialism. However, the stance of Brezhnev indicates the Soviet Union are looking to push all its Soviet Republics and the wider communist world to end economic deviations and emulate the Soviet Union as the center of global communist economic advancement."
 Brezhnev_Constitution.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union adopted a new constitution during the recently concluded Seventh Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The new document confirms the Soviet Union as a developed socialist state with a unified people undivided by national identity or even profession. The constitution argues the party now represents not just workers and peasants but all people within the Soviet society. More significantly, the new constitution erodes the autonomy of Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union and requires all to confirm to Soviet laws and accept the supremacy of Soviet sovereignty. Soviet citizens are also guaranteed fundamental rights, but with limitations. The document confirms many of the leading ideas propagated by the ruling regime of Leonid Brezhnev and many are already nicknaming the document the Brezhnev Constitution."
 Brezhnev_Pol.100.d:0 "The recent memoirs of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, regarding his World War II years has received the prestigious Lenin Prize of Literature. Although the memoir is regarded as poorly written and a glorification of his minor contributions on the battlefield, not many in the Soviet Union are surprised. Brezhnev has long shown an intense passion for ceremonies and receiving awards. He has been given over a hundred medals and it is now expected that his birthday celebrations include the conferring of new medals and ranks. The numerous awards and promotions he gives himself are joked upon across the country and although Brezhnev has apparently been told of public amusement at his obsession with awards, he has brushed it off. For Brezhnev, if the people joke about him, it means they like him."

 SOV_TUR.10.d:0 "\nThe Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union both had a strategic interest in securing control of the Turkish Straits. The loss of the Straits to a hostile power risked trapping Soviet trade and naval vessels in the Black Sea. In 1936 the Montreux Convention decided the Straits would be policed by Turkey and only ships from nations bordering the Black Sea could use it. After World War II, the Soviets cited examples of Axis shipping from Germany and Italy going through during the war as evidence the Montreux Convention needed to be re-written. These demands of concessions regarding the Straits along with territorial demands on eastern Turkey turned the dispute into an international crisis. Eventually Turkey sided with the United States and the conflict receded with the Soviets accepting the situation but pointing out it still believed the Montreux Convention had to be re-written. Perhaps eventually Turkey can be persuaded to return to a neutral foreign policy or even join the Soviet alliance."
 TUR_SOV.2.d:0 "The Turkish Communist Party, along with sympathizers across key institutions have launched a takeover of the country. Many Turks reject the country's lack of progress on more democratic reforms and see the crisis over the Turkish Straits as more evidence that the policy of neutrality has led Turkey to a position of potential disaster. The communists have found high support in urban areas by Turks who see the government has slowed down or failed to follow through on the modernization policies of the republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal. They wish to see the symbols of reactionary life, religiosity, and conservatism much more firmly uprooted. The new Turkish regime has announced its hopes of fulfilling Turkey's march into modern society. The United States is said to be stunned by these developments while rumors have emerged that more conservative, religious, and Kemalist elements in rural areas might emerge as a resistance to the new communist government."
 TUR_SOV.3.d:0 "The crisis over the Turkish Straits took a dramatic escalation. After the Turkish government refused to concede to the Soviet demands to re-negotiate the 1936 Montreux Convention or surrender its sovereignty over the Straits, the Soviet Union has launched an armed invasion of Turkey. While control over the Straits is a key objective, the Soviets also have territorial claims on eastern Turkey. The Soviet government announced its soldiers would unite Soviet peoples with their compatriots who had been separated by borders created by the reactionary Ottoman Empire and preserved by the current Turkish regime. The Turkish government has called on international support in responding to the Soviet's “naked aggression" and said Turks must rally to the cause. The Turkish government cited how the Turks forged their own destiny after World War I and said the bravery of that time must return for Turkey to triumph."
 Berlin_Blockade.2.d:0 "The United States Air Force has pledged it can and will keep the airlift going. Although the airlift has proven to be very stressful, certain changes will be implemented to improve efficiency. General William Tunner, who during World War II reformed the India-China air corridor and doubled air transport in that theatre was recommended to take command. The French also pledged they would construct a new airfield in Berlin. Plans are also being discussed to merge with the British Royal Air Force's efforts to improve efficiency and coordination. As long as the airlift continues to function, the hope is that the counter-blockade against Soviet administered Germany will push them to blink and give in. While West Berlin is suffering, the counter-blockade has put a lot of strain on East German industrial development. Politically the people of Berlin are expected to continue supporting the airlift efforts. The citizens following the case in Allied states have also been supportive so far and are expected to continue supporting this policy."
 Berlin_Blockade.3.d:0 "\nThe United States has announced it will remove the Deutsch Mark from circulation in West Berlin. The United States stated its decision was not due to pressure from the Soviets but from a desire to aid the long-suffering people of Berlin and not play politics. There has been some applause among pundits and politicians in the West who support the United States for putting the people of Berlin first and believe the initial airlift had achieved its goal of demonstrating Soviet threats will not cow Allied resolve. However, there has also been opposition and dissent from other corners who see the American decision as a capitulation to communist blackmail. The Soviet government has welcomed the United States for “coming to its senses" but did not announce yet when and if the blockade will be lifted. Berliners are optimistic the Soviets will lift the blockade and are thankful for the help thus far provided by the Western Allies."
 Berlin_Blockade.4.d:0 "The United States government has decided to halt the Berlin airlift and declare Berlin to be an open city. The Western Allies forces occupying the city have been ordered to withdraw and the Soviets have been asked to lift its blockade to facilitate the troop withdrawal. Berlin will be an open city. Reaction in the United States has been quite negative, the action is seen as a capitulation to Soviet blackmail. Many are asking if the US will give up on Berlin, why would any other country trust the United States if they are threatened by the Soviets. Others however, have pointed out Berlin was an enemy city only recently and risking a wider war over it makes no sense. West Berlin was untenable and not worth the effort to maintain. The Soviets have said they are considering their options and are expected to respond soon. In West Berlin, the mood has collapsed as many fear what will happen once the Allied forces withdraw. The sense of betrayal is palpable and tensions are rising between Allied forces in the city and locals."
 Korean_War_Sov.1.d:0 "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) had been established under the leadership of proven, popular anti-imperialist leader and communist Kim Il-Sung in 1948. In 1950, after securing approval from the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China (PRC), Kim launched an invasion of the Republic of Korea (RoK). Despite initial success, a heavy US military response and deployment has led to a ferocious assault by the United States on the DPRK. With Kim's position threatened, the Soviets recognize the massive American military response may eventually lead to a threat to the PRC and a roll back of all the recent communist and Soviet successes in Asia. More significantly, such a scenario would leave the Soviet Union vulnerable in the east. As a result of these considerations and of increasing United States military involvement, the Soviet Union has decided to enter the war on the side of the DPRK. The Soviets will help liberate Korea as well as defend the DPRK and PRC from imperialist aggression."

 TUR_SOV.1.d:0 "After World War II, the Soviet Union sought to renegotiate the 1936 Montreux Convention. The 1936 agreement had allowed Turkey to police the Turkish Straits and stipulated only ships from countries bordering the Black Sea could use the Straits. However, after the war the Soviets began making territorial demands on eastern Turkey and voiced displeasure over the administration of the Straits. Recently, the Turkish Foreign Ministry was handed a note by the Soviet government. The note demanded the 1936 agreement be re-written and that Turkey give up its control over the Straits, perhaps Turkey should accept Soviet offers to run the Straits jointly. The reasoning given for changing the treaty was the instances where German and Italian ships crossed the Straits during the war, which the Soviets felt showed Turkey incapable of policing the Straits. The Turkish government could respond to the note by accepting the Soviet demands over the regime control of the Straits but this risks communist infiltration and Soviet occupation of key locations. Or it can reject the Soviet letter as an attack on Turkey's sovereignty. Certainly, this may risk an escalation by the Soviets but with the United States interested in helping, it may be the perfect ally to protect Turkey from Soviet machinations."
 Berlin_Blockade.1.d:0 "Since the Soviet Union instituted a blockade of West Berlin following its anger at the Western Allies decision to introduce the new German currency, Deutsch Mark. The United States and United Kingdom decided to respond by instituting its own blockade to Soviet administered Germany and to launch an airlift to supply the people of Berlin. The only way the Soviets could blockade the air would be by shooting down the planes but the Soviets would not cross that line. Despite the expenses and hardships on aircrews and planes, the airlift has continued, however, so has the blockade. As American leadership meets, it must consider its options as the Soviets do not appear willing to letup on the blockade. One would be to continue the airlift, despite the strain the airlift was having on crews and planes, valuable experience has been gained and certain changes on the ground could help expand the operation and ease the pressure. A second option would be to give in to the Soviet demands and withdraw the new currency. This will bring much relief to Berliners but will be a loss of face. Finally, the city could be declared a free city, this would leave the pressure on the Soviets to open the blockade to allow Allied forces to exit."
 Stalin_Purge.2.d:0 "Lavrentiy Beria, the former NKVD head and current overseer of state security had proven to be a critical hatchet man for Joseph Stalin. He oversaw the Soviet nuclear program, the Leningrad Affair, and the dismantlement of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. However, Stalin was growing increasingly paranoid of Beria who was consolidating his own power while carrying out Stalin's orders. Stalin sought to cut Beria to size and focused on the Georgian Communist Party where Beria had his strongest powerbase. A series of fabricated accusations were levied against leading Georgian Party leaders, specifically accusing the Mingrelians (a Georgian ethnic group) within the party of plotting with Georgian exiles and the United States to lead Georgia out of the Soviet Union. The resulting arrests and trials through 1951 and 1952 saw Beria's supporters in the Georgian Party purged, including First Secretary Candide Charkviani. Although the purge was said to target Mingrelians, it did target some non-Mingrelian Georgians, like Charkiviani. Ultimately the purge was more focused on limiting the influence and power of Beria. Despite Stalin's attack on his powerbase, Beria still kept his Politburo position."
 Stalin_Jew.1.d:0 "The Jewish Anti Fascist Committee (JAC) formed in late 1941 under the leadership of Joseph Mikoels. It acted to spread pro-Soviet propaganda abroad and emphasize the lack of antisemitism in the Soviet Union. Members of the committee traveled extensively to the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada to raise financial and material support for the Soviet war cause. The committee was hugely successful in its efforts partly by establishing close ties with other national and international Jewish organizations. It raised awareness to the Soviet cause along with millions of dollars in support of the war effort. After the war the JAC worked with American Jewish organizations to publish information on the holocaust and Jewish participation in the war. This annoyed Moscow who saw these efforts as undermining the Soviet claim the war was a universal struggle for all Soviets. In addition these close contacts with American organizations made Stalin in particular suspicious of the JAC's activities. Joseph MIkoels, the JAC leader, was assassinated and leading committee members arrested in January 1948 under accusations of bourgeois nationalism, trying to create a Jewish state in the Crimea, and working for US interests."
 Stalin_Purge.1.d:0 "Soviet premier Joseph Stalin had long been suspicious of Leningrad and its soviet leadership. His old rival Grigorii Zioviev had his powerbase there during the 1920s and Stalin felt Leningrad soviets had a desire to shift the capital and political center back to the old imperial capital. Following World War II, this suspicion turned to paranoia. The Siege of Leningrad made the city's leaders national heroes and during the siege allowed them to operate independently of Stalin's directives. Following the war, Leningrad leaders gained more positions of power in the central government in Moscow, gaining the most power it had since Stalin's rise to power. Fearing this new base of political power and the rise of so many young politicians, Stalin decided to act. In January, 1949, leading Leningrad leaders such as Alexey Kuznetsov and Nikolai Voznesensky organized a Trade Fair. Stalin directed the media and security forces to attack the event and laid out a series of trumped up embezzlement and corruption charges to his Leningrad rivals. In January,1950 the trials concluded and six leading Leningrad leaders were sentenced to death. The Leningrad Affair allowed Stalin to eliminate a perceived rival powerbase."

Nikita Khrushchev led the Soviet Union for a decade and started their Space Program, led the Berlin Question, and of course supported Cuba for a Communist government. Nikita Khrushchev said that he wishes the USSR to live on and that Leonid Brezhnev would do a great job as Premier. Other countries around the World has been surprised by this move. What path will the USSR now take under Leonid Brezhnev? Peace or War?"
 newssovever.2.d:0 "Shocking news has come out of the USSR: Chairman Khrushchev has stated that Leonid Brezhnev has attempted to depose him. Khrushchev has stated that he has been betrayed by his fellow comrades and that this is a direct attack on the revolution. Brezhnev has countered this by stating that Khrushchev is unfit to be Premier due to him almost plunging the world into a third world war in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Both have rallied their supporters, calling on people to uphold the Union's Constitution by defending the rightful leader. A power struggle has become violent in the Union."

 newssovever.6.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has been granted asylum into Mexico and has been allowed to stay in a secret location. Khrushchev actually went to the Americans first for asylum, but they said no due to the bad relations and higher tensions it would bring. The Mexican Government however accepted him because of Mexico being known for a haven to escape from enemies and because America might get some help from their friend to the South. Leon Brezhnev said that the USSR will never allow Khrushchev again, and that he better be careful with his life now. Nikita Khrushchev is now in a secret location so that the USSR doesn't send KGB agents out to end his life. The Mexicans are calling this a great opportunity to have a friendship with the Americans and the start of a new era. What will happen to Khrushchev and the USSR now?

If what he said is true and we keep him, then the new USSR will hurt our relations and made tensions high. If we deny him asylum, then he will have to go somewhere else. Mexico would be a suitable place for him there if we don't want him. He however would make a great part in our government and his defection would help us understand Soviet communications, troop placements, and how the USSR works inside and out. He would be a great asset to have. "

The Americans however didn't want him because if they took him there would be higher tensions between the USA and the USSR, and also because American-Soviet relations would be severely impacted. The Americans sent him to us to ask us if they would take Khrushchev. Mexico has always been know a haven for people who are escaping other countries. Only over 30 years ago we had Leon Trotsky in Mexico City trying to avoid Stalin and the USSR. Khrushchev would also help us as a political figure and who knows the Americans might like us if we allow him to send Soviet secrets to them? What should we do?"
