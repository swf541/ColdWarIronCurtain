 IRE_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."
