 ic_generic60_events.2.t:0 "Worker's Rights Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.2.d:0 "The Worker’s Rights debates over the past three months have been intense. Riots, general strikes, and lobbying have all made national news these past few months. But now the dust has settled and the country’s lawmakers will make their decision.\nThe Pro-Employer groups claim that workers’ rights and mandates are obstructionist and immoral. The Pro-Employer groups claim that liberty and free association of labor will correct worker’s rights conditions and ensure everyone gets a good deal without government interference. Additionally, the Pro-Employer groups state that economic growth as a result of economic freedom will bring about better conditions than any workers’ rights laws ever could.\nThe Pro-Union groups claim that workers’ rights are vital to protecting them. The Pro-Union groups state that there is no way people can freely choose their jobs as there are not enough jobs available to ensure free flow of labor. As such, the Pro-Union groups state that Unions must be strengthened to act in defense of workers and a Workers’ Bill of Rights must be drafted to further restrict working hours while ensuring living wage, workplace safety, and good working conditions.\n The moderates, who call themselves the Labor Pragmatists, claim that fully choosing either side will bring the country to ruin. The Labor Pragmatists argue that unions must be strong enough to protect their workers but they should not hold absolute power as excessive demands would stunt economic growth and leave the country in a worse state. The Labor Pragmatists conclude that having moderately powerful unions, acceptable standards enforced by law, and reasonable levels of economic freedom will ensure a balance of growth and benefit."
 ic_generic60_events.3.t:0 "Environmental Outlook Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.3.d:0 "The Environmental Question has revealed unprecedented levels of insight into the psyche and desires of the population. How people think of the future and of their own desires has been brought to light and these debates will leave sociologists in the country busy for possibly the entire decade. While the lawmakers of the country will hold some sway, ultimately it is up to the people and their outlooks to dictate their behavior and the nation’s sustainability.\nThe Materialists desire economic growth, large amounts of luxury and consumption, and do not care for the environment. The Materialists believe that global warming is a myth, nature will always find a way, that life is pointless when spent in austerity, and the benefits of rapid industrial growth always outdo the consequences of unsustainability.\nThe Environmentalists are extremely eco-conscious and global-minded individuals. The Environmentalists are contented with few, extremely reliable consumer goods. They desire sustainability, environmental protection, and long lifespans foremost. The Environmentalists believe that global warming is an existential threat, that sustainable products are necessary for humanity’s continued survival, and that the ecosystem must be preserved.\nThere are, however, environmental centrists in the environmentalist debate. These centrists believe that taking extreme measures to preserve the environment in unnecessary and merely cutting down on wastefulness and preventing deforestation and extinction of animal species is enough. The environmental centrists believe the Materialists excessively wasteful and the Environmentalists too austere. As such, they desire a nation that takes only necessary steps to reduce excessive consumption and protect the environment."
 ic_generic60_events.4.t:0 "Gender/Minority Rights Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.4.d:0 "Amongst the most controversial and important topics, gender and minority rights affect an overwhelming portion of the population and dictate what these groups can accomplish.\nThe first group, the reactionaries, believe in the national enforcement of historical gender superiority in the country. This group also believes that national heritage is important to the country and that minorities are unimportant or undesired. This group claims that the majority group is superior. This group fears that anything else will result in a breakdown of the family unit, the introversion of children, or even the influence of minorities themselves.\n The second group, the progressivists, believe in positive action to promote gender and minority equality throughout the country. This means a massive effort on behalf of either the government or the people to encourage acceptance and a total breakdown of cultural norms and traditions. This group of progressivists believe that the only way to ensure equality is to encourage members of historically marginalized groups to reach their full potentials and overcome prejudice in society.\nThe third group, the conservatives, believe that minorities and both genders should be equal. The conservatives believe that positive action is both unneccesary and unnatural and that being equal in law and social outlook is enough to ensure that minorities will have equal opportunities in the country. Additionally, the conservatives believe that while both men and women should be able to achieve the same things with the same work and skill, the traditional family unit is best suited for raising families and maintaining societies and therefore voluntary association with the cultural norms is the best policy."
 ic_generic60_events.5.t:0 "Sexuality and Gender Acceptance Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.5.d:0 "Very rarely brought up before the modern era, the SAGA debates have brought a lot of traditions in our society into question. Global historical persecution of minority sexualities and alternate gender identities is being called into question and the reasonings behind them have been frequently examined throughout the debates. The only question now is how society will digest these issues and how culture will change in kind.\nThe first group, the traditionalists, argue that marriage is sacred and that there are only a predefined, historical amount of genders and the rest are simply delusions. The traditionalists desire to maintain repression of alternate sexualities and enforce traditional gender identities.\nThe second group, the progressivists, believe that positive action to rapidly advance the acceptance of LGBT+ groups. The progressivists argue that LGBT+ individuals must be treated as equals and measures must be taken to protect them in society from discrimination.\nFinally, the liberals believe that LGBT+ groups should not be discriminated against and should be regarded as equal members of society. The liberals believe that LGBT+ members are equals and should be treated as such."
 ic_generic60_events.6.t:0 "Militaristic Policy Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.6.d:0 "Fundamental to the survival of nations and amongst the most potentially destructive forces, the military and militaristic policies are crucial. The question of militarism deals with the very survival of humanity and no group can completely agree on which policy is best for the world.\nThe Pacifists believe that conflict as a means to an end is a ridiculous concept. They argue that by nature it is destructive, destroying what was to be obtained or giving room to grow that which was to be destroyed. They also claim that as civilized beings, the end of all armed conflict should be our primary concern. The Pacifists believe that war is an evolutionary dead end, as futile as it is wasteful.\n On the other hand, the Jingoists believe that the only true virtues are courage and discipline, and channeled properly they can overcome any obstacle. The Jingoists argue that the ability to project force is of paramount importance. They believe the only way to preserve our way of life is to make sure everyone shares it; willingly or not.\nThere is, however, another group that takes a balanced stance on the issue of war and the military. This group believes that war should be a last resort and should only be conducted when there is a legitimate threat to the nation and when all other options have been exhausted. This group of centrists believe that the government should maintain a robust military to defend the nation and that it should not be used unless it is necessary."
 ic_generic60_events.7.t:0 "Globalisation Debates"
 ic_generic60_events.7.d:0 "With the rise of information technology and modern transportation, the world is becoming more and more interconnected and interdependent. This has sparked a new debate on how the world should respond to economic globalisation.\nThe economic nationalists believe that the nation should be self-sufficient and not have to worry about the tides of the global economy. These nationalists argue that foreign investors will take income produced by the workers of the country and spend it elsewhere, crippling the national economy. Additionally, these economic nationalists claim that the country’s resources will be stripped, the workers of the country will not be given a fair share, and through-and-through, the country will be effectively scammed by a global economy.\nThe economic globalists claim that the world is a positive sum game and only good can come from different countries working together. The economic globalists dispute the economic nationalists by accusing them of being mercantilists and that their policies have been tried and failed. These economic globalists believe that global interdependence and an open economy to global investors and workers will bring on a great level of wealth to the country and ensure the nation will see prosperity for years to come.\nThere is a centrist group that argues that economic interdependence and national autarky are both destructive concepts. This group of individuals believes in moderate regulation on foreign investors barring them from excessive ownership, moderately capped immigration, and an economy fairly open to the world is the best policy."
