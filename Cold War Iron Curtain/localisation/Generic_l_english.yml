Riots, general strikes and lobbying, have all made the news.\nThe Pro-Employer groups claim that liberty and free association of labor will correct working conditions and ensure employment without government interference, and that economic growth as a result of economic freedom will bring about better conditions than any laws ever could.\nThe Pro-Union groups claim that workers rights are vital since there are not enough jobs available to ensure free flow of labor. As such, they state that Unions must be strengthened and a Workers Bill of Rights must be drafted to ensure living wage, workplace safety and good working conditions.\nThe moderate Labor Pragmatists claim that choosing either side will bring the country to ruin. They argue that unions must be strong enough to protect their workers, but should not hold absolute power, as excessive demands would stunt economic growth. They conclude that having moderately powerful unions, acceptable standards enforced by law and reasonable levels of economic freedom, will ensure a balance of growth and benefit."

They desire sustainability, environmental protection and long lifespans. They believe that global warming is an existential threat, that sustainable products are necessary for humanity's continued survival, and that the ecosystem must be preserved.\nThe environmental centrists believe that taking extreme measures to preserve the environment in unnecessary and merely cutting down on wastefulness and preventing deforestation and extinction of animal species is enough. They believe the Materialists excessively wasteful and the Environmentalists too austere. As such, they desire a nation that takes only necessary steps to reduce excessive consumption and protect the environment."

This means a massive effort to encourage acceptance and a breakdown of cultural norms and traditions. They believe that the only way to ensure equality is to encourage members of marginalized groups to reach their full potentials and overcome prejudice in society.\nThe third group, the conservatives, believe that minorities and both genders should be equal.

They believe that war is a dead end, as futile as it is wasteful.\The Jingoists believe that the only true virtues are courage and discipline, and channeled properly they can overcome any obstacle. They argue that the ability to project force is the only way to preserve our way of life, make sure everyone shares it, willingly or not.\nThere is however, another group that takes a balanced stance on the issue of war and the military.
