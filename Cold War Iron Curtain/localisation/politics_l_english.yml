 CWIC_ECON_PENALTIES.1.d:0 "To prevent a budgetary and payment crisis, the government will implement austerity measures. The measures were proposed by the International Monetary Fund as conditional for further support and essential for our economic well-being. Without these measures, the fiscal situation of the nation could turn into an economic catastrophe. Although these measures will cause hardship on many citizens, they are essential for the long-term economic health of the country."
 CWIC_ECON_PENALTIES.2.d:0 "The government announced it had defaulted on its payments. The news is already resulting in a national panic. Internationally, there are calls for the immediate implementation of economic reforms to proposed by the International Monetary Fund. With the economic crisis reaching a new decline, the country faces little choice but to carry out difficult cutbacks and try to restore confidence in the national economy. The crisis is seeing a number of businesses and government facilities being forced to shut down as they lack the funds to maintain operations."
