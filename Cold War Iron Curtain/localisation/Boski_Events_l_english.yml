 cam.1.d:0 "King Norodom Sihanouk has decided to dissolve the National Assembly led by Prime Minister Yem Samaur. Months earlier, Prime Minister Penn Nouth had been facing increasing attacks from the opposition over the rise in corruption and economic problems across Cambodia. He had been replaced by Yem Samaur, a former member of the Democratic Party and a man with close ties to the royal family and traditional elites. The Democratic Party then put pressure on the King to dissolve the assembly. Fearing the Democratic Party might seek to mobilize its street supporters, the King has agreed. With the National Assembly dissolved, Cambodia will be run by royal decree until new elections are held. Many in the country hope a new National Assembly will better reflect the people and ensure more stable governance in the future."
 CAM_Recognition.2.d:0 "King Norodom Sihanouk has increasingly recognized continued French control over Cambodian ministries and policies has led to widespread anti-French sentiment in the country. This in turn has led to criticism of the monarchy and the government for being complicit with the French presence in Cambodia. The King recently travelled to France and asked for complete independence. The French government refused and in response the King conducted an international tour of the United States and Canada. He argued for Cambodian independence as the best means of combating communist influence in the region to a receptive audience. Upon returning to Cambodia, the King organized massive public rallies for independence and blessed the formation of a new militia to fight for independence. He had also refused to return to the capital, however the French have recently returned several ministries to the government and have agreed to discuss Cambodian independence in the near future."
 CAM_Exile.1.d:0 "Following the dramatic coup led by Lon Nol and anti-Vietnamese riots in Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk has decided to remain abroad and not return to the country. The former King, in a radio broadcast, accused the new government of stealing power and urged Cambodians to rise up against the new regime. Prince Sihanouk is expected to stay with friendly governments close to Cambodia and organize international support for the return of his government. He is also organizing a government-in-exile and will likely also try to organize armed fighters to restore his rule. Although his initial broadcast did lead to protests in the capital, at the moment, the new government appears to be firmly in power, but Sihanouk appears determined to bring together forces to end the new government and restore his rule."
 CAM_Exile.2.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk returned to Cambodia today to resume the ceremonial responsibilities as the Head of State. The new ruling government in Cambodia recently offered him the position and called on the former King to return from his exile. Prince Sihanouk thanked the new government and the people of Cambodia for working together with him to end the previous regime of Lon Nol. Most Cambodians, regardless of political views, view the monarchy as a vital institution of stability and order for the country. They largely welcome the return of the former monarch, though there are many who believe he should limit himself to his ceremonial position and not seek to engage in politics as he has in the past. Many would like to see a ceremonial monarchy formally restored soon with Sihanouk restored as King."
 Rep_Cam.1.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that Governor Chhuon was plotting on organizing a coup against the government. The details were murky, and the Prince decided to wait to uncover more information. This ended up being a mistake as the plotters discovered the Prince new and immediately acted. The Khmer Serai fighters staged an uprising in the northeast. The Prince sent troops to quell it, but they proved ineffective. This increased the tension and unease in the capital. When the Prince tried to order more troops to move in, the military turned on the Prince for his failure to keep order. After the military secured key government institutions and politicians, they announced a new government, consisting of many anti-communists, will take over. The new government then proclaimed Cambodia will now be known as the Republic of Cambodia and its people will no longer be pawns of communist foreigners or an aloof monarch."
 Assasination_Nop.1.d:0 "Nop Bophann was a leading newspaper editor and a representative of the United Issarak Front was brutally gunned down in the capital, near the main military barracks. The United Issarak Front was an anti-colonial, leftist Cambodian resistance group which had waged war against the French colonial authorities. The assassination has angered many leftist and communist supporters across the country. It puts tremendous pressure on the Cambodian government who have been trying to maintain balance with communist and anti-communist factions operating in the country. Many fear the assassination had been ordered by anti-communist military officers who are seeking to destabilize the situation and force the government to act against communists by provoking a leftist response. However, supporters of the anti-communist factions note this could have been a communist plot to frame them and force the government to crackdown on their supporters. The assassination has raised instability and tensions across the country."
 VIN_CAM.1.d:0 "Senior representatives of the Republic of Vietnam and Cambodia recently signed a Mutual Defense Treaty. The agreement commits both neighbors to protect and aid one another from outside threats. Many view the treaty as a direct challenge to communist North Vietnam which has been accused of fomenting unrest and deploying troops in those states. Indeed, a spokesman for North Vietnam noted the agreement was one of two puppet regimes desperately trying to ensure their illegal regimes remain in power despite the wishes and desires of the people. However, both Cambodia and South Vietnam insist they are not disturbed by this reaction and this treaty reflects the shared interests and historical ties that bind both nations."
 Bangkok_Coup.5.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that Governor Chhuon was a main conspirator in the plot against his government. Prince Sihanouk decided to act immediately and deployed a battalion of troops to arrest Chhuon. Chhuon was eventually captured by troops who also detained an American citizen working with Chhuon. Under military interrogation, Chhuon began confessing but died quickly. He had not revealed all the co-conspirators and the Prince suspects Chhuon did not survive the interrogation because military leaders did not want to be implicated. The Prince knows the Khmer Serai was meant to be the military force to implement the plot and were working with anti-communist politicians. They and the Khmer Serai will be closely watched from now on. Relations with Thailand will be downgraded as they support the Khmer Serai and Sihanouk lodged a protest with the United States over their citizen being caught collaborating with Chhuon."
 
 Bangkok_Coup.1.d:0 "Since the end of World War II, the Cambodian government, led by former King, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has struggled to balance its relationship with communists, anti-communists, and traditional elites. This has frustrated many and those on the right, working closely with intelligence agents from Thailand and some say even the United States, are planning action to remove Prince Sihanouk. They want to replace the Prince and establish a firmly anti-communist regime to protect Cambodia from communist encroachment, especially from its neighbors. Former royal advisor Sam Sary, working with powerful nationalist militia commander Son Ngc Thanh and Governor Dap Chhuon are planning on using the militia, the Khmer Serai, to instigate a revolt in the northeast. From the chaos they would then seize power with the help of allies in the capital. Sary and Thanh are ready for action and are putting the plot into action..."
 Bangkok_Coup.2.d:0 "Prince Norodom Sihanouk was informed that militant fighters were raised in revolt in the northeast. He was not aware that this force as actually Khmer Serai fighters aiding the coup attempt by sowing unrest. The Prince initially thought of sending an immediate force to quell the unrest but instead he first chose to address the nation. He called on citizens to unite against the threat to Cambodia and supplemented the military force with local militia fighters. This proved decisive as they discovered the Khmer Serai fighters and quickly drove them back to their bases. The coup plotters had hoped the staged revolt would sow panic and force people and the military to lose faith in the Prince, facilitating the coup but instead Prince Sihanouk remained in power. Desperate, some military officers involved in the plot did try to launch a coup, but they failed and as they are interrogated, the full details and participants are being revealed. Mass arrests and detentions are expected to follow."

 destalinization.0.d:0 "The ascension of Nikita Khrushchev to the position of General Secretary of the Soviet Union marked the beginning of a new era. Khrushchev quickly decided he needed to relax the Stalin era repression, control, and aggressive foreign policy. Khrushchev is able to embark on this ambitious project of transforming Soviet society due to his ability to ally with powerful factions and place loyal supporters throughout the Soviet system. His background as a peasant also aids in his credibility. However, as Khrushchev works to undo the worst aspects of the previous regime, he will have to deal with ambitious rivals and staunch Stalinists who do not appreciate this campaign of openness, especially towards enemies of the state. Khrushchev believes an era of de-Stalinization will revitalize the Soviet Union in its struggle against the capitalist world."
 Khruschev.100.d:0 "Following the death of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev was able to mobilize his supporters more effectively than his rivals and secure power. Through an alliance with senior Red Army commanders and his appointment of young proteges to key appointments, Khrushchev outmaneuvered the conservative hardliners within the inner circle of Stalin. Prominent Stalinists like Lavrenty Beria have been purged while others were placed in the background before slowing being pushed into retirement. To replace these men Khrushchev has began promoting young, ambitious men who share his vision for Soviet society. Although these men may prove a challenge down the road, at the moment Khrushchev is successfully removing the hardliners and powerful old guard with a younger, loyal cadre of supporters who are years away from challenging him."
 Lysenko.1.d:0 "For decades the agricultural and biological theories of Trofim Lysenko have been the only acceptable theories on agricultural development. These theories, called Lysenkoism condemned geneticists and more scientific methods of agriculture as being capitalistic and incorrect. It rejected the concept of natural selection and the idea of the gene. With the approval of Stalin, Lysenko supporters detained thousands of biologists and geneticists. Any criticism of his work was condemned and punishable by arrest. However, in recent years the Soviet government, following the death of Stalin, has halted its support for Lysenko and now publications, including those associated with the state, are openly condemning Lysenkoism. This shift is being attributed to the new relaxation on censorship laws and many universities are now bring back scientific agriculturists and downgrading or removing Lysenkoism from the curriculum."
 destalinization.1.d:0 "In an address to the Central Committee, Nikita Khrushchev condemned what occurred during the Leningrad Affair. The Leningrad Affair was a purge of leading Leningrad Soviet officials by Stalin and his security services. At the time it was portrayed to the Soviet people as a plot by the Leningrad officials to seize power. Khrushchev in his remarks noted the charges against the Leningrad Soviet officials were either faked or fabricated by Levrenty Beria under the direction of Joseph Stalin. He called on the rehabilitation of the surviving victims of the Leningrad Affair and in his remarks criticized several powerful Stalinists in the Central Committee. Khrushchev has not only brought to light the victims of a false purge by Stalin but by implicating those Stalinists still sitting in the Committee, including his rival Malenkov, he has weakened them and strengthened his own position."
 VLC.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union agriculture sector has long been an area of concern for the government. Under Stalin, forced collectivization sought to keep peasants to the land but this harsh policy often led to disappointing yields, heavy loss of life, and peasant discontent. The regime of Nikita Khrushchev has decided on am ambitious project, called the Virgin Lands Campaign to greatly expand Soviet agricultural productivity by cultivating millions of hectares of previously uncultivated land. These proposed lands are located in lands east of the Volga to Western Siberia. In addition, Khrushchev will expand on agricultural reform policies to encourage productivity and improve the conditions of farmers. The ambitious plan has detractors concerned over costs and feasibility but Khrushchev will not be deterred from his goal to lead an agricultural revolution. The government has launched an aggressive propaganda campaign targeting young Soviet citizens to move as settlers to these lands out of patriotic duty. So far the response has been very positive."
 destalinization.2.d:0 "The new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev seeks to consolidate his rule and end what he views as the destructive policies of the Stalin era. As part of this effort, Khrushchev has ordered the release of millions of political prisoners from the dreaded Gulag prisons. Khrushchev noted many of those condemned were sent for very minor offenses or had served their time but were not released. The news has been well received across the Soviet Union, especially from party members, many of whom have friends or family that were sent to these camps under the order of Stalin. On a more practical level, he number of prisoners had grown to dangerously high levels and many reports of riots or uprisings from prisoners had been reaching Moscow. Khrushchev hopes to alleviate this potential unrest and gain political credit from many in the Soviet Union who applaud this action."
 #Sov_Missle.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union expanding its nuclear arsenal and delivery systems, the Ministry of Defense has decided to establish a Strategic Missile Force (SMF) as a military branch of the Soviet Union. The SMF will oversee all Soviet ballistic missiles, their organization, positioning, and will also be testing new rocket systems. New formations are expected to be organized under the SMF and the Soviets hope this branch will streamline development, production, and deployment of missiles. This new military branch reflects the increasing importance of strategic military weapons and the importance such assets have. Internationally, the SMF will be closely scrutinized as a model for how other nations with such weapons systems may week to organize them."
 Baikonur.1.d:0 "As the Soviet Union expands its ballistic missile program and engages in the development of new systems, the need for a test and launch side has grown. To resolve this need, the Soviet government has opened a new rocket test and launch site in southern Kazakhstan called the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The massive facility (coving 90 km) required the construction of new infrastructure and a new town to accommodate the required staff. More significantly, as the facility comes into operation, the Soviets have also designated the site as the main spaceport for the Soviet Union. Technology and rockets for the space program will be developed and launched from the facility as well. The facility is located close to the equator and its weather is said to be ideal for future rocket and space launches. The facility is being kept under intense security and secrecy to protect Soviet aerospace and rocket developments from hostile foreign powers."
 KGB.1.d:0 "The Soviet government had decided to reorganize its intelligence agencies and have established the Committee for State Security, or KGB. In the past, Soviet intelligence leaders have consolidated excessive power that at times threatened the Soviet state. This new organization is expected to prevent power accumulation and streamline not just domestic but also foreign intelligence operations. Different types of intelligence and regions will be headed by individual directorates who all answer to the chairman. This structural setup will prevent any one official from consolidating power and improve the efficiency of intelligence collection. The organization is acting as a successor to the successful World War II era NKVD and is expected to play a major role in securing communist rule and supporting communist efforts across the globe.."
 SOV_COL.1.d:0 "The long-oppressed peasants in Colombia have recently begun to organize themselves against capitalist exploitation. Their organization is called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC. FARC has started an armed struggle in response to the exploitation but also the political repression in Colombia which has seen populists and socialists silenced through violence. Soviet intelligence assesses the organization has potential and embraces socialist values. With this in mind, the Soviet Union has decided to send military aid to FARC and help it in its struggle. Soviet aid will even the odds and help the peasants defend themselves from the capitalist and violent Colombian state. Expanding Soviet influence in Colombia will also allow the Soviets to project its power in the western hemisphere."
 SOV_ALG.1.d:0 "The French have long exploited and abused the people of Algeria with their colonial project. Now the Algerians are fighting back with their organization, the National Liberation Front or FLN. The FLN organizes peasants and other exploited people and leads them in an armed struggle against a violent French military bolstered by local collaborators. The FLN promises a new regime of socialism and economic equality for Algeria. To aid this effort, the Soviet Union has agreed to begin offering aid to the FLN. Soviet support will be crucial in helping the Algerians standup against the modern French military. More importantly for the Soviets, undermining French rule and gaining Algerian support could prove vital in the long-term. More significantly, aiding the FLN confirms with the Soviets longstanding opposition to imperialism and its exploitation of colonized peoples."
 SovFlySub.1.d:0 "During the late 1930s the Soviet Navy explored the idea of designing and testing a plane which could then submerge, this was called the Flying Submarine Program. It was headed by engineer Boris Ushakov and although the program had early support, it was shelved before 1940 as the Navy concluded the proposed aircraft was unfeasible. However, the Soviets, under the direction of Lavrenity Beria restarted the program after the war ended. The Soviets recently built a test aircraft and the results are being assessed. Ideally, the flying submarine could potentially play a role in targeting vital enemy shipping. However, it appears the issue with the aircraft is its weight. More significantly, as enemies of Beria come to increasing prominence within the Soviet leadership, it appears unlikely that they will continue a program he started."
 TU_114.1.d:0 "At the recent World Exhibition in Brussels, the Soviets revealed a new passenger airline, the TU-114. This massive passenger aircraft is capable of transoceanic flights, has sleeping berths for passengers, and is the fastest propeller plane in history, capable of matching the speeds of jet airliners. The Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, eager to showcase this brilliant Soviet technology has decided to fly the plane on his visit to the United States. Although privately senior Soviet officials were concerned of trusting an aircraft still under development, Khrushchev insisted on taking it. Upon its arrival many in the international press were impressed by its size and capabilities, claiming it superior to any Western passenger plane currently in the market. The flight of the TU-114 has ended up being a major success for Khrushchev and his campaign to showcase Soviet ingenuity to the world."
 Khruschev_Agri.1.d:0 "The Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev comes from a peasant background and has viewed revolutionizing agriculture as a principle goal of his. However, he has chosen to ignore the advice of leading agriculturists, many of whom stated the government needed to invest heavily in agriculture and instead listen to Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko, a favorite of Stalin, has promised to create record agricultural growth with limited investment. The methods of Lysenko reject modern scientific methods, specifically from geneticists and botanists. Khrushchev, like Stalin believes his arguments. Unlike Stalin however, Khrushchev has not purged or detained those who oppose Lysenko and has allowed scientists to openly criticize him. However, despite the scientific critiques and the lack of results from what Lysenko has promised, Khrushchev continues to rely on continuing his traditional methods of Soviet agriculture."
 cpsu.20.d:0 "The twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concluded after meeting for over ten days. This is the first conference held under the leadership of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and he chose to make the Congress a condemnation of the Stalin-era purges and violence. Khrushchev on the last day of the Congress laid this out in a secret speech entitled On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences. In the speech Khrushchev accused Stalin of having a cult of personality and criticized his purges over imagined threats. The speech also implicated senior Soviet officials at the time who were instrumental in helping Stalin carry out his purges. The reaction to the speech has been mixed, many praise Khrushchev for speaking the truth while many hardliners or devotees to Stalin, the successful wartime Soviet leader, have accused Khrushchev of revisionism. News of the speech is expected to shake the communist world to its core."
 Doctors_Plot.10.d:0 "During his speech condemning the Stalin era purges, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev revealed the famous purge of doctors which occurred shortly before the death of Stalin was actually based on fabricated evidence. He stated the doctors were innocent and were only saved by the death of Stalin. Khrushchev stated that Stalin had told the judge trying the case to give guilty verdicts and beat the doctors for false confessions. More significantly, Khrushchev linked the plot to the antisemitism of Stalin along with the fabricated plot being the first step in a party-wide purge. The revelations by Khrushchev have stunned many as the press, under the direction of Stalin, had made the case major news across the country. Critics of Khrushchev note he was a senior member during this time and was complacent with the plot. They suggest he is only speaking up now as a means to strengthen his political position."
 APG_Fail.1.d:0 "Following the public denouncing of Stalin by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, he has provoked a lot of anger from Stalinist era officials and others who view Khrushchev as hypocritical considering his senior position during the purges he criticized. A faction of these men has formed a cabal that included Gregory Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Dmitri Shepilov, among others. The group tried to depose Khrushchev in a dramatic meeting of the Central Committee in which Khrushchev called the group the Anti Party Group. Before the vote took place, the Soviet defense minister, war hero General Georgy Zhukov threatened to destroy the Anti Party Group even if their vote succeeded due to their crimes under Stalin. However, the vote failed, and Khrushchev had to decide where to demote the Anti Party Group members to."
 KhruschevRel.1.d:0 "Born a peasant, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev always viewed religion with suspicion. He deeply embraced the Marxist critique of religion and saw it as a principle threat to the enlightenment and socialist development of the people. Khrushchev saw the lifting of religious restrictions during World War II as a mistake and upon taking power has launched a new wave of crackdowns on the Russian Orthodox Church. Many churches are being shut down, attendees of church services are being recorded, parents are restricted on what religion they may teach children, and children are banned from attending services. In addition to these new restrictions, priests violating any of the regulations are being swiftly arrested while those vocalizing complaints are also facing questions or detention by the state."
 KhruschevRel.2.d:0 "As part of the anti-religious campaign of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet government is closing a record number of Russian monasteries. Any members who complain or do not obey orders to shutdown are being arrested and prosecuted by the state for disobeying the law. In addition, the new regulations ban pilgrimages, which has hit some of the more popular monasteries. These closures are part of a wider crackdown on the Russian Orthodox Church. Sources in the government indicate the Soviet government maybe looking to close two-thirds of the existing churches from when Khrushchev came to power. The government states it is simply enforcing already established laws and point out the church has contacts with foreign groups and can act to undermine the Soviet Union from the inside."
 APG_Fail.2.d:0 "Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the leaders of the recent attempt to depose Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has been appointed the Soviet ambassador to Mongolia. This is punishment for his role in the plot after the Central Committee voted against deposing Khrushchev. The former Foreign Minister of Stalin and long-term senior Soviet leader has been banished and humiliated by this appointment. Khrushchev believes this is just punishment for his attempted overthrow and noted that under Stalin the punishment would have been far worse. Although Molotov has been defeated and the Stalinist era continues to be assailed by the Khrushchev government, he remains convinced that he and Stalin acted in the best interests of the Soviet people."
 APG_Fail.3.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich and Dmitri Shepilov were both senior party members involved in the recent attempt to depose Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. They had attempted to vote him out of power during the Central Committee meeting but the vote failed and they were defeated. After losing the vote, both Kaganovich and Sepilov have been sent to small industrial institutions beyond the Urals as punishment. These former senior party members have been greatly reduced in status and position. However, Khrushchev noted that if they had attempted what they did to Stalin the punishment would have been far worse. Time will tell if these two men can ever be reconciled with Moscow or if this marks the end of their careers."
 Khruschev_yug.1.d:0 "Relations with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia deteriorated rapidly after World War II. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin tried to force Yugoslavian President Josip Tito to obey his dictates. Tito refused and after several hostile letters to one another the relationship remained very cold. However, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has made reconciliation and positive relations with Yugoslavia a major objective of his foreign policy of friendlier relations. Khrushchev recently visited Belgrade and despite Tito initially showing hostility, a breakthrough was achieved and both men agreed to re-establish closer cooperation between the two communist states. Although the trip was a success, there are rumblings among other communist parties in the world that Khrushchev is reconciling with a regime that has a track-record of implementing a liberal communism. Supporters of Khrushchev counter that unifying the entire communist world is important in order to prevent capitalist exploitation of divisions."
 sinosovietsplit.1.d:0 "Upon taking power, the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to continue strengthening ties with the communist Chinese government. Soviet experts, aid, and weapons have greatly aided the Chinese in their efforts to rebuild the country following decades of war. However, recently the relationship has begun to breakdown following the decision by Khrushchev to de-Stalinize and condemn his predecessor publicly. In addition, the Chinese opposed Soviet efforts to improve ties with the West and with communist states seen as failing to implement proper Marxist-Leninist regimes. This tension came to a boil during a recent visit by Khrushchev to China, resulting in the Soviet leader leaving early. It finally ended in the Soviets withdrawing their advisors and China downgrading ties after the recent Romanian Communist Party Congress where both nations took public shots at one another. This Sino-Soviet Split marks a major division in the communist world and many fear the West may seek to exploit this to their advantage."

 KMT.10.d:0 "In the Republic of China, the ruling Kuomintang party has announced it will expel Lei Chen, a former presidential advisor and founder of the periodical Free China. Although Free China was founded as an independent publication free to discuss issues openly and act as a contrast to the harshness of the communist controlled media, the Kuomintang has found recent publications in Free China to be dangerous. Specifically, several articles have criticized the Kuomintang for not following constitutional procedures, especially in terms of term limits and the government felt Lei Chen was behind these criticisms. Lei Chen is a noted supporter of the constitution even at the expense of the Kuomintang and it appears this stance has cost him his party membership. He is expected to continue to champion his beliefs but now from outside the party."
 Formosa.10.d:0 "The 228 Movement refers to the mass killings and brutal suppression of Taiwanese protesters by the Kuomintang-controlled Republic of China on February 28th 1947. Protests against corruption and the assault of a widow by state officials resulted in the deployment of troops who killed thousands to end the protests. It also instigated a harsh campaign of repression against the Taiwanese people who were forbidden from discussing or remembering the events. This all increased tensions between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. Many Taiwanese have not forgotten and continue to see the events as a clear example of the corruption and brutality of the mainland Chinese Kuomintang. They also see it as proof as to why Taiwan must be free and independent to control its own destiny."
 Formosa.11.d:0 "In a stunning development in the Republic of China, the ruling government has collapsed to an uprising led by Taiwanese resentful at the domination and control of their island following the arrival of the Kuomintang from mainland China after their defeat during the Chinese Civil War. In previous days, across the island, especially in the capital Taipei, thousands took to the street. The government deployed police and military with orders to end the protests through violence but this only caused more people to join the protests. When the government ordered troops to use live weapons, this saw many troops refuse and join the uprising. Without the support of the military, the government surrendered with many fleeing to friendly diplomatic missions or the airport in order to seek protection or flee. Newspapers in the country have announced the success of the Formosan Revolution."
 Formosa.12.d:0 "The recent Formosan Revolution saw the island population from before the arrival of the Kuomintang in 1945 finally take control of the island for themselves. The successful revolutionaries recently announced the establishment of a new Provisional Government of Formosa to transition the island to a new era of inclusive and just governance. In the upheaval, some former government officials and supporters managed to flee but a large number remains on the island, especially refugees who fled mainland China and the communists there. For now, the new government has stated these people will be watched closely, those who committed crimes will be dealt with and once the government establishes itself it will decide what to do with the refugees. The statement was not seen as reassuring by the refugees and many Kuomintang supporters are also concerned about the sacred mission of liberating the mainland."
 Formosa.100.d:0 "The new state of Formosa recently announced in a national broadcast that it has rescinded all claims to mainland China. It stated the nation would no longer be devoting its efforts and sacrificing its resources for a cause that held little importance beyond the refugees and Kuomintang loyalists. Formosa is only concerned about the welfare, safety, and development of its own people. They added their hope that by washing its hand of these land claims it hopes to establish friendly, neighborly ties with the communist Chinese regime but it remains committed to defending its borders from aggression. A formal response from Beijing has not come but many analysts believe the Formosa announcement will likely not change the stance of the mainland Chinese government that the island is a province of China and should be returned to the country."
 KMT.110.d:0 "The Republic of China (ROC) and its ruling Kuomintang party welcomed a Presidential visit from American President [USA.GetLeader]. The visit to the capital is being intensely publicized by the island press to highlight the level of international support the ROC can count on in its struggle to liberate China. The two countries are expected to discuss expanding defense cooperation, trade, and the regional security environment. President [USA.GetLeader] is will meet leading government officials and is expected to visit cultural sites across the country. The communist Chinese government released its own statement condemning the United States for interfering with the internal affairs of China and reiterated that it would soon bring the rebellious island back. In a response, a ROC politician condemned the mainland statement and added that the visit legitimizes the Kuomintang government and will help silence critics of its goals."
 
 AntiRevBul.1.d:0 "The recent campaign of de-Stalinization and peaceful cooperation with non-communist states by the Soviet government has provoked a rise in anti-revisionist critique in Bulgaria. Critics of the new Soviet policies have condemned the Soviets for being revisionists.  and a threat to the proper implementation of Marxist-Leninist ideology. Even more significantly, the policy of Moscow to promote peaceful coexistence with the global capitalist powers and improving ties with communist states who do not fully embrace Marxist-Leninism is seen as weakening the revolution. The anti-revisionist critiques are spreading quickly in Bulgaria and is putting pressure on the Bulgarian Communist Party to openly criticize the Soviet Union and continue its practices. However, the party recognizes the continued need to Soviet support and is expected to reform leadership and governance along the new Soviet approach."
 Bul_Purge.1.d:0 "The Bulgarian government announced the execution of Anton Yugov for betraying the Bulgarian Communist Party and its ideology. This comes amid the background of a major purge within Bulgaria. Following the lead of the Soviet Union, Anton Yugov advocated changing the party to be more open, Bulgarian focused, and remove Stalinist influence. However, the old guard survived this new threat and remained in control of the government, rejected the idea of shifting party ideas. To solidify their continued control over the country they are purging the Bulgarian Communist Party of what they accuse as revisionists who seek to undermine the implementation of Marxist Leninism. Anton Yugov had been a senior leader of the party since World War II and served in senior posts up to his arrest and subsequent execution."
 Bul_Purge.2.d:0 "The Bulgarian government announced the execution of Todor Zhivkov for betraying the Bulgarian Communist Party and its ideology. This comes amid the background of a major purge within Bulgaria. Following the lead of the Soviet Union, Todor Zhivkov advocated changing the party to be more open, Bulgarian focused, and remove Stalinist influence. However, the old guard survived this new threat and remained in control of the government, rejected the idea of shifting party ideas. To solidify their continued control over the country they are purging the Bulgarian Communist Party of what they accuse as revisionists who seek to undermine the implementation of Marxist Leninism. Todor Zhivkov fought as a partisan during World War II and joined the party after. He held senior positions and was a staunch Stalinist hardliner until Moscow announced its new approach and rejection of Stalinist practices. However, this shift proved a mistake as the old guard retained power and has now purged him."
 Protivobalgarska.1.d:0 "The Bulgarian Communist Party has decided to reverse its post-World War II policy with regards to the Pirin Macedonia region. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had instructed Bulgaria to offer cultural autonomy to the region and recognize the population as Macedonian. This resulted in the Bulgarian state initiating a policy of declaring residents Macedonian and forcibly moving other declared Macedonians to the region in order to establish its cultural identity. Opponents to the policy were arrested or declared fascists by the state. Many residents in the region are noted as Bulgarian speakers and members of the Bulgarian church. The motivation for Macedonization were plans made to federate with Yugoslavia and the government even directed census authorities to identify the region as majority Macedonian to bridge with the neighboring Yugoslavian Macedonian region. However, now these plans have ended due to Yugoslavia splitting with Moscow and the region is being called Bulgarian once again."
 Bul_Purge.5.d:0 "Todor Zhikov has been dismissed from his positions within the Bulgarian government and is expected to be officially expelled from the Bulgarian Communist Party. The former World War II partisan leader and senior party member made a critical mistake by embracing the de-Stalinization and relaxation of state control called for by the Soviet government. Zhikov thought by following the lead of Moscow he could gain control of the party, remove the old guard, and garner public support at the same time. However, his attempt to take power in the Central Committee failed and his triumphant enemies have decided that Zhikov must be removed from the government completely. The allies of Zhikov are also expected to be removed from positions of authority in the coming weeks."
 Bul_Purge.10.d:0 "Traicho Kostov, the former head of the Bulgarian Communist Party was posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the party following a report by the Central Committee over the Kostov trial. Kostov had been arrested on charges of being an agent for Western intelligence agencies, undermining Soviet relations, and advocating nationalism at the expense of Marxist-Leninist unity. Following his arrest and execution, supporters of his in the party were also arrested and sentenced to long terms. The new embrace of de-Stalinization has seen the Bulgarian Communist Party re-assess these trials and establish commissions to look over these trials. They concluded that the mistake of the cult of personality led to the wrongful conviction of Kostov and his supporters. Those who were still in prison have also been released and rehabilitated as well."
 Bul_Purge.11.d:0 "The Partisan Faction within the Communist Party of Bulgaria has found its position increasingly sidelined within the party. The communist partisans who resisted the fascist regime and Axis forces were instrumental after the war in launching the communist-led coup that brought the Bulgarian Communist Party into power. The recent shift in Moscow towards de-Stalinization and peaceful cooperation has marked a shift across the communist world. In Bulgaria, this has seen the rise of a new group of leaders who advocate a change of the Stalinist old-guard and the implementation of a localized de-Stalinization within the country. This shift has resulted in the Partisan Faction losing influence and status within the party as they largely embraced the Stalinist line."
 AntiRevBul.2.d:0 "The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, in a surprise decision, announced it was embracing Anti-Revisionism. This marks a blow to the Soviet Union and its recent embrace of de-Stalinization and the friendly cooperation with capitalist states. Critics of this Soviet reversal of Stalin policies accuse Moscow of being revisionists. By embracing this position, the Bulgarian old guard has been bolstered and is expected to remain firmly in control of Bulgaria. However, the previous, warm ties between the Soviet and Bulgarian government will likely be negatively affected by this change. The Bulgarian government made it a point to mention that by embracing Anti-Revisionism, they are preserving the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the state."
 yugov.1.d:0 "The shift to de-Stalinization launched from Moscow has led the major communist parties across Europe to reassess their policies and structures. In Bulgaria, the old guard which has controlled the party since World War II by following a pro-Soviet, Stalinist line finds itself sidelined within the party. With de-Stalinization being the order of the day, the Bulgarian Communist Party announced it was appointing Anton Yugov as First Secretary. Yugo condemns the cult of personality and supports the development of a Bulgarian communism, independent of Moscow. In the past such views could have led to his removal from power and the party but with de-Stalinization embraced by the party, these views will form the basis of the party. The old-guard now faces criticism and their supporters will not view the appointment of Yugov as a productive step for the party. Yugov has also bested rivals within his camp who may have sought to take the senior leadership position for themselves."
 Bul_Purge.3.d:0 " Traicho Kostov, the former head of the Bulgarian Communist Party was executed by the Bulgarian government. He had been dismissed by the Central Committee and stripped of party membership several months ago. After his arrest, he was accused of deviating from Marxist-Leninism by embracing nationalism, undermining Soviet ties, and being an agent for Western intelligence agencies. During the trial, Kostov was not able to offer an effective defense and was swiftly found guilty. As Kostov was being tried, his supporters within the party were being arrested and put on trial as well on similar charges, they are also expected to be found guilty and sentenced to long prison sentences. Many believe the trials were show trials meant to purge the party of Kostov and his supporters and strengthen the pro-Soviet factions within the party."
 Zhivkov.1.d:0 "The new General Secretary for the Bulgarian Communist Party is Todor Zhivkov. The former partisan commander rose to senior party ranks after being placed in charge of the Sofia police force. Zhivkov managed to take the position of General Secretary due to the embrace across many communist countries of de-Stalinization after the Soviet Union announced its support of it. The old communist leadership in Bulgaria built their power along obedience to the Moscow line and Stalin but with that approach now criticized in Moscow, their position became untenable. Zhivkov managed to help maneuver the old leadership out of power and position himself as the top candidate to the position. He is expected to initiate policies and reforms to establish a Bulgarian version of communism which is hoped to not just revitalize the party but gain it support across the population."
 Bul_Purge.4.d:0 "The General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Valko Chervenkov has been removed from office. Chervenkov spent years in Moscow undergoing education and training. He led propaganda efforts during World War II and joined the government afterwards. He outmaneuvered his opponents and eventually merged his role as party chief with the position of Prime Minister. He adhered to the Soviet line of Marxist-Leninism, economic, and social development. However, the shift in Moscow towards de-Stalinization left his position untenable as Chervenkov was one of the most obedient adherents to Stalinism. With opposition in the party increasing and the popular support declining, Chervenkov had little choice but to stepdown and be removed from the government. He remains a party member but is not expected to have much of a voice with the state. A new era of Bulgarian communism has begun."
