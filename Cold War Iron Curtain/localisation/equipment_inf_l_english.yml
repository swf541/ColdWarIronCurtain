 FIN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Military Rifle M/39, nicknamed 'Ukko-Pekka' after the former President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the rifle was designed as a compromise between the Army and White Guard, adopted so as to standardize the Finnish Mosin–Nagant production. The M/39 was derived largely from the M28-30, but included some alterations proposed by the Army. The M/39 also incorporated a semi-pistol grip into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin–Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the Winter War, but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the Continuation War. Small numbers were also assembled from leftover parts in the late 1960s through 1970."

Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier’s movement.

In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74’s improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies.
