 fra_news.1.d:0 "On December 27, 1958, an order was made that \"from a date to be fixed by decree, and no later than January 1, 1960, a new French monetary unit shall be created, the value of which shall be one hundred francs\". The new unit is \"designated by the term new franc\". This monetary reform is the most public part of an ambitious program, prepared by Jacques Rueff, which advocates fiscal consolidation to end inflation and promote the economic and financial renewal of the country. With an external value of the franc fixed at 1.8 milligrams of fine gold (180 milligrams for a new franc), France is associated with the return to the convertibility of European currencies and can thus participate fully in the launch of the major construction site. European Community construction."

Leader Pierre Lagaillarde would orchestrate thousands of people taking to the streets. What started peaceful would turn violent as police began firing into the crowds. Government buildings were quickly overwhelmed as any sense of order was quickly lost. By February 1st, De Gaulle's loyalists would move into the city and restore order.

 fra_news.21.d.fal:0 "In the midst of the Algerian War, secret negotiations between the FLN and De Gaulle angered French Algerian generals who felt as if the European Algerian Population was being betrayed. Led by Maurice Challe, French colonial troops would attempt to stage a coup across Algeria's three major cities but would find little soldiers who would support it. In Oran and Constantine, the coup wouldn't even begin as officers and soldiers alike refused to take the orders. The day after, De Gaulle would make an inspiring speech which would further mitigate the support of the coup. The Putsch would fall into quick collapse as all involved would switch sides back to the government.\n \nBy the end of the ordeal, the coup failed miserably with nothing to gain from the attempt. The incident has proved that France stands by De Gaulle, even in the nation's times of struggle."
 fra_news.21.d.suc:0 "The fighting in Paris would finally settle down as the few remaining Gaullist and Communist Fighters scattered throughout the city would surrender. After a brief manhunt, Charles De Gaulle was finally captured at Rouen while attempting to reach Le Havre in an effort to escape to Britain. The trial of De Gaulle is quickly in progress, who is being tried with treason by the Putschists for the betrayal of French Algeria. Leftist groups across France have not fared better, with reportedly over 5,000 French socialists and communists being arrested. The Radical Party and Gaullist Party have both officially been outlawed, any connection with them could be met with the police at one's door. The streets of Paris speak volumes for the nation as a whole, as the once boisterous atmosphere has turned somber. Parisians walk past rolling tanks on their way to work, hearing occasional distance gunfire. People continue to move on with their lives, even during the end of the new Fifth Republic.\n As the dust settles, the future of France remains at a balance. Will this be a transitionary stage to the Sixth Republic or a new dawn of French authoritarianism? One thing is confirmed, the Algerian War is far from over..."

But very quickly, it is his wife Jacqueline, 31 years old, who freaks the gazettes. Parisians have eyes only for her \"elegant outfits\", her Camembert-shaped hats, her \"laughing eyes\" and her little girl's voice. Better yet: she has French blood, as evidenced by her first name and her maiden name (Bouvier). Kennedy also understood : the star is Jackie. And he makes up for it: \"I do not think it is superfluous that I introduce myself: I am the guy who accompanies Jackie Kennedy,\" he slips on Friday in the preamble of his speech to 500 journalists.
