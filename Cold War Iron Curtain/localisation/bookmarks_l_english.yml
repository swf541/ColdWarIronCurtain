 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Iron Curtain"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not long ago, the greatest threat to world peace was Germany. Now the United States and the Soviet Union are starting to compete for world influence. With the formation of new puppet regimes in Germany & Eastern Europe, these 2 blocs are a danger to any nation wishing to remain neutral. Who shall prevail?"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The era of British Imperialism has come to an end. The allure of independence is far too great for those subjugated under the British crown. Her colonies around the world are seeing increases in popularity for Nationalist and Communist movements alike. As the United Kingdom's global power wanes, it looks to its Western allies to safeguard against the threat of Communism, now closer than ever. Long gone are the fears of Oswald Mosley, now the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finally free of both US and Japanese occupation, the newly established Republic of Korea was hopeful for peaceful reunification with their separated countrymen above the 38th parallel. But after the suspicious assassination of the only senior politician willing to negotiate with the North and the staunch anti-Communist Lee Seung Man winning the presidency, that hope was waning fast. The US may have handed over the keys but neither Korea is in control, and with both republics claiming the peninsula conflict is inevitable."
 WGR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The once great German nation has been defeated once more. With the glory of the German empire just a distant memory, and the euphoria of their conquests just years earlier marred by shame and frustration, the German people once again find themselves at the barrel of a gun. Occupied by both superpowers of the world, they are the chess board for their political games. Tired are the people of Germany, with a great deal of rebuilding to do. All that's left is hope for de escalation and reunification with their Eastern brethren."
 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under Soviet Military governorship, the people of East Germany find themselves under the rule of the very people they oppressed. Morale is low, but things are looking up as plans are in place to create a German Democratic Republic. With Soviet leaderships, construction is making good progress, but life is difficult as the society has become strictly regimented and the full blame of the war is laid upon their shoulders. Already, large portions of the population have adopted the Communist ideology wholeheartedly, creating an ideological divide between the two Germany’s that may last for generations…"
 KPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shortly following the declaration of the Republic of Korea, revolutionary Kim Il Sung along with the Soviet Civil Administration have drafted the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Now independent of Soviet control and with borders with two powerful Communist nations Kim is poised to liberate his comrades below the 38th parallel. With Soviet equipment, Chinese manpower and a unified population under the Juche system, the War for Korean Reunification should be a cakewalk. After all, their guardian, the United States, is busy with bigger problems…"
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People’s Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the People’s Republic is prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Ze Dong following the Great March has allowed Chinese Communism to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thanks to the sacrifice of millions of brave Communists, Fascism has for the most part been wiped off of the Earth. But behind the fallen monster hides an even greater threat. The threat of Capitalism. Only having just liberated themselves, the Soviet Union must stand up to protect the world from yet another imperialistic system. The people of the world require a strong guiding hand, and there is no better candidate than the Soviet Union. Communism is gaining momentum, and Joseph Stalin intends to keep it that way."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the United States victory in the Second World War, it has positioned itself as the champion of Western Democracy. Strongly upholding its Capitalist values, it vehemently opposes the Communist East, led by the Soviet Union. Instead of demilitarizing after the destruction caused by WW2, the nation's military continues to grow to face the red menace. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States and the West truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Zionism has finally been realized and a Jewish state has been established. Although the first few years were marred by the Arab-Israeli War, the Israelites with the help of their Western allies have not only fought off the Arabs but seized additional land. The Holy Land is splintered and surrounded by hostile forces but the Jewish resolve, hardened by the holocaust, is resilient. Not since before the Romans had there been an independent Jewish state, and the Jews do not intend to let this opportunity slip through their fingers."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948, Tito’s model of Market Socialism was working well with funding from the United State’ Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia, while being greatly damaged by Italian and German occupation found themselves with a better quality of living than any other Communist state. However, their political stability was something else entirely. Tito was beloved by his countrymen, but his strategy of neutrality was despised by both East and West. With constant threats from both sides, can Yugoslavia maintain itself as an independent Socialist country?"
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Iraq stands in a position to do much in the Middle East despite its loss in that war, yet it faces a problem with Kurd rebels, most recently inspired by Mustafa Barzani's revolt. Iraq depends upon the British which have access to their oil through the Iraqi Petroleum Company in exchange for aid. At this Hashemite court, there is great conflict between the new "free" military officers and the old monarchist court that must be resolved."
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt is said to have achieved independence in 1922 however a large portion of the population do not believe this to be true in anything more than name. King Farouk is seen by many Egyptians as a key instrument to British control over the Suez Canal. There is opposition to the reigning monarch in all circles; government, civilian and military. It is the will of Egyptian and Pan-Arab nationalists to liberate the Suez from British hands. The continued rule of King Farouk looks unlikely without extraordinary British support."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japans imperial ambitions were crushed by the allies. Now under American occupation, this former imperal power is now trying to recover from the devestating firebombing campaign it faced during World war 2. How will Japanese future look? Will they be embrace the new democratic path or do something more radical?"
 OTHER_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Second World War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 DECADE_CRISIS_NAME:0 "The Decade of Crisis"
 DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Cold War is continuing to heat up. The United States and the Soviet Union are fighting each other in Africa, Asia and Latin America through proxy wars, while a so called domino effect is hitting Asia. Will the wave of communism be stopped, or shall Asia succumb?"
 OILCRISIS_NAME:0 "The Oil Crisis"
 OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "The world is about to fall back on its knees as the Egyptian government looms ever closer to an invasion of Israel. With threats of oil prices rising the governments of the world must do as they must to prevent this inevitable situation of economic recession."
 USA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United States of America is a major player on the capitalist block. After Cuba and China fell completely into communism, they are willing to intervene in every way to stop communism rise in other Asian countries or in Latin America. They have recovered western Europe and secured capitalist dominance over it, now it is time to secure capitalist dominance over the world."
 SOV_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has de-Stalinized their politics and stabilized their internal problems. Now focusing on exploring space and getting their influence across by uniting the workers of the world and implementing communist government on many countries. The Soviet Union is rising. Will the economic growth, and political dominance of the USSR continue or will the Americans turn the table?"
 DDR_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The German Democratic Republic, under Ulbricht has continued to follow the Soviet Union on most of its matters with relative success. However, as the new decade comes, the GDR is still plagued by many problems, most notable being the Republikflucht, in which the citizens of GDR escape to west. Along with economic and internal problems, Ulbricht must act soon or risk being ousted, or worse."
 PRC_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The People's Republic of China emerged victorious from the Chinese civil war. With the Kuomintang banished to Taiwan, Mao has focused on his vision of making China great. During this however he has faced many obstacles. Will Mao succeed or will he be forgotten to history?"
 CUB_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Cuba, now under Castro turned communist just a year ago. Unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. While the US first reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. It remains to be seen what the future brings. It sure won't be peace."
 VIE_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955, with Ngo Dinh Diem as its first president. A total opposite to the communist North, the south is supported by the US. The situation resembles the Korean situation. Will this lead to war as well?"
 FRA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of France has just reformed under De Gaulle as the Fifth Republic, which emerged from the collapse of the Fourth Republic, replacing the former parliamentary republic with a semi-presidential system. De Gaulle, who was the first French President elected under the Fifth Republic in December 1958, believes in a strong head of state, which he describes as embodying l'esprit de la nation ("the spirit of the nation")."
 ENG_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom, with the recent Suez crisis is in a tight spot. With rising independence movement, many expect to see the end of the British empire soon. Along with the crumbling empire, the country has seen the rise of communism which could develop into a bigger problem."
 ZIM_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Since 1953, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have been in a unstable federation. Now, with the new centry, many are wondering will the federation last or collapse? Increasing nationalism in all three subjects might be too tough to handle."
 1990_DESC:0 "The end of communism is near. With increasing desire to join the west, many communist couintries are about to change their governments. With the svoiets in bad shape, they ."
 1945_DESC:0 "The most devastating war in the history of mankind is finally over. Germany & Austria are occupied by the UK, the USA, France and the Soviet Union, while Asia erupts into chaos following the surrender of Japan. Fascism is finally defeated, but communism is now rising."
 YUG_1990_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia is falling apart. Since Tito's death, ethnic tensions have been rising across the nation. Now, with the start of a new decade, these tensions might escalate into violence. Will the balkans be on fire once more?"

 SUEZCRISIS_DESC:0 "The world is once again close to a total war. As Gamal Abdel Nasser has nationalized the Suez canal, some nations are seeing this as a conflict agaisnt their intrests. The British and the French more specificly. However, Israel might also get on board with the plan. The question is; What happens next?"
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the end of the Infamous Decade, the approval of women's suffrage, and the election of Peron, Argentina seems to be on course to democracy.  Peron is midway through his presidency, and already it seems that he will shake up the Argentinian economy and its people."
 VIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vietnam has been abandoned by the French. All attempts at independence have failed. Bao Dai, the Japanese collaborator, is the enemy of the Viet Minh once more. The blood spilled in the razing of Hanoi by Chinese imperialists will be repaid in French blood. Vietnam's struggle is now one against Western imperialism, and Ho Chi Minh now looks towards communism to win his battles."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France is heavily split. From the Renault Strike in 1947 to the bread riots of Le Mans and Verdun and the occupation of communist newspapers, the country is ready to fall into chaos. It must also face rebellions in Madagascar and Indochina, but must ensure that its home does not fall into rebellion as well. Rationing and strikes have characterized France this far, but it is impossible to ration a country forever. Will France and its empire endure or fall?"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second World War was traumatic to Spain. Francisco Franco watched as his fellow fascists fell in battle against the Allies. The Falange still controls the Spanish population, and with the beginning of the Cold War, it is unlikely if anything in Spain will change. Authoritarianism has kept Spain stable yet isolated, and few want change, but there is always the chance of change."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The eyes of both East and West have focused their gaze on Greece. The effects of the war have not worn off for Greece; the economy is sluggish and the country is more divided than ever. In the power vacuum left by the Italian surrender, Greek communist partisans rose up in the hopes of creating a new, Soviet-aligned, Hellenic nation. The Greek Civil War has been transformed into a proxy war between the Warsaw Pact and the former Allied Forces. Stalin is quite clearly eyeing up Greece as a bastion of Soviet influence in the Aegean sea but the legitimate Greek government shall do everything within their power to preserve the freedom and sovereignty of its people."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Eight Years War Of Resistance has finally ended with the explosive finale to Japanese imperialism. This is, of course, cause for much celebration - but the Kuomintang government cannot afford to celebrate to the point of distraction. There is still great danger to the nationalist governments, for with the lack of threat from Japan, China has become divided once more. Thanks to Soviet help, the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong have greatly expanded the territory they occupy, to the point of being a dangerous rival to the ROC. For now, the Chinese Civil War rages on and every effort must be spent on crushing the communists."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The feverish pitch after the death of Mussolini has subsided. The declaration of the Republic in 1948 is a high point in this new Italy, but it must still deal with the small impacts of occupation and the growing Communist movement."
 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iran has suffered much after the occupation by Soviet and British forces for five years and the removal of previous Shah Reza Pahlavi from power. His son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, became the British-endorsed replacement. The mild Shah would do little in his first years in power, leading to the creation of a loose democratic body. The prime minister and parliament now hold considerable power over the nation with the Shah taking a backseat in politics. As Iran enters into a crossroads to a new era, will the country, struggling with internal and external conflicts, continue on its path of democracy or be subdued by the many adversaries of the fledgling government?"
