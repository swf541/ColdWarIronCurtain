 congo_mutiny.1.d:0 "Though the Congo formally declared independence from Belgium on June 30 1960, the day to day of the ex colony has remained mostly the same, with many of its colonial institutions still operating in the state. One of these institutions, the Force Publique, has been the focus of significant backlash in the Congo. Although Belgium has formally withdrawn from the colony, many high ranking officials in the Force Publique have remained Belgian, much to the chagrin of the black members of the force. These tensions came to a head today when several all black units mutinied against their Belgian officers in response to Commander-in-Chief Emile Janssen's declaration that the situation after independence would not change from before independence. These units pushed several miles through the Congolese countryside, taking many Belgians hostage and recruiting more soldiers. Although Janssen attempted organise troops to crush the mutineers, the new government instead favored negotiations that have resulted in the reformation of the Force Publique into the Armee Nationale Congolaise, as well as the expulsion of Belgian officers."    
 mobutu_cos.1.d:0 "\n\nMobutu, the Congolese garrison officer, is being appointed today as the chief of staff of the Congolese colonial garrison. In an attempt to Africanise the garrison’s leadership to ease tensions with the soldiers, Colonel Mobutu was appointed as the Chief of Staff. His appointment was widely accepted by the ministers in charge of the appointment as the other candidate Maurice Mpolo isn’t trusted. Fearing that Maurice may enact a coup d’etat because he held influence with the mutinied soldiers, Mobutu has been entrusted with the position instead."     
 lumumba_deposed.1.d:0 "Lumumba, the first Prime Minister of the Congo, has been deposed after a few months in power. Dissent and discontent have been spreading in the Congo for a while now and mutinies have only been getting worse.\nMobutu Sese Seko, the Chief of Staff of the Congolese armed forces, with the support of the US and Belgium, has just arrested the first Prime Minister. Lumumba is currently being taken to Port Francqui in the south of the Congo."   
 un_congo.1.d:0 "A few days after the Congolese mutiny, Belgian troops invaded the Congo in an attempt to restore order due to Tshombe’s secessionist forces are growing stronger. This has led the first Prime Minister Lumumba to appeal for a UN intervention to resolve the situation. Lumumba is stating that the invasion of Congo by Belgian forces is an act of unwarranted aggression and an attempt to reinstate the colonial control of Belgium over the Congo. Additionally, Lumumba has repeatedly petitioned the UN forces to subdue the rebel government led by Tshombe.\nThe UN is expected to respond within a few days."       
 un_congo.2.d:0 "The Congolese government, in a security meeting with other members of the council over the post-colonial situation in the Congo, is stating that the UN is incompetent. Upset over the UN security force’s inability to ensure order or to expel Belgian forces from the area, Lumumba has protested by stating the UN is incapable of resolving the situation. The UN declared in response that they will urge the Belgians to speedily withdraw their troops from the Congo."       
 congo_un.20.d:0 "As months go by without a clear resolution, the Congolese government has accused the UN of siding with Tshombe and foreign mining companies. The Congolese government, today, is demanding that UN forces withdraw from the country and stop interfering with the country.\nThese demands stem from months of disagreements between the Congolese government and the United Nations over the peacekeeping mandate; specifically on the issue of Katanga. The UNhas adamantly refused to retake Katanga claiming that it is an internal matter and they are forbidden to intervene due to Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.\nThe Congo is currently petitioning the Soviet Union for immediate security aid to deal with the situation."       
 un_congo.3.d:0 "The Congolese government has issued an ultimatum to the UN to immediately withdraw their forces. Infuriated by the growth of UN forces in the Congo and the refusal of UN troops to suppress the Katangese secession movement, the Congo has issued a final ultimatum to the UN to withdraw immediately. If this demand is not met, the Congo will receive Soviet aid and mount an attack against the secessionist province of Katanga."      
 belgium_congo.1.d:0 "Infuriated by the Belgian incursion into the Congo and unsatisfied with the excuse of them being there to protect Belgian nationals, the Congolese government is demanding that Belgium immediately withdraw their troops from the Congo.\nTensions have continued to mount as Belgium has increased the size of its local garrisons in the region. The Congolese government fears that they may reinstate colonial rule or coerce the Congolese government.\nThe Belgian government has responded by restating their purpose and are saying they will withdraw as soon as they can ensure security or be replaced with a UN garrison that can do the same."    
 lumumba_death.1.d:0 "Though execution sounds like a clean word, the death of former Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba is anything but. Over the months of December 1960 and January 1961, Lumumba was sent through hell, underfed and "living amid absolutely impossible conditions" in Camp Hardy, until soldiers even refused to work. He would eventually be restrained and flown to Elisabethville where he would be beaten and tortured by both Katangan and Belgian officers, until he and two others were executed by firing squad on January 17 1961 with Belgian officers present. In order to get rid of the bodies, the executioners dismembered and boiled away the bodies in sulfuric acid, then crushed and scattered the bones. Although the Katangan government officially stands by their three week late report that he was killed by angry villagers, people from Belgrade to New York City are up in arms over this tragic and tyrannical display."    
 mobutu.2.d:0 "Lumumba’s Sovereign Guard have prevented a coup and killed Mobutu. Fearful of an attempted coup by Mobutu, Lumumba secretly assembled a secret service special forces unit known as the Sovereign Guard of the Congo. The Sovereign Guard of the Congo have members hand picked from the best of the Congolese armed forces and trained by the Soviet Union. Lumumba assigned the guard to defend him and be ready to strike against Mobutu if necessary.\nOn the day Mobutu launched his coup, the SGC picked up a confidential note of the attack and assembled an ambush. En route, Mobutu’s force was ambushed and overrun by SGC forces armed with modified Soviet flamethrowers. The SGC, under cover of smoke, managed to douse Mobutu’s force in fire. No SGC members were killed and Mobutu perished in the flame with his close loyalists.\nLumumba has declared an immediate state of emergency and is organizing a force to drive out illegal foreign corporations and enemies of the Congo. The counterattack itself has brought massive political gains and is drawing patriotic recruits and regional mercenaries who are too scared to work for Lumumba’s enemies even for a higher price."       
 mobutu.3.d:0 "The ONUC is currently cracking down on all mercenary units within’ the Congo.. The UN has issued a resolution calling for the total withdrawal of all Belgian and Katagan mercenaries units in the Congo. The ONUC has been given a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encounter them.\nThe UN has released a statement on the matter saying that mercenary units are a threat to the stability and peace of the Congo. This has surprised many because the ONUC’s original mandate prevented them from taking sides and this action directly conflicts with that mandate. It is unlikely that such an action will not be met with resistance and is likely to face conflict in the near future."       
 zaire.1.d:0 "During the Congo Crisis from 1960 to 1965, the newly formed Republic of the Congo was engaged in continuous local conflicts with Belgian-backed separatist movements and various rival governments. After political turmoil following the 1965 elections, Colonel Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and assumed total control of the former Belgian Congo. Despite promising to restore democracy, he dissolved parliament and abolished the position of Prime Minister, and in 1967 he founded the MPR, which was the only legal party in the country. Embarking on an Authenticity campaign, Mobutu renamed many Congolese cities to eradicate their colonial legacy and promoted a pro-African cultural attitude. Foreign assets were also nationalised and Mobutu has consolidated his rule to form a highly centralised and tightly regulated government, with him as undisputed dictator. His efforts have come to a conclusion recently, as he has officially declared the renaming of the Republic of the Congo to the Republic of Zaire. Although largely a symbolic move, it represents Mobutu’s complete control over the Congo and his disdain for their colonial legacy, as well as the failure of yet another African democracy."         
 tshombe.1.d:0 "Tshombe’s leadership is now reaching its 7th year and is being met with much celebration in the streets. Already, the Congo has seen a massive influx of investors coming from foreign countries and the Government Bureau of Labor is assuring everyone that the working conditions are the best in the world. Tshombe is also proud to announce that rehabilitation centers are up and running across the country and are dedicated to reforming individuals who oppose the State of the Congo. As seen in these highly photogenic pictures, the people of the State of the Congo are very happy to be under Tshombe’s benevolent rule.\nHowever, not everyone is happy with our glorious leader’s rule and many independent reporters have falsely claimed “human rights abuses” and “oppression”. The Broadcaster Network of the State of the Congo has refuted these claims with evidence that everything is fine and happy here in the Congo. Unfortunately, many of these reporters have committed highly elaborate suicides very quickly after having their preposterous claims refuted."       
 mobutu_execution.1.d:0 "Mobutu, who was captured by Tshombe’s forces, has been sentenced to death after a speedy trial. Mobutu was found guilty of conspiring against the Congolese people, desiring chaos and power above order and harmony, and being completely inept. Tshombe presented many important pieces of evidence such as Mobutu’s failures as Chief of Staff and Mobutu’s attempt to kill off the Congolese government with no plan to replace it. Additionally, Tshombe has presented evidence that will not be public due to its graphical nature. Such evidence exposed Mobutu’s love of hitting children then selling drugs to those same children to ease the pain of him hitting them then hitting them again. Such shocking and cruel behavior is only fit for the worst of punishments. However, in a bout of mercy, Tshombe sentenced Mobutu to a merciful death at the hands of an alligator."
 mobutu.10.d:0 "With control of the country re-established, it appeared that the Congo Crisis was coming to its end. Since his first coup in 1960, Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko had been consolidating his power - assuring the loyalty of local divisions and sending those with questionable loyalty to remote garrison duties. Following Operation Dragon Rogue, Prime Minister Moise Tshombe lost favour with both President Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu, which would cause a major political crisis in the upcoming 1965 elections. Whilst Tshombe achieved a majority, Kasa-Vubu exploited the defection of a large portion of his party to appoint Evariste Kimba - who was anti-Tshombe - to the position of Prime Minister. The parliament was loyal to Tshombe and rejected the President’s move. This prompted a political deadlock which effectively paralysed the Congolese government. On 25th November, Mobutu broke the deadlock by seizing power in a bloodless yet decisive coup d’etat. Mobutu has declared a state of emergency, giving him virtually unlimited power for at least 5 years. He has promised to restore democracy after the limit, however with considerable internal and foreign support and dictatorial authority, it remains uncertain whether he will be willing to give up his power."
