 Albania_1_desc:0 "We have arrested deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Koci Xoxe. Since the rise of Albanian communism, Xoxe has been a vocal opponent of our leader [ALB.GetLeader]. Further, since the despicable [YUG.GetLeader]'s break with [SOV.GetLeader] he has also been fervently supported by the damned Yugoslavs, who likely wish to annex our country into their greater south slavic soviet republic. Now that he is under our control, we must decide what to do with him."
 Albania_2_desc:0 "In a secret trial earlier today, the traitor Koci Xoxe admitted to working for British intelligence and conspiring with [YUG.GetLeader], leader of the backstabbing [YUG.GetNameDef]. His purging has been stated as a result of his \"pro-Yugoslav activities,\" and his punishment for betraying [ALB.GetLeader]'s new state will be to be hanged by the neck until dead."
 Albania_3_desc:0 "\nThe 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been eventful for the communist world due to it being the first Congress since the death of Joseph Stalin. During the conference, [SOV.GetLeader] denounced Stalin's cult of personality and his reign of terror over the east - something the increasingly paranoid Enver Hoxha has seen as a threat to his reign. The ever growing schism between the [SOV.GetNameDef] and the [ALB.GetNameDef] could be a threat to our sovereignty. We can allow it to grow and forge our own path, or we can turn to Liri Belishova for guidance. As a pro-Stalinist and friend of [SOV.GetLeader], she could usher in a new age of prosperity for our nation."
 Albania_10_desc:0 "As Enver Hoxha has grown more and more paranoid, the people and the government have turned against him as he has the new First Secretary of the Soviet Union. In the wake of the denouncement of his style of Stalinist rule, a notable pro-Soviet faction has risen up and usurped Hoxha in the name of the new Albanian First Secretary Liri Belishova. Now that Hoxha is in chains and accused of anti-Communist as well as anti-Albanian activities, we must decide what to do with him."

 Albania_5_desc:0 "With the betrayal of the scheming [YUG.GetLeader], we have been isolated from our Communist brothers, with no direct connections to the east and grand designs put on our humble country from the west. These grand designs include whispers of an invasion of our country, in hopes that our isolated state is weakened and more willing to join their side. We will stand and fight this capitalist subversion of our nation, but we may not win against their trained infiltrators."
 Albania_6_desc:0 "The rumors of a western infiltration were true! Over the past few months, we have faced and repelled several attempts at sowing dissent in [ALB.GetLeader]'s Albania. Trained Albanian expats have been returning to the homeland under cover of night in order to overthrow our people's government in favor of some oppressive regime. Fortunately, our trained Albanian security forces have cornered and taken prisoner all of these foreign dissenters to our regime."
 Albania_7_desc:0 "The rumors of a western infiltration were true! Over the past few months, trained Albanian expats have been returning to the homeland to overthrow Hoxha's oppressive regime in exchange for a western aligned state free from Communist oppression. The NATO aligned freedom fighters have been fighting tooth and nail against the state in a brutal guerilla war that is slowly burning harder and hotter. Under threat of death, Hoxha has fled the country and taken refuge in Moscow, and, in the disarray, a western aligned government has taken hold of our nation."
 Albania_8_desc:0 "Over the past few months, the [ALB.GetName] has been fending off guerilla attacks from tightly organized, well trained Albanian expats. Though the freedom fighters fought fiercely, they have been countered at every turn, likely due in part to a traitor in their midst. All who have opposed Hoxha's new state in this failed revolt have been shot, hanged, or jailed. Although it is widely unspoken as to where the expats were trained, it is almost certain that they were trained by western saboteurs."
 Albania_9_desc:0 "In a slow burn of guerilla warfare and covert operations, small groups of Albanian nationalists have overwhelmed Hoxha's security forces. Following rumors of western infiltration, these nationalist groups began their attacks on the state, fighting tooth and nail for freedom from Hoxha's regime. Under threat of death, Hoxha has fled the country and taken refuge in Moscow, and a western aligned government has taken control and opened diplomatic talks with NATO countries. No word has been heard from [SOV.GetLeader], but he is likely not pleased with this development."
