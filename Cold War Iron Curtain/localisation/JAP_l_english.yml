 KOR_RAID.4.d:0 "A nation in crisis has been developed, as South Korea’s president, Park Chung Hee, was assassinated at the hands of North Korean commandos. The attack, orchestrated by Unit 124, North Korea’s most prized commando unit, successfully raided the Blue House, the presidential residence in South Korea, and eliminated Park without leaving a trace. In his permanent absence, Prime Minister Chung Il-kwon has been sworn in as the 7th president of the Republic of Korea. Observers point out that should South Korea be unable to create a proper response, it will leave itself vulnerable to a potential North Korean invasion."

 royal.2.d:0 "Just this afternoon, a public broadcast in the Tokyo Imperial Palace was held, with the royal family being held by several guards with firearms. At the forefront, centered on the screen, was Yakov Alexandrovich Malik, a middle aged Soviet Ambassador, with pistol in hand. The acts of the Japanese royal family have led to countless deaths during the second great war, for every action, there is a price to pay. Emperor Hirohito, on the counts of conspiracy to seize power, waging wars of aggression, commission of war crimes, and crimes against humanity, i sentence you, and the entire royal family to death, for this state is to be cleansed and start anew. The United states and Commonwealth, including several neutral nations have already condemned the publicly broadcasted execution that included women and children. Stalin and his communists must apologise for this barbarous act, children are innocent and must be protected. said President Truman, during a press conference."
 royal.1.d:0 "Emperor Hirohito has just announced his abdication this morning, as to everyone's shock. Emotions and Opinion mixed from nation to nation, the JCP did not waste time to support the Emperor's decision. The United States President Harry S. Truman, reacted in a press conference by subtly proposing that a third party must have had a hand in this decision. While the United Kingdom stayed surprisingly neutral, and the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China both supporting and criticizing the Emperor's decision respectively. As expected, the USSR strongly supported the abdication, several diplomats commenting that they believe NATO is going to go paranoid over this. Days later, the President of the United states accused the JCP to have been a third party to possibly force the abdication, Allegations were quickly denied by the JCP. The USSR made comments about the americans spreading conspiracy and fear to further de-stabilize the asian regions.."
 royal.3.d:0 "Yesterday, an unscheduled international broadcast over Television and radio surprised everyone, as communist-like music played for a few seconds, to which after, what looked like the Japanese Royal family Emperor Hirohito and his bride, and several other men, women, and even children were lined up on elevated wooden gallows, each with a noose around their necks at the Beijing Imperial Palace, also known as the Forbidden City. A young man wearing a PLA officer uniform stood behind a pedestal, as another officer was prepared to pull a lever. For crimes against mainland China, for crimes against our people, for crimes of giving our prisoners death without honor, for crimes against humanity and the state, we, the communist party of China, by Orders of Chairman Mao Zedong, sentence you and your entire family to hang, until death is confirmed, here at the Forbidden City. Multiple NATO countries were quick to react to this broadcast, strongly condemning the questionable actions of the PRC, some even calling for retaliation. The United States were quick to blame the USSR for helping of the execution, to which the USSR was quick to dismiss the baseless accusations as there were no soviets present, only asians. Mongolia and the Republic of China in particular has closed their borders to the PRC following the traumatic events."
 treaty_san_francisco.1.d:0 "Today the San Francisco Peace Treaty was officially signed by 48 nations between Japan and the Allied Powers. This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined."
 japan.1.d:0 "A tragedy has occurred today. In the Greater Tokyo Area within the town of Yokohama within the Kanagawa Prefecture, an electric train has erupted into flames as it approached a Yokohama station. The wooden electric train is thought to have come into contact with a hanging electric wire opened by train technicians. The doors were unable to be opened by the 150 people within the train, and the windows were too small to fit through. First reports say that almost all of the 150 people on the train have perished. The wooden 63 series train, produced in World War Two, was designed with cost-cutting in mind. However, it seems that cost-cutting has come at the expense of human lives. There are many protests."
 japan.2.d:0 "The Kinkaku-ji Temple in the highlands of Kyoto's northern hills was built in 1398 by a shogun, part of his personal villa. It was built in the Zen style. However, today, the 600 year old temple was burnt down. At 3:17 AM, the regional fire dispatch station sent its trucks to the temple. Local bystanders say that no one was inside, but the priceless Buddhist statues within were completely unrecognizable. A local investigating police team found that an acolyte of the temple went missing. They therefore concluded that the acolyte may have set the fire. At 3:00 PM, the police began a manhunt for the perpetrator."
 japan.3.d:0 "On the west side of Tokyo, 129 people have died due to an engine failure on a Douglas C-124. 122 soldiers and 7 aviators have died in the Globemaster's crash. The two majors in charge of the aircraft were very experienced and the air crash was unexpected. A local USAF Staff Sergeant, Robert D. Vess, helped pull survivors from the wreckage. However, all of the passengers died within minutes of the plane crash at 4:34. At 5:50, the first medics arrived on scene by helicopter to the watermelon field where the plane crashed and confirmed that all were dead. This has set a record for aviation fatality count."
 japan.4.d:0 "A new movie, Gojira, has been released in the Japanese town of Nagoya. Directed by Ishiro Honda, the film shows how "Godzilla" attacks various Japanese towns and then finally is destroyed by the "Oxygen Destroyer" which disintegrates oxygen atoms to cause asphyxiation. The director overtly said the point of the movie is to fight against nuclear testing. Japanese critics have said that the film is implausible and is only exploiting the fame of the Lucky Dragon incident."

 cambodia.2.d:0 "On January 17, 1968, the new communist militant group, the Khmer Rouge, led by the mysterious Pol Pot, launched a nation-wide communist insurgency across Cambodia. Guerrilla fighters, numbering only 4-5,000, have taken quite a portion of the countryside in the northern countryside alone, using the Jungle to their advantage. Already, Vietnam has shown support for the Khmer Rouge, supplying them with arms and training from fellow insurgents. The revolution came about after what can only be speculated to be years of preparation for the insurgency."
 Uganda.1.d:0 "On July 30th, 1953, Secretary of State for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton mentioned in passing the possibility of unification and federation of the British East Africa territories. This passing mention sparked stressed protest from the Ministers of Buganda, stating that they felt the idea of integration would destroy their culture and their way of life. Though Governor of Uganda, Sir Andrew Cohen, assured them that no decision would be made without consulting the Buganda, many political figures feel like the cat is out of the bag, and many more call for Bugandan independence." 
 Uganda.2.d:0 "As the Kebaka Crisis continues to spiral in Uganda, the British Colonial Administration has decided to exile the Bugandan King Mutesa II to silence his calls against the proposed East African Federation. While British authorities had hoped this would calm the situtaiton it is appearing to have the opposite effect. Sir Cohen, the governor of Uganda had wanted a new monarch selected however Buganda is refusing to comply......"
 Uganda.3.d:0 "After being in exile for months, Mutesa II has returned to Uganda following the ratification of the Buganda Agreement amending the prior agreement from 1900.

Over fifty thousand Parisians attended his funeral at Montparnasse Cemetery."
 Uganda.10.d:0 "King Mutesa II of Buganda has fled his home country of Uganda to the United Kingdom following accusations of high treason by Prime Minister Milton Obote. These accusations follow a series of political crises, including the Obote seizing presidential powers of Uganda from Mutesa earlier this week. Mutesa’s objection to this seizure of power resulted in Obote sending troops to the king’s residence on Mengo Hill to bring him the king, dead or alive. Though the king’s bodyguards and the loyalists fought valiantly at the hill and in the streets, they were outgunned by the better armed soldiers. At the end of the battle, the palace was set on fire, with the king narrowly escaping during a sudden thunderstorm."
 Uganda.11.d:0 "Further turmoil in Uganda broke out today as Prime Minister Milton Obote announced a refferendum over the status of two counties and whether or not they should remain part of the Kingdom of Buganda, be returned to the Kingdom of Bunyoro or to establish a new district. The Kingdom of Buganda sees this refferendum as a direct assault on their autonomy. With the King of Buganda being the cermonial President of Uganda more turmoil for this small African nation is likely soon to occur."
 Uganda.12.d:0 "Prime Minister Milton Obote has been executed by King Mutesa II of Bugunda for high treason against the King of Bugunda, following his own accusations that the king himself had committed high treason. These accusations follow a series of political crises, including the Obote seizing presidential powers of Uganda from Mutesa earlier this week. Mutesa’s objection to this seizure of power resulted in Obote sending troops to the king’s residence on Mengo Hill to bring him the king, dead or alive. Though the Obote’s soldiers were much better armed than the king’s bodyguards and the ragtag loyalists fighting street to street, their guerilla tactics and refusal to surrender resulted in a collapse of the rebellious offensive. The disgraceful prime minister was found trying to escape the capital in the trunk of a car, and was immediately brought to see the kings justice for his crimes."
 KPA_RAID.4.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the South Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. This came mere days after the successful assassination of the South Korean leader Park Chung Hee by Unit 124, North Korea’s most prized commando unit. The United States of America, the chief ally of South Korea, has yet to make an official response to the declaration of war, but reports circulate that the US garrison stationed within the Seoul Metropolitan Area have already left the vicinity, preparing to reinforce the DMZ which has already seen significant amounts of skirmishes never before seen since the Korean War. President Chung Il-kwon and his cabinet have already evacuated the area to an undisclosed location, with the residents of Seoul, Incheon, and other major cities within the area evacuating themselves to the southern provinces of the Republic. North Korea’s main allies, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, have also yet to respond, but observers predict that China will most likely respond the most and the fastest, with the Soviet Union intervening as a last resort should it be necessary."
 KPA_RAID_ALT.4.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the North Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. Already, thousands of soldiers from the KPA have been deployed to the DMZ, and sleeper agents of North Korea have been activated, sabotaging South Korea’s ability to mount a proper response. This was a result of a successful assassination attempt against President Park Chung Hee orchestrated by Unit 124, North Korea’s elite commando force. Seeing the inability to protect the DMZ and its surrounding provinces, the US garrison in Seoul have already evacuated and taken up defensive positions in both Busan and Jeju, endangering millions of South Korean citizens in the face of North Korea. While North Korea’s major allies, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, have yet to respond, it is highly predicted that China will mobilize its troops to assist their communist ally to strengthen its influence in Asia, with the Soviets intervening if necessary."
 KPA_RAID.5.d:0 "North Korea has disclosed that their leader, Kim Il-Sung, is dead. This is surprising for the isolated nation, and even more surprising is that the North Korean leader died from gunshot wounds in what they claim is a South Korean assassination. It is believed this assassination is South Korea's retaliation to North Korea's assassination attempt on Park Chung Hee, the South Korean leader. According to South Korean insiders, the Air Force's special forces Unit 684 carried out the attack. Such an attack is unprecedented on the Korean peninsula, and observers predict a major military conflict to break out soon."
 KPA_RAID.2:0 "Disaster and embarrassment has struck South Korea today as both the Korean Central News Agency, the propaganda arm of North Korea, along with insider sources have reported that South Korea has failed to assassinate Kim Il-Sung of North Korea in retaliation for North Korea’s attempts to assassinate President Park Chung Hee of South Korea. The special forces unit assigned to this task, Unit 684 of the ROK Air Force, are now facing criminal charges in North Korea, with some experts stating that it is merely a show trial, and that it will inevitably end with either their execution, or torture for information. In response, the KCNA has declared that North Korea will use all available methods to “destroy America and her South Korean puppet state, and liberate the Korean people from their yolk”. Mere hours after the report, the American garrison in Seoul is put on high alert, with Washington considering increasing the garrison force substantially in the face of a potential large scale military conflict in the Peninsula."

While many did not agree with his support of the British in the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, his death has sent shockwaves across the Iranian government and population. Many quickly turn the blame to Fada'iyan-e Islam, who have long protested against Hazhir and the high positions he found himself in. His assassin, Seyyed Hossein Emami Esfahani was found to be part of the organization soon after capture. Unrest has sprung up across Tehran, with fundamentalists and those who oppose them taking to the streets in conflict. This may be the start of a greater crisis..."
 iran_political.100.d:0 "Long an advocate for Islamic rule in Iran, Navvab Safavi formed Fada'iyan-e Islam to push for increased fundamentalist reforms into the nation. The government in power would finally have enough of his antics after an attempted assassination on Prime Minister General Fazlollah Zahedi. Safavi was executed by state authorities along with three other allies.\nThe execution marks a dark day for Islamic fundamentalists in Iran, as it becomes clear that secular policies are to stay in Iran."
 iran_political.1301.d:0 "Following the failure of Operation Ajax, tension between the Mosaddegh Regime and the Tudeh flared. Fierce Tudeh resistance during Ajax inspired many into the party, swelling their ranks to the point of majority in the nation. Fearing another coup, Mosaddegh would attempt a crackdown on the party. Armed police would attempt to arrest prominent high ranking forces within the Tudehs, including members of the Fifty-Three. Only rallying up the party, Tehran would be swarmed by armed civilians and paramilitary forces. Within two days, Mosaddegh would resign from his position and flee to Turkey. With former leadership gone and Tehran taken, the Socialist Republic of Iran has been declared. Without internal opposition, the move has solidified the power of the Tudeh party.\nIranians across the nation celebrate the victory, with widespread festivals held in support of the move. Islamic Fundamentalists continue to oppose the Tudeh, but lack cohesion or popular support to truly challenge the new regime. For the West, what started as plans to save oil profits have led to a communist Iran in its place."
 iran_political.1298.d:0 "The formerly iconic monarch of Iran who was once greeted with cheers as he moved across the streets of Tehran was now taunted by crowds, rotten fruit barraging the protected convoy he was in. The convoy quickly moved, heading towards the Tehran Supreme Court. Joining Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is his family, Shaban Jafari, Fazlollah Zahedi, and Nematollah Nassiri, all on trial for high treason. Outside the high court, hundreds of Tudeh protests call for the death penalty for all involved. How will the court decide the fates of the now traitors?"
 iran_political.1300.d:0 "The tense court hearing of the Tehran Supreme Court was finally decided. Those involved in the coup have been sentenced to death. Outside the courthouse, Tudeh supporters celebrate the announcement calling it a major step towards the end of bourgeoise rule in Iran. Quickly after the announcement, the conspirators were brought 15 miles outside of Tehran and executed by firing squad. Over 280 Conspirators were executed, including the entirety of the Pahlavi Dynasty.\nThe end of an era has hit Iran, as thousands of years of monarchist influence comes to an end. This event will send shockwaves across the future of Iran for generations."
 tudeh.1.d:0 "The Supreme Court of Tehran would come to a decision. Within 48 hours, the Pahlavis and numerous of their accomplices are to be exiled from the country never to return. As Mohammad Reza left the courtroom, aggressive protesters would slam rocks at him and his family. This would be his last memory of Iran, as he quickly was revoked of his citizenship and deported to Saudi Arabia, where he would move to the United States. The former monarch has denied any media interviews and has asked that people respect he and his families’ privacy.\nThe end of an era has hit Iran, as thousands of years of monarchist influence comes to an end. This event will send shockwaves across the future of Iran for generations."
 AJAX.105.d:0 "Quickly following the failure of Operation Ajax, the remaining mess would see to be solved. The Tudehs would grow in strength due to their impressive efforts in putting down the coup, which would create friction between the Mosaddegh Regime and the communists almost instantly after the ordeal. Instead of dealing with the situation with more conflict, both sides would quickly see the importance of discussion and an official meeting between leaders of both factions would quickly emerge. While having differences in opinions on numerous subjects, both have shown the power they have working together. With this, settlements have been made to keep peace.\nThe Republic of Iran under Mosaddegh remains in power, even with the force of internal forces around it. The fledgling democracy has faced its greatest threat yet, resisting the West and winning."
 AJAX.101.d:0 "The nationalization of the oil in Iran by the Mosaddegh Regime left the United Kingdom and the United States bitter. Determined to bring back their influence over Iran, the CIA began contact with the Shah, gang leaders, and high ranking military officials to orchestrate a coup. The plan would go array as Mosaddegh heard reports of the coup underway, arresting ringleader Shaban Jafari before the plan could be commenced. With leaked information from the Tudehs and Jafari, Iranian Police would arrest the Pahlavi Royal Family right before they left for their “vacation” in Iran’s Northern mountains. Without strong leadership from Pahlavi and Jafari, Tudeh and Government forces would easily end any attempts of a coup. Hundreds of suspected orchestrators and foreign agents have been arrested.\nWhat now will happen to Iran is a mystery. Monarchist and Western Influence has been eliminated but the question of how the Mosaddegh Regime and Tudeh Party will respond to the coup may determine the fate of the nation. Is a new power struggle brewing already?"
 iran_political.1100.d:0 "After months of contemplation, Mohammad Reza Shah would announce his divorce with Queen Soraya due to her infertility to produce an heir. His only child would marry Ardeshir Zahedi, an enemy of the royal family. With this, he denounced both his wife and daughter and remarried to Farah Pahlavi. Many have seen the entire ordeal as corrupt and morally wrong, others seeing it as excusable due to the need for an heir. Either way, the Royal divorce has sparked up further controversy in Iran" 
 phi_events.1.d:0 "Terrible news has struck today in Manila, when former Philippine Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., was assassinated in the tarmac of the Manila International Airport. A staunch critic of President Ferdinand Marcos, Senator Aquino recently arrived in Manila from his self-imposed exile from the United States, escaping the perils and what would be extreme torture and potential death. Upon arriving in Manila, government soldiers were waiting for his arrival, arresting him in the process. However, upon leaving his plane, gunshots were reported and Ninoy Aquino was found dead lying down in the tarmac. Investigation concluded that a communist hitman named Rolando Galman assassinated Aquino, but reports circulate that Galman was merely a scapegoat, and that the assassination was ordered by the Marcos administration. Nevertheless, thousands of Filipinos were mourning Ninoy Aquino’s death, and the calls for the resignation of the Marcos regime are louder. Observers point out that this event may be a catalyst of what would be a revolution and overthrow of the Marcos regime, but it is too early to speculate."
 dmz_conflict.100.d:0 "Ever since the signing of the armistice agreement, North and South Korea are supposedly enjoying a period of peace, free from conflict that would’ve otherwise spilled more blood in a region filled with death and destruction since the start of the 20th Century. However, this is far from the truth. Ever since the armistice agreement, occasional border skirmishes run rampant throughout the DMZ, where soldiers of the KPA and the ROK Army, along with the US garrison stationed there, are often attacking each other, with inconclusive results. This indirectly shows the flaws of the armistice agreement, in that it merely creates a temporary and symbolic peace in the Korean Peninsula."
 dmz_conflict.101.d:0 "It has been more than 4 years since the border skirmishes and occasional incursions had started in the Korean Peninsula, with both parties attempting to gain territory and push their borders past the DMZ to gain a strategic advantage against the opposing party. Due to the unsuccessful attacks and counter attacks done by both Koreas, observers deduce that the DMZ conflict has effectively ended with an inconclusive result, as both parties still have their borders by the 38th parallel. While this is a result that neither parties would want to accept, the decrease in frequency of border skirmishes have proven that both parties have withdrawn and lost interest in continuing the conflict, and focus on their internal issues that plagues their respective nations, effectively bringing temporary peace in the peninsula once more."
 dmz_conflict.102.d:0 "It has been more than 4 years since the border skirmishes and occasional incursions had started in the Korean Peninsula, with both parties attempting to gain territory and push their borders past the DMZ to gain a strategic advantage against the opposing party. Due to the North’s extensive use of guerilla warfare and its proven success against the US backed South Korea, North Korea has undoubtedly won the DMZ conflict, with observers agreeing with such statement. However, the same observers call such victory as unprecedented, and believe that North Korea may try its luck and potentially bring about full scale military conflict against South Korea."
 dmz_conflict.103.d:0 "War has come once more to the Korean Peninsula, with the North Korean government formally announcing a cessation of the armistice agreement, an informal declaration of war. Already, thousands of soldiers from the KPA have been deployed to the DMZ, and sleeper agents of North Korea have been activated, sabotaging South Korea’s ability to mount a proper response. This was a result of successful incursions by North Korea into their southern neighbor’s territory, reaching as far as the city limits of Seoul. Seeing the inability to protect the DMZ and its surrounding provinces, the US garrison in Seoul have already evacuated and taken up defensive positions in both Busan and Jeju, endangering millions of South Korean citizens in the face of North Korea.

 japan.5.d:0 "After its construction was finished in 1958, Tokyo Tower instantly became landmark of the city. On 14 October 1958, measuring 333 meters high the radio tower became the tallest freestanding tower in the world. Its history begins in mid 1950's when Tachū Naitō was chosen to design a monument that would symbolize Japanese ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse. Naito decided to look for western inspiration which he found in Paris' Eiffel Tower. Many already anticipate Tokyo Tower becoming one of the most visited tourist attractions in Japan."
 hi_japan.1.d:0 "Ever since the Japanese defeat at the end of the Second World War, the country has been under American military occupation and allowed no armed forces. However, with the rising tensions of the Cold War the American government has taken increasing steps towards developing Japan as a Capitalist ally in the East. With American forces facing engagements in the Korean War, Japan’s incredibly exposed and vulnerable position has not gone unnoticed. Leftist and Communist-aligned strikes and demonstrations have also inflamed the situation and the United States clearly now sees it prudent to allow Japan to form its own military again. The Japanese government has now officially authorised the creation of a national military, however its role is to be limited specifically to self defence and will be tightly monitored by the US, still wary from the World War merely a decade prior. No matter the restrictions, the creation of the Japanese military helps reinforce the precarious Allied position in Asia, whilst highlighting Japan’s new found national sovereignty."

The police then attacked the demonstrators, causing a bloody engagement with the unarmed protesters. Even worse, the first case of police using lethal weapons against demonstrators since the end of the war has prompted a major backlash and much pressure has been put on the existing police procedures concerning the management of demonstrations."

 KISHI_DESC:0 "During the 1920s and early 1930s, the brilliant young bureaucrat Nobusuke Kishi travelled to the leading industrial powers of the world and studied their economic policies. Upon his return he became a believer in state-guided economic growth. By the mid-1930s the Japanese Army handed Manchukuo’s economic policy entirely in Kishi’s hands. He oversaw economic growth but was involved in corruption and labor exploitation before his return to Japan in 1940. During the war he served several cabinets, mostly as the Munitions Minister. When the war ended he was detained but avoided criminal charges despite his deep involvement with the brutal exploitation of non-Japanese labor. He found the American trials to be illegitimate and sought to organize conservative supporters in Japan to assert the country’s independence. Although a member of the ruling Liberal Party, he actively criticizes and undermines Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida for his over-reliance on the United States. However, at the moment Kishi has avoided being purged by the Americans because of his ability to organize conservative factions in the Liberal Party against the Japanese socialists."
 YOSHIDA_DESC:0 "When the Liberal Party won the 1946 general elections, the Allied authorities quickly barred the party leader, Ichiro Hatoyama from becoming Prime Minister. In his stead Shigeru Yoshida took over the premiership. Shigeru Yoshida joined the foreign service in 1906 and during World War II he actively sought to push Japan to pursue peace with the Allied powers. The career diplomat long had pro-American and pro-British leanings, making him an ideal Prime Minister for the occupying authorities. Since becoming Prime Minister, Yoshida has focused on economics, seeking to rebuild the Japanese economy. In terms of foreign policy, Yoshida has worked to establish a security partnership with the United States. Many suggest this policy prioritizing the economy and differing defense to the Americans as a Yoshida doctrine. Yoshida must keep a lid on the remnants of nationalist factions in Japan and demonstrate to the wider population that his policies will lead to prosperity and security for Japan or risk being labeled an American stooge."
