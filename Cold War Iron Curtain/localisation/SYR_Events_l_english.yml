Sami al-Hinnawi declared himself the new President, but barely four weeks in, he was deposed by Adib Shishakli.

 syr_news.6.d:0 "On the night of 8th March, military units loyal to the Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party moved to Damascus after a year of planning and blessing of party leader Michel Aflaq. The plotters have taken the apparatus of state with minimal violence by the morning, and the Syrian people acted indifferently. The new rulers of Syria established the National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), composed of twelve Ba'athists, eight Nasserists and independents as the ruling body. The Nasserists have spoke of another attempt at unification with Egypt, though the Ba’athists are less enthusiastic of the idea."

 syr_news.7.d:0 "Internal conflicts brewed in the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party since 1963. The leaders and the old guard of the party wished to rule Syria under ‘classical’ Ba’athism, but the younger and radical members saw a Syria better in the form of ‘Neo-Ba’athism’ under Marxist-Leninist principles. On the 21st of February, violence erupted between Ba’ath party members in major cities and as the dust settled the Neo-Ba’athists have won the struggle. The Ba’ath party founders have fled the country to Iraq, and have caused a schism between Ba’athists of Iraq and Syria."

Before attending the General National Congress, he ordered his loyalists to surround and arrest Jadid and his supporters. During the Congress, Jadid criticized Assad and stripped his power while the majority of the delegates present knew that they have lost. Once the meeting was over, Jadid and the delegates were arrested by Syrian soldiers loyal to Assad with no casualties. Assad declared victory and the start of the ‘Corrective movement’ to undo Jadid’s wrongs in the country."
