 MOR_SETUP.1.d:0 "Morocco is at a crossroads and tensions are rising. The country is divided with France and Spain both occupying colonial possessions. Sultan Muhammad V took the throne in 1927 and so far has managed the competing influences of France and Spain to preserve his power and assert legitimacy with the people. Urban Moroccans are increasingly drawn to Arab nationalist ideas and the desire for armed struggle against the colonial occupiers of Morocco. To combat this new challenge, the Sultan recently called for the independence and restoration of sovereignty across Morocco. Now he must deal with French and Spanish influence along with balancing his relationship with his traditional base of supporters and the urban anti-colonial Arab nationalists. Only years earlier, Moroccans had volunteered in great numbers to become among the most effective French troops in World War II and the Spanish Civil War."
 MOR_Assasin.1.d:0 "The prominent leader of the Moroccan Army of Liberation, Abbas Messaadi, was shot and killed in Fes. The Moroccan Army of Liberation is a loose organization of rural anti-colonial fighters committed to fighting until all of the Maghreb is liberated. The assassination has caused immediate outrage among anti-colonial activists and Arab nationalists. Abbas Messaadi is already being proclaimed a martyr for the cause. The Sultan is in a difficult position as the assassin or assassins were not captured and no group has claimed responsibility. If an arrest is not made soon, the security situation in the country could rapidly deteriorate."
 MOR_Assasin.2.d:0 "The Moroccan government announced the arrest of Karim Hajjaj, a member of the Istiqlal  Party. He is said to have carried out the recent assassination of Abbas Messaadi, a prominent leader of the Moroccan Army of Liberation. Messaadi was a vocal critic of the Istiqlal  and many of his supporters almost immediately felt the party was responsible. The Sultan largely agreed with the arrest to quickly reduce the tension and weaken a party which has become increasingly critical of his reign. Karim Hajjaj is accused of pulling the trigger under the orders of prominent Istiqlal  Party leader Mehdi Ben Barka. Hajjaj is expected to be swiftly tried and convicted for his role. The Istiqlal  Party has tried to distance itself from the shooter and the plot but are facing public backlash."
 MOR_Assasin.3.d:0 "Sultan Muhammad V recently pardoned Karim Hajjaj, who was convicted for assassinating prominent Morocco Army of Liberation leader Abbas Messaadi. The Sultan made this decision after receiving information that Messaadi had actually been killed by a local gang in Taza hired to carry out the killing. The assassination initially sparked bitter anger and unrest that was quelled following the arrest of Hajjaj, a member of the Istiqlal  Party. The Istiqlal  Party suffered backlash for its alleged role in the plot but it is now up in the air. The government did not say who ordered the assassination nor did they absolve Mehdi Ben Barka, who was accused of initially masterminding the plot with Hajjaj."
 MOR_ISR.1.d:0 "The government of Morocco has secretly communicated an offer for the Moroccan Jewish community. They stated a willingness to lift its policy of keeping its Jewish population in Morocco and allowing them the freedom to emigrate to Israel. They stated this would be possible if we pay a price for each and every Moroccan Jew who chooses to emigrate. The price is certainly high, but considering the riots and threat our people face in Morocco, this may be the only way to ensure their freedom. This is an opportunity and a clear reversal of Moroccan policy and we should really consider this opportunity, despite the costs."
 SPANISH_MOR.1.d:0 "Spain and Morocco have engaged in negotiations over the future of the Rif. These negotiations opened up after Morocco formally gained its independence from France. The Spanish recognized they faced the prospect of prolonged resistance now openly supported by the neighboring state. The Moroccans are demanding Spain vacate the territory it has controlled for years out of consideration for the feelings of the people in the Rif and Morocco. Spain must decide if it will sign an agreement to hand over the territory, or hold on to it."
 SPANISH_MOR.3.d:0 "The people of Morocco are rejoicing over the news that Spain will restore our lands and end their protectorate. The agreement demonstrates the independence and strength of our people and government. Some of the more hawkish elements advocated armed struggle against Spain and questioned our decision to hold talks. With the agreement, we are vindicated and will have more authority and influence over those more violent factions. The Spanish would not budge on the cities of Cueta and Mellila, but we will have to leave it for now. Spain has already conceded much to us. It is a new era for a free Morocco."
 SPANISH_MOR.5.d:0 "Tension is thick across the nation as news reached about the failed talks with Spain. Many Moroccans view it as a grave insult and believe Spain has shown their total inability to comprehend the new reality in the world. Those who have long advocated armed resistance will greatly benefit; already there are reports of young Moroccans joining militias and clamoring for an opportunity to fight Spain. The humiliated government, which promised a breakthrough in the talks, must act quickly to control the emotions of the people and prepare a response. Clearly Spain has no interest in a just resolution to the crisis."

 MOR_POL.1.d:0 "The Councile of the Throne, a body established by the French it advise the sultan, was embroiled in controversy recently. Although officially an advisory body, many nationalists accuse the council of being a tool of the French Resident to enforce its will on the sultan. These accusations appeared to have been confirmed during a recent council meeting when the outspoken nationalist Mohammad Laghzaoui was expelled at the alleged urging of the French Resident. This caused an uproar and led to other nationalist members leaving as well, with the sultan meeting with them immediately after in a private audience. The event has galvanized nationalists and strengthened rumors the sultan is sympathetic to their cause. Traditional Moroccan loyalists are said to be angered by the actions of the Sultan, accusing him of violating established protocols to engage with nationalists."
 MOR_POL.2.d:0 "A nationalist protest in Aghmat was brutally suppressed by police operating under the orders of the local Qaid in the area. The Sultan, upon hearing of these actions, demanded the Quaid appear before him and explain his actions. Thami El Glaoui, a prominent Pasha accused of pro-French sympathies was supposed to appear for the Qaid. However, the Pasha did not appear due to being abroad and the summons were ignored. Although the El Glauoi family insists this failure to appear was a case of simple miscommunication, the Sultan is said to be very upset by these events. It appears he know looks at Thami El Glaoui with much more suspicion and distrust."
 MOR_POL.5.d:0 "The Feast of Mouloud is an annual event where all the Pashas and Qadis come to renew their loyalty to the Sultan. The Pashas and Qadis do these pledges in a private audience with the Sultan while their tribes make a public demonstration of loyalty. This is a major event that publicly solidifies the traditional base of support for the monarchy. The recent rise of nationalism and anti-colonialism has put these relationships to the test. Many of these Pashas are thought to be pro-French to have benefitted greatly from the French colonial regime. The ceremony this year is considered very important both for the Pashas and the Sultan."
 Throne_Crisis.1.d:0 "The Feast of Mouloud continued as it traditionally went, but a major incident occurred during the private audience between the Sultan and his Pasha Thami El Glaoui. The elderly but powerful Pasha began by criticizing nationalists for encouraging disorder in the country. The Sultan stated the nationalists are loyal Moroccan subjects. This provoked a angry lecture by the old Pasha which left the Sultan speechless. Thalmi soon left the stunned Sultan. The Sultan then informed his Grand Vizier to bar Thalmi from returning to the court due to his comments and blatant disrespect. Later, two Qadis, who were the sons of Thalmi, had their audience with the Sultan. They sought to reduce tensions by claiming their father was just admonishing the Sultan as a father does to his son. However, this only angered the Sultan more and was another insult."
 Throne_Crisis.2.d:0 "The traditional Feast of Mouloud event has been marred by controversy following the decision by the Sultan to expel Thami El Glaoui and his family from court. The decision followed private audiences between the Sultan, Thami, and then later with his sons. The Sultan felt insulted by an aggressive tirade by Thami against Moroccan nationalists. When Thami was informed of his expulsion, he immediately departed with his family and tribe. They left before the end of the Feast of Mouloud which ends with a public declaration of loyalty by the tribes. The Sultan and his palace view this abrupt exit as evidence that Thalmi is committing an open mutiny against the royal family." 
 MOR_POL.11.d:0 "Following talks in Aix Les Bains, a Regency Council has been established for Morocco. This body will play a major role in helping administrate the country and negotiate for independence while the Mohammad V remains in exile. The nationalists long called for the return of exiled Sultan Mohammad the V while France refused to return him. The Regency Council is a compromise to allow both sides to maintain their position but move forward on independence negotiations. Members of the council must be approved by the exiled Sultan, giving him the ability to keep his supporters in the negotiations."
 FRANCAFRIQUE_MOR.1.d:0 "Sultan Arafa, who took over the throne following the exile of his cousin Sultan Mohammad V has called on France to intervene and save his throne. Upon taking power, Arafa has faced heavy opposition from nationalists and also some traditional Pashas who view his appointment as illegal and part of a French plot. Citizens across Morocco call Arafa the French Sultan. The French government announced it would back Sultan Arafa out of its duty to the Moroccan people and to establish law and order across the protectorate. Armed militias and loyalist to Mohammad V are already organizing and grabbing portions of the country for the exiled Sultan. Many observers believe the French intervention will make a civil war in Morocco inevitable."
 MOR_CONSPIRACY.1.d:0 "The French Resident in Morocco, who oversees the monarchy and promotes French interests is closely involved in a plot to find an alternative Sultan for Morocco. The current ruler, Sultan Mohammad V has increasingly associated himself with nationalists and continues to make statements condemning foreign influence in Morocco, though not directly naming France or Spain. Of more concern is rumors that the Sultan is directing his government to openly aid and even train anti-colonial fighters across the country. The Resident and other French agents identified the first cousin of the Sultan, Mohammad ben Arafa as willing to take the throne if it becomes vacant. He also promised to support French interests and clampdown on nationalists. French agents are meeting with prominent Pashas to gauge their support for putting a new Sultan to the throne. The Pashas have traditionally been close supporters of the French."
 Arafa.1.d:0 "Mohammad ben Arafa, the newly declared Sultan of Morocco, strengthened his claims to the throne following a ceremony in which the leading Pashas and nobility of Morocco declared him the Imam. This symbolically shows Arafa has retained the traditional base of Moroccan royal power. However, some Pashas refused to attend and many Moroccans are said to be infuriated with the exile of former Sultan Mohammad V. Arab nationalists in particular are leading the public outrage over the new Sultan who is being called the French Sultan. Whether Arafa can calm the growing outrage is unknown. Many observers note that modern Moroccan society may not be as compliant or obedient to the traditional elites as in the past."
 MOR_EXILE.1.d:0 "During the traditional Eid celebration, French authorities confronted Mohammad V and arrested the Sultan of Morocco. The Sultan is accused of actively conspiring with nationalists and using state institutions to provide weapons, supplies, and training to anti-colonial fighters in Morocco. The French have quickly taken the Sultan and his family to Corsica and it is rumored that Mohammad Ben Arafa, first cousin to the Sultan, will take his place. The reaction of Moroccans, especially nationalists is expected to be immediate; however, the French believe the new Sultan will quickly establish legitimacy and rally the traditional Pashas to solidify his control over the country."
 SPR_MOR_ALT.1.d:0 "Sultan Arafa has strengthened his legitimacy among the Moroccan people and enjoys the favor of France following his recent victory in the civil war. With this backing he recently directed his government to formally request the return of colonial territory currently held by Spain. This may be the best opportunity domestically to press the claims. A successful negotiation with Spain would strengthen his image among the people and undermine propaganda from the opposition that Sultan Arafa is a colonial puppet. The government is confident Spain will agree."
 SPR_MOR_ALT.2.d:0 "The Moroccan Sultan Arafra sent a high level delegation to request we handover our territorial possessions in Morocco to the new government. This would effectively end our protectorate over Morocco as well. If we agree to the request, we would improve our image across the Arab World and other post-colonial states. It would also improve relations with France who back the regime of Sultan Arafa. More importantly, these lands are already expensive to maintain and any future armed rebellion from Moroccans would hurt our international image and economy. However, these lands have been Spanish for decades and provided decisive support during the Civil War. Certainly, there are many nationalists in those territories who would no doubt consider armed resistance if we decline, but we also have loyalists who would come to support the Spanish cause. A decision must be made."
 SPR_MOR_ALT.3.d:0 "The Spanish government reacted negatively to the legitimate request of our government for the return of occupied Moroccan land. They continue to hold our people as colonized subjects and their refusal has caused protests to breakout across the country. Sultan Arafa is said to be stunned by this decision, he felt the Spanish would not risk a colonial war or even possible French intervention by refusing. In an address to the nation, Sultan Arafa condemned the Spanish action and called for the Moroccan people to mobilize for the future liberation of all Moroccans. Armed groups of anti-colonial activists are already preparing for an intervention and the Sultan ordered his military to provide them with training and arms as continued Spanish imperialism will not be tolerated."
 SPR_MOR_ALT.4.d:0 "The Spanish government positively reacted to our legitimate request for the return of occupied Moroccan land and people. We have agreed to their proposed timetable of withdrawal in the coming weeks in order to ensure not just a smooth transfer of authority but an honorable withdrawal for the Spanish state. Sultan Arafa announced the joyous news to nation, with many taking to the streets to express their joy over the unification of their country. The successful liberation of Spanish occupied Morocco provides great legitimacy to Sultan Arafa and his political opponents worry if they can ever remove a man they consider to be a tool of French imperialism."
 MOR_CIVIL_WAR.20.d:0 "The French and their Moroccan allies exiled Sultan Mohammad V and installed his cousin, Arafa. They are now calling on us to recognize Sultan Arafa as the new ruler. The French miscalculated as their blatant intervention has caused massive unrest across Morocco and civil war appears inevitable as Moroccan Republicans form armed bands against Arafa and the French. We have several options on how to deal with the situation. We can decline to recognize Sultan Arafa at this time. Doing so would only risk attacks and an uprising within our own Moroccan territory. It would also allow us to see how the civil war plays out without committing to one camp. The other option is to openly condemn the legitimacy of Arafa and provide recognition, along with arms to the Moroccan Republicans who oppose him. This would improve our image among Moroccans and set us up as the dominant European influence in Morocco." 
 MOR_POL.25.d:"Morocco has been plunged into political turmoil following the resignation of Prime Minister Mbarek Bekkay. The first Prime Minister was forced to resign by the nationalist Istiqlal Party after he sought royal support to legitimize a coalition of suppressed, pro-monarchy parties who formed the Popular Movement party. This action by the Prime Minister alienated pro-resistance, nationalist leaders who have blamed Bekkay for moving too slowly on pressuring the withdrawal of all French forces from the country. Ahmed Balafrej, Secretary General of the Istiqlal, is expected to take over the premiership but observers fear his neutralist stance may only exacerbate political tensions. Already there are reports of pro-resistance Istiqlal party members forming an opposition faction within the party. Where resistance groups could blame Bekkay before, it appears Istiqlal will now be open to public anger of nationalist Moroccan activists."
 MOR_POL.10.d:0 "The Moroccan government announced the legalization of the political party known as the National Union of Popular Forces (NUPF). The NUPF emerged as a socialist offshoot of the Istiqlal Party and for a long time was deemed a threat to the government. Despite an aggressive crackdown by the Interior Ministry, the NUPF continued to grow and flourish. Legalizing the group will hopefully push it towards the mainstream and away from more radical positions like armed resistance. The NUPF itself has different elements and the government believes its actions will strengthen the moderate parts of the party. The media is praising the government for its maturity in dealing with political opposition."

 SPANISH_MOR.2.d:0 "The Spanish and Moroccan states announced an agreement for the retrocession of the Rif to Morocco. Spain also formally announced an end to its protectorate over Morocco. The agreement is a major boost for the Moroccan government who have regained territory which had been under Spanish occupation for decades and has gained greater legitimacy both domestically and internationally. Observers note Spain likely did not want to provoke a colonial war in the region and wanted to maintain cordial ties with Morocco as it asserts its independence. Spain retains control of the two cities Cueta and Mellila, noting they are an integral part of Spain and have been part of the nation for centuries. The Moroccan government also claims these cities but agreed to leave the matter for now."
 SPANISH_MOR.4.d:0 "Talks between Span and Morocco broke down with no agreement on the continued occupation of the Rif by Spain. In addition, Spain did not renounce their protectorate over Morocco as well. The failure to reach an agreement is a major blow to the Moroccan government and the more moderate anti-colonial activists. They had argued armed struggle could not ensure success, but negotiations were necessary for the final breakthrough. The Spanish government insists it will not compromise the rights of its citizens or its historical position in the region just to make Morocco happy. The Moroccan government so far has remained largely quiet with only a brief comment expressing distress over the failed efforts."
 MOR_POL.3.d:0 "The Moroccan government has called on extensive foreign aid to support its people. The government notes years of foreign exploitation and recent conflicts have put immense strains on the Moroccan state and its ability to support the people. All nations are being asked to provide whatever help they can in helping Morocco achieve not just independence for all its people but also stable growth for long-term prosperity. Several embassies released statements saying they would advocate for the Moroccan people and the unique circumstances they face."
 SLA.1.d:0 "The Moroccan Sultan recently directed Liberation Army forces fighting Spanish colonialism to be established as the Saharan Liberation Army. The group of guerilla fighters is not officially affiliated with the Moroccan Army, but many observers believe the core fighters are Moroccan Army troops. These men are supported by local Moroccan liberation fighters and other volunteers who crossed the border into Spanish occupied territory. The establishment of the Saharan Liberation Army indicates a serious escalation and renewed focus by the Moroccan government and anti-colonial activists to expand armed struggle in Spain."
 IFNI_WAR_FRANCE.1.d:0 "Reports from the Western Sahara indicate that Moroccan forces are pushing on from the Spanish controlled territories into Mauritania. This suggests a major deterioration of the Spanish and French position in the area. The Moroccan government released a statement saying the liberation and unification of the Maghreb is at hand and no foreign power should seek to prevent the unification. A high-level emergency meeting between French and Spanish leaders is expected to occur shortly as both remain quiet on how bad the situation is for them in the region currently."
 FRANCAFRIQUE_MOR.10.d:0 "The Moroccan Civil War has broken out between supporters of the French-backed Sultan Arafa and Moroccan Republicans who accuse the French of installing Arafa to the throne. Several other factions are also involved in the fighting, including those who support the deposed Sultan Mohammad V and powerful, rural Moroccan leaders who oppose the increased political influence of urban Moroccans. Those who support the republican cause believe the monarchy is clearly a tool for foreign imperialism and Morocco can only be free without a monarchy. The regime of Sultan Arafa can draw on French support and the loyalty of those monarchists not supporting the cause for the restoration of Sultan Mohammad V."
 MOR_CIVIL_WAR.10.d:0 "The people of Morocco were left in shock following news that Mohammad V had been assassinated. The details of what transpired are currently unknown but cities across Morocco saw thousands take to the streets to mourn. As Sultan, Mohammad V, in recent years, had taken a much stronger stance on the question of Moroccan independence. He openly courted nationalists and empowered urban activists, drawing the ire of traditional rural elites and France. Already many in the country are blaming the assassination on France or French-directed proxies. As these rumors spread, it appears unlikely that the death of Mohammad V will make life easier for the French-backed Sultan Arafa."
 MOR_CIVIL_WAR.21.d:0 "Urban Moroccans in recent years have emerged as a major political force in modern Morocco. The spread of anti-colonial rhetoric and Arab nationalism has inspired thousands of young Moroccans, especially those enrolled in schools. This, combined with their vital economic role, makes them a more potent force than the traditional, rural Moroccan elites. The blatant installation of Sultan Arafa to the throne by France has proven to be a step too far. Now thousands of urban Moroccans are not just protesting the puppet monarch but have launched uprisings across cities. They claim the armed uprisings will continue until the corrupt monarchy and France are removed from Morocco. Many Moroccans are attracted to the clear anti-colonial message of the Republicans and their promise for greater political freedoms once they win." 
 MOR_CIVIL_WAR.22.d:0 "The Moroccan Civil War took a dramatic turn following reports that Spain will intervene by providing extensive support for the Republican forces in Morocco. The Spanish claim their action is meant to support the people of Morocco and end arcane and oppressive tactics orchestrated by France. The French are said to be furious over the news, while many observers note Spain is acting in a way to ensure a strong relationship with the Moroccan government if the republicans win. More importantly, the Spanish intervention will strengthen Spain's with other Arab states and quell any potential Moroccan unrest within its own territory. The republican leadership released a statement thanking Spain for its contributions to Moroccan freedom."
 TANGIERS_PROTOCOL.1.d:0 "Morocco and Spain recently signed the Tangiers Protocol to resolve the status of the city. Although Tangiers was nominally under the Moroccan monarchy, it has spent several decades as an international city under Spanish protection. This new agreement formally restores full sovereignty of Tangiers to Morocco. News of the agreement saw many Moroccans celebrate the return of a city long seen as occupied, as they had previously condemned how the city emerged as a party destination for European elites who used up Moroccan resources but gave their money to the foreign occupiers of the city. Morocco hopes it will not only restore its sovereignty but ensure the profits made by the city can reach the people of Morocco."
 TANGIERS_PROTOCOL.2.d:0 "Spain announced it was formally annexing Tangiers following a referendum held to determine its final status. The decision has being condemned by Morocco and other international states. Spain claimed the referendum represented the people of Tangiers expressing their right to self-determination. The Moroccan government accused Spain of manipulating the vote by excluding many Moroccans while counting foreign voters and launching a campaign that wrongly indicated Moroccan rule would see an economic collapse for the city. Spain has brushed off these criticisms and plans on holding a large festival to celebrate the annexation and unification of Tangiers with Spain. The Moroccan government is rumored to be preparing alternative methods, including armed resistance." 
 MOR_UN.1.d:0 "Morocco was formally admitted to the United Nations following a vote. Upon formally gaining sovereignty, seeking membership to the United Nations was the first decision ordered by the government. Morocco was admitted with an overwhelming majority and many nations, especially from the Arab World, warmly welcomed Morocco. Considering the long struggle Morocco endured to achieve independence and its engagement with the Arab World and North Africa, the new member is expected to be an active supporter for anti-colonial and pro-Arab votes in the General Assembly."
 MOR_Coronation.2.d:0 "Sultan Mohammad V has returned to the throne following his brief exile and has re-coronated himself as Sultan. This marks the end of an epic struggle for the Sultan who endured months of exile abroad after the French deposed him in favor of is cousin. However, popular agitation and unrest forced the French to back down and their puppet ruler soon gave the throne back to Mohammad V. The Sultan thanked the people for their support and perseverance through trying times. He promised his commitment to the Moroccan nation and people, not to any foreign ruler."
 MOR_EXILE.2.d:0 "The French recently forced Mohammad V to resign his throne and then installed his cousin Arafa as the new Sultan of Morocco. Fearing Moroccans would rally to Mohammad V, the French quickly ordered the former Sultan to get his family and leave the country. Within hours the French had the former Sultan and his family on a plane to Corsica in exile. Hopes that the lightning-quick change of leadership and exile would stun any potential unrest proved misguided as urban Moroccans almost immediately began agitating against French interference when news spread the next morning. Muhammad V managed to release his own message to the people claiming he had not resigned but was forcibly removed by the French."
 MOR_EXILE.3.d:0 "In a private ceremony, to avoid public outbursts, Sultan Arafa was formally coronated as the new ruler of Morocco. A cousin of the former Sultan Mohammad V, Arafa took the throne following the controversial removal and exile of Mohammad V by French officials. Although some major rural tribal leaders refused to attend the coronation, the new monarch did get confirmed by the ulema. The coronation is being widely condemned across Morocco, especially in the cities where Arafa is often referred to in disdain as the French Sultan. Whether the new Sultan can hold on to his throne remains to be seen." 
 second_rif_revolt.1.d:0 "Moroccans in the Rif have risen in revolt against continued government misrule. The first Rif War occurred in the 1920s and was only put down by the Spanish after extensive human and financial cost. The rebels are being supported by Moroccans across the country who have poured in to join the monarchial struggle. The Morrocan government is accusing forieg Pan-Arabists of supporting the rebels with arms, troops, and training. Pan-Arab leaders across the region meanwhile call the uprising a natural reaction of a people tired of foreign occupation and interference." 
 Ifni_War.1.d:0 "Over the past several months, Spanish authorities in Spanish West Africa have faced massive Moroccan protests and a wave of killings targeting pro-Spanish leaders. With Moroccan unrest increasing, Spain ordered a mobilization of its forces, resulting in Morocco mobilizing its own troops. The Spanish forces soon found their communications cut off and under attack by the Moroccan Liberation Army backed by Moroccan troops in the area. The Spanish forces are on the defensive, with fears in Madrid that Sidi Ifni is under threat with Moroccan forces seizing armories around the city. So far the Spanish lines are holding firm but the situation has escalated into a shooting war between Spain and the Liberation Army supported by Moroccan troops in the region."
 Ifni_War.2.d:0 "After intense fighting, Spain and Morocco recently signed an agreement bringing the Ifni War to a close. Spain has agreed to cede the region of Tarfaya, with Spain retaining control of Spanish Sahara and Sidi Ifni. The Moroccan government is portraying the agreement as an indication of their military victory over Spain. However, analysts note the failure of Morocco to acquire all the territories indicate they failed to achieve a military victory. Although Spain successfully retained most of its territory and successfully blunted the Moroccan attack, the costs were heavy and many in Madrid are questioning the costs needed to maintain colonial territories."
 Ifni_War.3.d:0 "The Moroccan attempt to seize Spanish possessions in the Western Sahara through its Liberation Army resulted in a disastrous defeat. Spanish forces quickly beat back the initial Moroccan assault on Sidi Ifni. Efforts by the Moroccans to regain the initiative or even fortify strategic territories failed due to effective Spanish operations. The Moroccans could not handle the discipline, heavy weapons, or tactics of Spanish forces. The Moroccan government has tried to portray the situation as a victory, however, the failure of any territorial gains and rumors of retreating troops have made the reality clear. In Madrid, the Spanish government congratulated its forces and announced a series of parades and medals to commemorate the victory." 
 Ifni_War.4.d:0 "The Spanish government announced the complete withdrawal of its forces from the Western Sahara. This indicates a complete military defeat in their conflict against the Moroccan-backed Liberation Army. Moroccan forces were able to break through Spanish lines, isolate Spanish garrisons across the regions and successfully overran key positions and towns. The Moroccan government announced the liberation of the Western Sahara and released pictures of Moroccan forces celebrating in liberated towns. Thousands took to the street to celebrate this momentous victory over an occupying colonial power. The Moroccan government is receiving messages of congratulations from fellow anti-colonial states. The confidence of Moroccans is now at an all-time high."
 REVOLUTION_KING.5.d:0 "Since the beginning of the anti-colonial struggle in Morocco, the monarchy has stood with the people. King Mohammad V embodies the desires of his people. By his actions, often subtle, he demonstrates his support and sympathy to nationalists across the nation. He does so in defiance of pro-colonial elites and the colonial powers who previously were major supporters of the throne. However, these enemies of the people recently sought to depose the King. As the King sits in exile, the people of Morocco have taken to the streets, gone on strike, and are demanding the return of the King. The fervor for independence is surging."
 REVOLUTION_KING.6.d:0 "In a landmark agreement, Mohammad V and the French government signed a declaration laying the foundation for Moroccan independence. During the talks, held in La Celle Saint Cloud, France will allow the restoration of Mohammad V to the throne. In return, the King agreed on a roadmap to independence based on Franco-Moroccan Interdependence. Both parties view the agreement as a successful compromise and peaceful resolution to the current unrest. Although there are concerns among some nationalists about the gradual road to independence, many are willing to trust in Mohammad V."
 REVOLUTION_KING.2.d:0 "The former monarch, Mohammad V of Morocco walked out of negotiations with the French government in La Celle Saint Cloud. It appears neither party was able to secure a compromise. Although both sides did initially agree on restoring Mohammad V to the throne, talks on independence quickly fell apart. The French insisted on a roadmap to independence based on Franco-Moroccan Interdependence. Although France promised this would not last long and end in complete independence, the Moroccans felt the condition was a ploy for continued French colonialism. The French will likely be extremely disappointed by the failed negotiations. In Morocco, there are reports that leaders of the nationalist Istiqlal Party are calling for an armed uprising to finally rid the country of colonial occupation."
 REVOLUTION_KING.0.d:0 "The situation in Morocco is deteriorating for the French. Their recent effort to depose the pro-independence King Muhammad V and replace him with a pro-French cousin has backfired. The Moroccan people reject the new King as a puppet. There are large protests, strikes, and violence across the country. The French government is concerned by the spiraling costs. More significantly, if the violence continues, there are concerns of more radical factions gaining influence among the Moroccans. Plans are in place for the French Foreign Minister to meet Mohammad V in La Celle Saint Cloud."

 Arafa.0.d:0 "The recently enthroned King Arafa of Morocco narrowly survived an assassination attempt by Allal ben Abdallah. The King, traveling on horseback with a procession, was targeted when the assassin drove his car into the horse carrying the king. The assassin then jumped out to stab King Arafa but was pounced on by a French policeman. The officer, stabbed during the ensuring struggle, wrestled the assassin to the ground before the would-be assassin was shot to death. Although the King fell from his horse, he suffered minor injuries and left the scene under heavy protection. King Arafa took the throne after his cousin, King Mohammad V, was forced into exile by the French. Many Moroccans feel King Arafa is a French puppet and this latest incident suggests Moroccan anger to French colonialism remains high."
 second_rif_revolt.0.d:0 "Political leaders in the Rif sent a list of 18 Demands to the Moroccan government. The people of the Rif have longed complained of developmental and political neglect to the region. This despite its cherished record of anti-colonial activism and resistance. The Moroccan government is likely to not be happy with this public demand, as it could set a dangerous precedent and provoke anger among some segments of the population. However, a failure to respond positively could cause a violent reaction from a people adept at guerrilla warfare."
