It has no central differential, which means that turning on front-wheel drive will send different amounts of torque to the front an rear axles; there is no option to send the same torque to each axle, therefore, the all-wheel drive system is not suited for on-road driving. The cab was manufactured in several different versions, such as a closed cab, crew cab, cab with soft top, and a cab with fold-down windscreen. The G5 series and H6 series, which were built in Werdau simultaneously, share several components."
