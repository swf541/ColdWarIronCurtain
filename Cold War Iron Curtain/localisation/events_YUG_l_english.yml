However, starting from today, that is no more! Today, my friends, will start a new decade for us, as we shall become Greater Croatia!, the leading figure of the group said in a speech. Moments after this, he and the other members executed Tito and the other politicians. Nations around the world are shocked by this and many of the people of former Yugoslavia are scared about what this means for them.

Although the conflict necessary to bring the two other states under control was brutal and occasionally bloody, the region now holds its breath as a new era begins without the every-tightening noose of Soviet tyranny lingering over. A dream long suppressed by the whims of imperialist nations strewn across of Europe, the Balkan Federation will now give credence to Tito's dream of a strong, internationalist, socialist, but independent state that will propel the Balkans into the future and safeguard their right to decide its own fate."

 YUG_INTEGRATION.2.d:0 "The Yugoslavian communist party played a major role during World War II to support the Albanian communists and the liberation of Albania from the Axis. When the Albanian communists took over the government after the war, they were still beholden to Yugoslavia due to the wartime links and presence of Yugoslavian soldiers within the country. Recently, Yugoslavia used its influence to push for a purge of anti-Yugoslavian Albanian communist leaders. With these opponents to Yugoslavia influence in prison or removed from power, the Albanian government proved quite willing to accept a proposal from Belgrade for the integration of Albania to Yugoslavia. Integration will benefit the people and make any issues with regards to borders and ethnicities mute. The integration marks the continued march of revolution across a unified Balkans."
 YUG_INTEGRATION.3.d:0 "The communist parties of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have long cooperated and supported one another. The two parties were always strong proponents of uniting the Balkan states under a communist regime to better spread Marxism to the people. Since the end of World War II both nations have resolved the Macedonia question and held extensive discussions on unification. These discussions and negotiations have paid off following the recent decision of the Bulgarian communist party to accept the invitation of Yugoslavia and integrate Bulgaria into it. The Yugoslavian government noted this decision has strengthened the people and communists in both nations and ended any border or ethnic disputes. Yugoslavia is becoming a homeland for all the peoples of the Balkan and under communism, everyone will be equal and grow together. For the Bulgarian communists this decision reflects on their long-held belief in unification of communist regimes across the Balkans."
 YUG_INTEGRATION.1.d:0 "The people of Greece and Yugoslavia both suffered horribly during World War II and many felt abandoned by their pre-war leaders. It was the communist parties of both nations which spearheaded the resistance and eventual liberation. However, where the Yugoslavian communist party succeeded in cementing its control, in Greece the communists had to battle against reactionary forces and foreign interference before triumphing. Yugoslavia recently asked the Greek government to integrate itself and firmly secure their revolutionary victory. After much internal discussion, the Greek government agreed. They believe alone the country risks a counter-revolutionary uprising or interference in their affairs, but unified with Yugoslavia, the state will be too powerful to be challenged. Yugoslavia argues by unifying all the peoples of the Balkans it will end any border or ethnic disputes and more effectively implement communism for the people."
 YUG_GREEK_CIVIL_WAR.1.d:0 "The people of Greece and Yugoslavia were both early victims of Axis aggression and were abandoned by their leaders and allies. Through immense sacrifice, it was the people left behind who freed themselves and only under the leadership of their communist parties. In Yugoslavia the communists secured their position after the war, however, in Greece, the communist party finds itself battling reactionary Greeks. These enemies of the Greek people are only existing because they are openly backed by imperialist powers and are using the services of Greek collaborators to the Nazis. The Central Committee in Belgrade recognizes this situation and has announced it will send Yugoslav men, weapons, and support for the Greek communists and aid them in their struggle. Their eventual victory will be a victory for not just the people of Greece but all the peoples of the Balkans fighting for revolution."

 Informbiro.1.d:0 "The Informbiro Period covers Tito-Stalin split which began in 1948. Yugoslavia was never dependent on Soviet support during World War II, largely liberating itself. It also asserted itself after the war as an ally, not a satellite as the Soviets wished. The Soviets also found the Yugoslav foreign policy to be too independent and undermined the delicate balance the Soviets established with the West. The split came during a 1948 Cominform (Informbiro in Yugoslavian) meeting in which the Yugoslavian communist party was expelled by the Soviet Union and its allies. Since this resolution passed, the relationship between Belgrade and Moscow has declined further, with the Soviets directing all communist parties to break ties and Yugoslavia facing a military buildup on its border. However, this situation allows Yugoslavia to pursue a completely independent policy and this split may allow them unique avenues from which to gather support and expand its influence."
 Yug_1950s.1.d:0 "Yugoslav Radio Television began broadcasting today. This is the first public broadcast system for Yugoslavia. Eight radio and television headquarters have been established, one for each constituent republic and autonomous region that makes up Yugoslavia. The stations will broadcast for local audiences but will emphasize the importance of national unity and cooperation. Important Party events will be covered and announcements regarding regional and national Party activities will be announced. The government hopes Yugoslav Radio Television will a powerful means to unify the nation and encourage understanding across all peoples in the country."
 AntiSovYug.1.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government confirmed that prominent Croatian communist leader Andrija Hebrang recently died in prison. The former head of the Croatian Communist Party was recently arrested, stripped of any party honors, and convicted of collaborating with the Nazis and their Croatian puppet state during the war. Considering Hebrang was arrested by the Germans and survived a concentration camp, many view the charges as being fabricated by Yugoslav intelligence. The likely reason is a belief among the central leadership that the Soviets planned on replacing their leader, Josip Tito, with Hebrang. The recent split between the two communist states has raised tensions and anxiety within Yugoslavia as many fear a pro-Soviet infiltration of the party. The circumstances of his death are suspicious as no cause was given nor has the body been released. The death of Hebrang conveniently removes a threat to the Tito regime."
 Diljas.1.d:0 "Milovan Djilas, a long-time and senior member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia party, was recently appointed to become President of the country. He is widely seen as a successor to current leader Josip Tito. A communist theorist, Djilas became a major critic of the Soviet Union and has been immensely important in articulating the Yugoslavian perspective during the recent split with Moscow. In particular, Djilas has criticized the massive Soviet bureaucratic system and the issues with having the center direct all economic activity. Indeed, the Soviets in the past have openly called for Djilas to be purged. However, the new President enjoys the support of Tito and the senior leadership who have asked him to continue writing articles for the official communist newspaper regarding critiques of the Soviet system and reforms."
 Diljas.2.d:0 "Over the past few months President Milovan Djilas published almost twenty articles in the official Yugoslav communist newspaper critiquing the Soviet model. He began writing these articles under the encouragement of Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. However, these critiques although anti-Soviet, advocate for an alternative, more democratic system of party rule. Djilas has gone as far as to suggest the one-party state maybe a mistake, suggesting leaders be retired to prevent corruption and to open the path for others. This part of his critique led to a Central Committee meeting where several members advocated for Djilas to be purged. After consultations, Josip Tito and his allies decided instead that the critiques of Djilas have merit and the party must accept them. This decision keeps Djilas in power and suggests new reforms are on the way."

After consultations, Josip Tito and his allies concurred that Djilas has gone too far and he must be purged. Djilas has been dismissed from all political posts and he is expected to resign from the party soon. The Tito state still strongly believes in a powerful party with a firm leader to govern Yugoslavia."
 YUG_1950s.2.d:0 "A significant reform of the Yugoslavian constitution was approved recently. The reforms are meant to shift the country towards self-production, self-management, and self-working to cover the running of the economy, education, and local governance. This reflects the Yugoslavian rejection of the Soviet model which it accuses of being overly bureaucratic, centralized, and inefficient. Self-management will reduce state control over these institutions and make managers and administrators held to account by worker councils. These reforms cement the importance of self-management in the development of Yugoslavia. The reforms also emphasize the supreme power of the party, rejecting democratic centralism while also providing more autonomy to the republics and autonomous regions that make up Yugoslavia."
 Diljas.4.d:0 "President Milovan Djilas recently published a series of articles critiquing the Soviet model and suggesting a democratic reform to the current one-party system. This latter critique led to a central committee meeting to discuss whether Djilas and his ideas should be embraced or if he should be purged for his dangerous views. In the end the party embraced Djilas and he recently announced a series of reforms for the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ) party. The new reforms will relax strict party discipline regulations, opening the way for more open debate within the party. It also calls for officials to be rotated from senior posts and retired overtime in order to root out corruption and prevent the monopolization of power. It appears the senior leadership, led by Josip Tito has accepted its own decline as the cost to reforming the party."
 YUG_NATO.1.d:0 "The United States and NATO headquarters recently received an offer from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavian government has offered to apply and join NATO in exchange for the ceding of Trieste to the country. Yugoslavia claims Trieste was occupied territory that Yugoslav forces liberated in the war. The postwar agreement to make it a Free City was only done out of respect for the Allies. Yugoslavia added that giving Trieste would show the Yugoslav people the sincerity of NATO. Several NATO members, especially Italy stated their reservation to the Yugoslav proposal, pointing out such a deal would take away the opinion of the people in Trieste and run contrary to the right of self-determination, leaving NATO vulnerable to communist criticism. Others question whether Yugoslavia can offer much to the alliance as it might end being a Trojan Horse for communism."
 YUG_NATO.3.d:0 "After careful consideration, the United States government informed the Yugoslavian government that it could not accept the handing over of Trieste or Yugoslavia joining NATO. The Americans insisted it had a great deal of admiration for Yugoslavia, especially its wartime successes and resistance to Soviet hegemony. However, the people of Trieste have the right of self-determination and to pick their future. It is not the place for the United States to interfere with that. Privately, within the NATO members there were fears that accepting the deal would lead to tensions among members. In addition, adding Yugoslavia would undermine the anti-communist identity of the organization and integrating their military to NATO standards would be a daunting task that few members wished to engage in. Although Yugoslavia expressed its disappointment with the response and reiterated its claims on Trieste, they did promise to continue engaging positively with the United States and all NATO states."

 #News Events
 YUG_NATO.2.d:0 "NATO formally accepted Yugoslavia as its newest member state. This comes very soon after the recent agreement by Italy to accept Yugoslavian sovereignty over Trieste. The joining of Yugoslavia to NATO gives the alliance a prominent position in the Balkans, with one official saying NATO now could strike the underbelly of the Soviet European system. Many military leaders in NATO eagerly await the prospect of modernizing and then deploying the strong Yugoslavian military forces to safeguard the alliance from Soviet aggression. The Soviet Union condemned the move as an escalation that will lead to a militarization of the Balkans not seen since the Balkan Wars. There are even critics within some NATO member states who see the decision to cede Trieste as a transaction to buy Yugoslavian membership, noting if they could be so easily bought than what is to stop them from accepting a Soviet bribe down the road."
 YUG_50s.1.d:0 "The recent crisis in Hungary saw Yugoslavia engage with both sides in order to facilitate a positive result for all parties. Although some in the West and the Soviet bloc consider the Yugoslavian actions as nefarious, others praised what is being increasingly recognized as a positive neutrality. During the Hungarian crisis, Yugoslavia held talks with senior Soviet leaders and offered them guidance on managing dissent within Hungary. During the fighting the Yugoslavian embassy protected the family and senior members of the Hungarian government being targeted by the Soviet forces. Although seemingly contradictory policies, the Yugoslavians argue they helped mitigate the violence and tensions through taking a stance of promoting a quick, peaceful resolution while remaining neutral. Some nations in the wider global community are studying the Yugoslavian approach as a guide for how they can preserve their national goals while not provoking a reaction from the major powers."
 HungarianRevYug.1.d:0 "The government of Yugoslavia announced its wholehearted support for the recent Soviet intervention in Hungary. The government pointed out that the Hungarian communists had failed to control reactionary elements within Hungarian society. They allowed these forces to corrupt the population which led the uprising. The only way to restore power to the people in Hungary was with the actions of the Soviet Union. The Yugoslavian government also announced it was deploying forces on its border with Hungary in order to prevent anti-revolutionary forces from trying to escape. It urged Hungarians to welcome their communist liberators and turn on those anti-revolutionary forces holding the capital hostage."
 HungarianRevYug.2.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government continues its open support for the Hungarian Revolution and condemns the Soviet aggression. Many Hungarian dissidents are currently under the protection of the Yugoslavian embassy, much to the chagrin of Soviet officials and military leaders. In addition, Yugoslavia continues to argue the Soviet action was the repression of Hungarian revolutionaries who simply wanted to create a revolutionary state which reflected the values of its people. They did not want the Soviet model and its weaknesses to undermine their revolution. The Soviets have already condemned Yugoslavia for its stance, and it appears any hopes of reconciliation between the two leading communist states in Europe appears unlikely."
