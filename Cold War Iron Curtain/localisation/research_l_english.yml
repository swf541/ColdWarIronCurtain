Before combat service companies can be developed, the foundations for portable field structures such as tents, trailers, and van components must be developed."

 ###RECON
 tech_recon:0 "Recon I; Scouts"
 tech_recon_desc:0 "Scouts are the simplest form of recon operative. The scout’s job is to find enemy positions and information about the enemy’s strength and numbers, then relay those back to allied forces. Scouts patrol regions and obtain knowledge of enemy positions. Scouts require simple communications equipment, optics, and lightweight gear."
 tech_recon2:0 "Recon II; Obervsers"
 tech_recon2_desc:0 "Observers are recon units that maintain advanced positions in active combat. Observers maintain knowledge of enemy units and provide important details of enemy attacks, movements, and positions so that allies can take appropriate measures and react to them. Observers need more expensive communications equipment and lightweight combat equipment to defend themselves."
 tech_recon3:0 "Recon III; Spotters"
 tech_recon3_desc:0 "Spotters are observers that are assigned to specific combat elements and provide details on potential targets in active battle. Spotters acquire targets and relay that information to their assigned elements to engage or consider engaging. Spotters require better communications, optics, and coordinate systems to relay precise details on enemy locations."
 tech_recon4:0 "Recon IV; Reece Elite"
 tech_recon4_desc:0 "Recon forces are important elements in an army. Because of their nature, it is important to preserve their lives and survivability in combat.

 tech_recon5:0 "Recon V; Modern Skirmishers"
 tech_recon5_desc:0 "Skirmishers are an advanced form of scout. Historically, skirmishers have been light infantry that act as vanguards to allied positions, harass enemies, and screen enemy positions. In modern combat, many of these skirmishers have been phased out or have minimal survivability. By developing weapons and systems that can provide harassing fire and escape difficult situations, the skirmisher role can be fulfilled in modern combat."
 tech_recon6:0 "Recon VI; Field Spies"
 tech_recon6_desc:0 "Field spies are army espionage elements that disguise themselves as enemy units or civilians in order to evade detection. They do not operate as part of an intelligence agency but rather as part of an army, relaying active locations to an enemy, usually in urban warfare where it is easiest for them to be in position. Field spies require concealable and covert equipment such as compact radios or modified civilian phones in order to operate."
 tech_recon7:0 "Recon VII; Deep-Wire Recon"
 tech_recon7_desc:0 "Deep Wire Recon is a highly advanced operation in which recon elements position themselves far beyond enemy lines in order to relay information. These sorts of deep infiltration tactics require massive levels of trial in order to develop and typically require units to conceal themselves and let the enemy pass. The equipment and camouflaging techniques as well as infiltration tactics are difficult to create but are extremely worthwhile as they can provide the most in-depth information that cannot be acquired by conventional recon elements."
 
 ###MECH RECON
 
 tech_mech_recon:0 "Mechanized Recon I; Motorized Scouts"
 tech_mech_recon_desc:0 "Scouts are the simplest form of recon operative. The scout’s job is to find enemy positions and information about the enemy’s strength and numbers, then relay those back to allied forces. Scouts patrol regions and obtain knowledge of enemy positions. Scouts require simple communications equipment, optics, and lightweight gear. Motorized scouts use fast moving, decently armored vehicles to patrol areas more quickly."
 tech_mech_recon2:0 "Mechanized Recon II; Forward Obervsers"
 tech_mech_recon2_desc:0 "Observers are recon units that maintain advanced positions in active combat. Observers maintain knowledge of enemy units and provide important details of enemy attacks, movements, and positions so that allies can take appropriate measures and react to them. Observers need more expensive communications equipment and lightweight combat equipment to defend themselves. Forward Observers use equipment such as helicopters or recon vehicles to maintain better visuals."
 tech_mech_recon3:0 "Mechanized Recon III; Mechanzied Spotters"
 tech_mech_recon3_desc:0 "Spotters are observers that are assigned to specific combat elements and provide details on potential targets in active battle. Spotters acquire targets and relay that information to their assigned elements to engage or consider engaging.

Mechanized spotters use heavily armored vehicles with strong optics to acquire targets."
 tech_mech_recon4:0 "Mechanized Recon IV; Mobile Reece Task Elite"
 tech_mech_recon4_desc:0 "Recon forces are important elements in an army. Because of their nature, it is important to preserve their lives and survivability in combat. By introducing a more advanced combat training and survival regimen, recon forces can survive for longer periods of time and become resistant to ambushes and abrupt strikes. Developing expensive high-end scout vehicles can further aid in the survivability of scouts."
 tech_mech_recon5:0 "Mechanized Recon V; Modern Advanced Skirmishers"
 tech_mech_recon5_desc:0 "Skirmishers are an advanced form of scout. Historically, skirmishers have been light infantry that act as vanguards to allied positions, harass enemies, and screen enemy positions. In modern combat, many of these skirmishers have been phased out or have minimal survivability. By developing weapons and systems that can provide harassing fire and escape difficult situations, the skirmisher role can be fulfilled in modern combat. Providing scout tanks with smoke screens and modern chaff dispensers can greatly aid in their ability to harass the enemy and survive returning fire."
 tech_mech_recon6:0 "Mechanized Recon VI; Advanced Field Spies"
 tech_mech_recon6_desc:0 "Field spies are army espionage elements that disguise themselves as enemy units or civilians in order to evade detection. They do not operate as part of an intelligence agency but rather as part of an army, relaying active locations to an enemy, usually in urban warfare where it is easiest for them to be in position. Field spies require concealable and covert equipment such as compact radios or modified civilian phones in order to operate. Utilizing civilian vehicles, field spies can infiltrate urban and rural positions faster and potentially blend in."
 tech_mech_recon7:0 "Mechanized Recon VII; Mobile Deep-Wire Recon"
 tech_mech_recon7_desc:0 "Deep Wire Recon is a highly advanced operation in which recon elements position themselves far beyond enemy lines in order to relay information. These sorts of deep infiltration tactics require massive levels of trial in order to develop and typically require units to conceal themselves and let the enemy pass. The equipment and camouflaging techniques as well as infiltration tactics are difficult to create but are extremely worthwhile as they can provide the most in-depth information that cannot be acquired by conventional recon elements."

 tech_engineers4_desc:0 "Junglers are combat engineers that clear areas of jungle using defoilants or fire as well as improved tools for creating jungle fortifications. Doing this aids combat and allows for combat engineers to provide an important edge in the difficult jungle environment. However, most of the development of junglers goes into techniques and jungle warfare theories, as a result they dont assist any other combat environments."
 tech_engineers5:0 "Engineer V; Combat Engineers"
 tech_engineers5_desc:0 "Combat Engineers may need to play a more direct role in combat. At some point, they need to build advanced forward bases within’ hotzones. Combat engineers need to be able to set up fortifications and advanced bases in extremely short amounts of time and of high quality. This requires even more advanced individual equipment, a rapid supply train that can deliver all the materials necessary, and more durable gear for sustaining in dangerous zones."
 tech_engineers6:0 "Engineer VI; Pioneers"
 tech_engineers6_desc:0 "Pioneers are combat engineers that can take on any environment and any regional challenge in the world.

Urban warfare engineers are specialists in urban warfare and are capable of erecting advanced fortifications and facilities in urban environments. Not only can they improve the combat capability of troops in urban environments, but they can also deal with urban hazards resulting from warfare such as rubble, exposed electrical wires, toxic floods, and so forth. These guys make urban warfare slightly less of a Hell for your troops and the manifestation of Eternal Fire itself for the enemy.\nField Engineers are the evolution of defenders. Field Engineers specialize in erecting improved facilities, defences, and clearing paths. Using more developed equipment, field engineers are able to clear paths faster and construct quicker than ever before."
 
 ###ARMORED ENGINEERS 
 tech_armor_engineers:0 "Armored Engineer I; Motorized Defenders"
 tech_armor_engineers_desc:0 "Defenders are the most basic form of combat engineers. Defenders perform the basic task of constructing entrenchments and setting up defensive structures, clearing paths, and setting up basic camps. Defenders require basic tools like shovels and axes, basic fortification kits, and mines. Motorized Defenders use construction vehicles and supply trucks in order to aid their fortification efforts."
 tech_armor_engineers2:0 "Armored Engineer II; Mechanized Sappers"
 tech_armor_engineers2_desc:0 "Sappers are another name for combat engineer. At this point, sappers are used for more direct combat tasks such as breaching fortifications and running counter operations to clear minefields and obstacles. Sappers require breaching charges, high explosives, minefield clearing equipment, flamethrowers, bolt cutters, and other pieces of equipment necessary to counteract fortifications. Mechanized Sappers use bunker busting vehicles and supply trucks in order to aid their assaults and better support the primary attackers."

 ###HOSPITAL
 
 tech_field_hospital:0 "Medicine I; Medical Company"
 tech_field_hospital_desc:0 "Medical companies are support companies comprised of medical staff including field surgeons, combat medics, nurses, and so on. They tend to the health and well-being of soldiers in the field. The simplest medical companies simply equip medical personnel with lightweight equipment and give them training and discipline to handle the horrors of war. It isn’t necessary to train them to work under pressure and time constraints because medical personnel always have to work like that."
 tech_field_hospital2:0 "Medicine II; Field Hospitals"
 tech_field_hospital2_desc:0 "Creating portable field hospitals greatly aids in assisting the wounded. Incapacitated soldiers taken to field hospitals where medical equipment is set up have a much greater chance of surviving than medics trying to patch them up while they are getting shot at in the mud. Field hospitals must have lightweight equipment and armored field ambulances in order to be portable with the army and recover soldiers during active battle."
 tech_field_hospital3:0 "Medicine III; Portable Hospital Equipment"
 tech_field_hospital3_desc:0 "While having massive machines and full hospital beds with monitors can be great ways to save lives, brick-and-mortar hospitals are unfortunately not transportable. Creating lightweight, portable variants of medical equipment found in hospitals allows field hospitals to more closely match their permanent counterparts and further aid the lives of soldiers."
 tech_field_hospital4:0 "Medicine IV; Adv Physio/Psycho Conditioning"
 tech_field_hospital4_desc:0 "Naturally, it helps to be healthy when your life's on the line and it makes the doctor’s job easy and gives a better chance of survival. Through medical research, medical companies can monitor and improve the physical and mental health of the soldiers in the field in order to ensure that they have strong bones, muscles, immune systems, and minds so that they can better survive the trauma of medical injuries in battle."
 tech_field_hospital5:0 "Medicine V; Military Medical Research"
 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "Civilian doctors and medical researchers (hopefully) do not have to deal with vast levels of patients coming in with extreme combat injuries on a regular basis. It is for this reason that the art of combat medicine only gained scientific insight when wars are in progress or the country is vastly unstable. Although if a country is unstable, there aren’t likely to be that many doctors with well funded hospitals. Therefore, it is prudent to include medical researchers who can study and create new techniques and medical supplies to deal with combat injuries."
 tech_field_hospital6:0 "Medicine VI; Military Psychiatrists"
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "Not everyone who is put out of commission in the military is killed or wounded. The violent and hellish nature of warfare leaves many soldiers with PTSD. This unfortunate state leaves veterans infirm or unable to return to civilian life and unable to continue serving in the military. Military psychiatrists exist to aid mentally traumatized soldiers and allow them to continue serving in the military or be discharged and able to peacefully return to civilian life with minimal to no psychiatric problems or PTSD triggers."
 tech_field_hospital7:0 "Medicine VII; Military Trauma Medicine"
 tech_field_hospital7_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of CIMR, trauma medicine involves specialized equipment to deal with extreme injuries and stabilize severe physiological problems associated with major trauma. This, combined with the necessity of lightweight, compact medicine in warfare pushes medical ingenuity to its brink. This includes temporary artificial organs that perform simple tasks, high potency anesthetics, highly advanced aids, and miniaturized trauma ward equipment. Military trauma medicine can bring soldiers that would be considered doomed in prior years back from the edge."
 
 ##LOGISTICS 
 
 tech_logistics_company:0 "Logistics I; Logistic Corps"
 tech_logistics_company_desc:0 "Logistic Corps are dedicated non-combat personnel who provide supply and provisions to an army. One of the most important elements of an army, logistic corps provide ammunition, provisions, and spare parts to an army so that it can continue fighting. Additionally, specialized corps and officers manage networks and reduce waste which can greatly help reduce total consumption."
 tech_logistics_company2:0 "Logistics II; Convoy Escorts"
 tech_logistics_company2_desc:0 "Logistics convoys are prime targets for infiltration operatives and behind-enemy-lines operations. By gauging risks and securing supply lines with patrols and escorts, supplies can be protected and valuable provisions that are normally destroyed can be saved, further reducing overall consumption."
 tech_logistics_company3:0 "Logistics III; Supply Standardization"
 tech_logistics_company3_desc:0 "Different manufacturers or regions will usually have their own ways of storing and labelling provisions. This can cause a serious burden for logistical corps. As such, it is important to develop a national standardized catalog of military provisions to make it easier for supply officers to manage."
 tech_logistics_company4:0 "Logistics IV; Light/Compact Containers"
 tech_logistics_company4_desc:0 "Weight is a serious concern in logistics. Vehicles can only transport so much weight and even still have restrictions to the volume of contents they can transport. By creating lightweight, strong, compact containers, more supply can be shipped faster and more fuel efficiently."
 tech_logistics_company5:0 "Logistics V; All-Terrain Supply Corps"
 tech_logistics_company5_desc:0 "You cannot always rely on using your enemy’s infrastructure and roads. They may be destroyed in an action of scorched earth or may not exist in the first place. On that note, you can’t always rely on your own infrastructure not being destroyed or even existing. It is important that supply vehicles and logistics officers be able to travel off-road and find new paths in order to improve movement."
 tech_logistics_company6:0 "Logistics VI; Efficient Air Missions"
 tech_logistics_company6_desc:0 "Air missions and paradropped supplies can be lost, destroyed, captured by the enemy or partisans, or even take up large quantities of fuel to deliver. By revising paradropping plans and the chutes themselves, air missions can deliver needed supply in faster amounts of time. "
 tech_logistics_company7:0 "Logistics VII; High-Capacity Vehicles"
 tech_logistics_company7_desc:0 "When all management methods and protocols have been fully optimized, the only thing left to do is just make vehicles stronger, more efficient, and hold more. That’s all there is to it."
 
 ##MP
 
 tech_military_police:0 "Military Police I; MP Corps"
 tech_military_police_desc:0 "Military Police are dedicated officer corps that maintain order within’ a division as well as provide security in a combat zone. War is, by its very nature, destructive. Government officials, police, and security operatives are natural targets and belligerents in a conflict so military police must retain order and suppress insurgency. Basic military police are no more advanced or different from normal police forces with the exception of more combat training and the ability to establish beats within’ an unfamiliar zone."
 tech_military_police2:0 "Military Police II; Counter-Insurgent Operations"
 tech_military_police2_desc:0 "Insurgents and partisans can be extremely dangerous to a war operation and provide problems on a strategic level. From sabotose to ambushes to providing the enemy with intel, anyone can become an insurgent. Being able to hunt insurgents and partisans and suppress rebellion in a warzone is a critical operation. Firearms and weapons must be confiscated, militia cells must be found and destroyed, and the operatives themselves must be terminated. Therefore special equipment and militarized variants of police equipment must be made and protocols for suppression must be planned."
 tech_military_police3:0 "Military Police III; Riot Control"
 tech_military_police3_desc:0 "Aside from militia cells, disorganized riots can also arise from rebelling populations who do not have an understanding of guerilla warfare or resistance theory. Although not as dangerous as a fully organized militia cell, riots can cause serious disorder, prevent access to resources and industry, and rally support for partisans. It is therefore necessary to control and put down riots. However, using shear lethal force, although easy and effective, only radicalizes local populations and fulfills the riot’s initial purpose. Thus, developing military grade riot control techniques in order to maintain order and suppress demonstration is of vital importance."
 tech_military_police4:0 "Military Police IV; War Relief Corps"
 tech_military_police4_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely suppress resistance and pacify populations. Peaceful resistance is always possible and can be problematic. Additionally, the shear devastation caused by war can lead partisans to form cells. Providing war relief is prudent for numerous reasons. War relief helps a region recover faster during and after a war. War relief helps maintain wealth and development that would otherwise be lost. War relief speeds up recovery. Finally, providing war relief can win the most important war of all. The war of hearts and minds. "
 tech_military_police5:0 "Military Police V; Peacekeeping"
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "Peacekeeping is a proactive measure to preventing uprisings and reducing devastation. Peacekeeping operations typically involve training new, local security forces to enforce the law and restore normalcy. Order and stability are the greatest methods of pacification. Peacekeeping requires military police to be trained to establish local security and vet for individuals who will not wind up becoming problems to become those security operatives. Additionally, it requires logistical lines for security provisions to be established so security beats can be established."
 tech_military_police6:0 "Military Police VI; Memetic Suppression"
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "Winning hearts and minds with war relief and peacekeeping are good ways to prevent insurgency. However, not everyone is convinced, especially patriots and demagogues. It is therefore necessary to use fear as a tool to suppress other individuals. However, this fear cannot be delivered in such a way that it interferes with war relief or peacekeeping. Military reporters, propaganda, memetic warfare and ideological debating, and other such methods are ways to sow doubt within’ an occupied population. "
 tech_military_police7:0 "Military Police VII; Modern Non-Lethal Weapons and Tactics"
 tech_military_police7_desc:0 "Non-lethal tactics and weapons have been used since the dawn of human civilization and are naturally a part of occupation. However, dealing with domestic crime is a different game than dealing with insurgents. To better control the population and not inspire resistance and provide psychological suppression, new methods for incapacitation must be created. Investing large amounts into developing non-lethal weapons, chemicals, training, and equipment will pay off by enabling smaller amounts of troops to have a greater suppressive impact."
 
 ##SIGNAL
 
 tech_signal_company:0 "Signal I; Command and Control"
 tech_signal_company_desc:0 "Signal Companies maintain organization and communication within’ a division and outside of it. Using communications equipment, signal companies can aid in the command and control of a division and enable it to react to situations better than before. Command and Control requires signal specialists and communications equipment."
 tech_signal_company2:0 "Signal II; C3"
 tech_signal_company2_desc:0 "C3 stands for Communications, Command, and Control. With the implementation of C3, units can now communicate between one another and react dynamically to enemy movements and breakthroughs and respond accordingly. C3 requires signal specialists to be integrated throughout a division in many different areas to relay information and provide greater awareness."
 tech_signal_company3:0 "Signal III; Interoperability"
 tech_signal_company3_desc:0 "Interoperability is the advancement of C3. Interoperability is the advancement of doctrines in communication and direct efforts between combat elements. This way, combat elements are able to communicate with each-other without the need of a signal liaison and can aid each-other through their own initiative. "
 tech_signal_company4:0 "Signal IV; ISTAR"
 tech_signal_company4_desc:0 "ISTAR stands for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance. It is the active communication between recon elements and everyone on the communications network. ISTAR enables recon elements to communicate information to the rest of a division with high efficiency. It also enables undedicated recon elements to aid in providing information to combat elements that need them."
 tech_signal_company5:0 "Signal V; MISI"
 tech_signal_company5_desc:0 "Modern Informations System Integration [MISI] is the integration of modern systems information such as portable computers to aid in tactical control. With MISI, unparalleled levels of direct tactical control can be established between command staff and the operating combat elements. MISI enables consultation between experienced senior staff and low-ranking officers to provide greater combat and tactical capability."
 tech_signal_company6:0 "Signal VI; Personal Comms"
 tech_signal_company6_desc:0 "Personal Comms are pieces of communications equipment granted to almost all individuals within’ a division. This can further allow communications to be maintained as the incapacitation of a signals specialist does not necessarily mean the end of communications. Developing personal comms requires miniaturization of communications equipment and protocols for cutting off the operability of compromised equipment."
 tech_signal_company7:0 "Signal VII; OVERLORD"
 tech_signal_company7_desc:0 "OVERLORD is a theoretical battle interface that has not yet been fully implemented by any country due to the sheer expense of developing the software needed and maintaining and updating it. OVERLORD creates an interface created and updated by command staff based off of continuous recon reports and information coming in. This allows for a level of interoperability, communication, and command never before seen that can enable virtually all troops to receive information on nearby troops and avoid conflicts they cannot deal with while precisely engaging hostiles they are able to. As long as someone is aware of an enemy presence, and communications are still online, everyone can be aware of it. "
 
 ##MAINTENANCE 
 
 tech_maintenance_company:0 "Maintenance I; Army Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company_desc:0 "Maintenance companies are dedicated non-combat units that specialize in the maintenance and repair of military weapons and equipment. While most routine cleaning and maintenance can be performed by the soldiers that operate the weapons and equipment, dedicated mechanics can do the job more efficiently and relieve a lot of the effort on part from the soldiers themselves so they can focus on other things. Mechanics are the most basic but amongst the most important elements of a maintenance company."
 tech_maintenance_company2:0 "Maintenance II; Management"

 tech_maintenance_company5:0 "Maintenance V; Versitile Parts"
 tech_maintenance_company5_desc:0 "In warfare it isn’t uncommon to find maintenance companies running out of components or spare parts. The parts that are damaged or destroyed are highly inconsistent and unpredictable due to the nature of combat. It is for this reason that having stores of extra versatile parts and patching kits that are intended to only be applied temporarily is desirable. Through intense development efforts and investment, these kits and parts can be created for field repairs in order to keep vehicles and weapons in the fight long enough that they can receive permanent repairs."
 tech_maintenance_company6:0 "Maintenance VI; Combat Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company6_desc:0 "The most dire repair situations can occur in the heat of a firefight. Tanks can become detracked, vehicles can be shot, and various other forms of damage can occur. Field repairs have always been a difficult task and have always been pressing. By training mechanics to work faster and under intense pressure, they can conduct these repairs more efficiently and get their vehicles back in the fight."

 USA_team_weapons_1: "M1919 Browning [HMG], M1 Mortar[Mortar]"
 USA_team_weapons_1_short: "M1919 Browning, M1 Mortar"
 USA_team_weapons_1_desc: "The M1919 Browning is a heavy machine gun developed in 1919 by John Browning. The weapon became iconic after its famous usage during the Great Emu War but it was also used during WWII. The weapon uses .30 caliber rounds and had a short-recoil operation action and has an effective range of 1500 yards. Its predecessor, the M1917 was water cooled but the water cooling was removed to lighten the weapon at the cost of firing time. This proved to be dangerous as when overheated, the propellent could heat up and lead to the shots firing without warning which would lead to uncontrollable fire./nThe M1 mortar is a variant of the French Brandt mortar created by the US close to their initial joining of WWII. It fires an 81mm caliber mortar up to 1.9 miles. It was used extensively during WWII and was also used in Vietnam and Korea."
 USA_team_weapons_2: "M2 Browning [HMG], M29 Mortar[Mortar], M75[HGL]"
 USA_team_weapons_2_short: "M2 Browning, M29 Mortar, M75"
 USA_team_weapons_2_desc: "The M2 Browning is an HMG that is typically mounted on vehicles but may also be used as an emplaced gun. It fires .50 caliber rounds and has much more firepower than the M1919. It was designed in 1919 by John Browning and used throughout WWII. It is similar in complexity and quality as the M1919 but is heavier and carries heavier ammunition./nThe M29 mortar is an American mortar built to replace the M1 mortar in 1952 by an ad-hoc team. It can fire 4-12 rounds per minute and is far lighter and has a greater range.

The NSVT is well known for being mounted on Soviet MBTs such as the 64, the 72, and the 80.\nThe 2B14 is a modern light indirect fire mortar designed in 1983 by the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant for use in airborne and light infantry forces. The weapon fires a 82mm modern mortar and has a fire rate of approximately 24 rounds per minute. Its high rate of fire and efficient logistical design made it an excellent weapon for the Soviets and saw usage well outside its intended purpose including motor rifle units. Its success was seen largely during the Afghan war."

 SOV_team_weapons_5_desc: "The Kord 6P50 is a Russian HMG designed by Namitulin, Obidin, Bogdanov, and Zhirokhin. The weapon has extensive changes over the former NSVT including a rotating bolt replacing the pivoting breech lock, an improved gas system, and reworked muzzle baffle. The gun has much less recoil giving it higher accuracy and longer sustained fire times, making it better for suppressing fire and long range fire support. It is also vastly lighter and produces a higher volume of fire. It has seen combat in a large variety of modern Russian and Russian-sphere conflicts including the Russo-Georgian war and the Syrian Civil war. There are also reports that it has been seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with the US albeit rarely.\nThe ASG-30 is a heavy grenade launcher developed in 1990 by the KBP bureau for the Soviet Union but was not adopted until after the dissolution in 1995 by the Russian federation. It fires at a rate of 400 rounds per minute and is equipped with a blowback action. Its design is based heavily off of the AGS-17 and is massively lighter, more mobile, has a longer range, and is more accurate. The launcher has gained notable prestige in its capability to take down fortified enemies. Its capability was proven in the second Chechen war where it proved to be a highly capable weapon."

The warhead always self-destructs after 6 seconds which places a definite limit. The RPG-18 was not used as much as the RPG-7 nor has it made its way around the world as much due to the fact that it cannot be reloaded. It is, however, very cheap despite being more logistically cumbersome as each tube only fires once. It was used extensively in various wars by China as well as the Soviet-Afghan war."

It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective.

KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive. The Strela-3 was used in many different middle eastern conflicts such as the Iraq-Iran war, but didn’t see much combat within’ the Soviet sphere itself."

 ####Armor Tree Desc
 arm_sht_desc:0 "These behemoths are nearly indestructible, but their use is also very limited."
 arm_ht_desc:0 "Heavy tank\n Heavy tanks are protected against nearly all types of weapons, but their utility is limited by poor mobility.\n\nArmored Engineer Vehicle\n These heavy vehicles serve special roles such as deploying bridges, breaching obstacles, and moving earth to support mechanized forces."
 arm_mt_desc:0 "MBT\n Main Battle Tanks are balanced between the armor and firepower of heavy tanks and the mobility of light tanks.\n\nSP artillery\n Self Propelled artillery can deal significant damage from a distance to both infantry and lightly-armored vehicles." 
 arm_lt_desc:0 "The armor of light tanks won't withstand hits from larger guns, but it can protect against small arms. Light tanks are significantly more mobile than their heavier counterparts."
 arm_mech_desc:0 "APC\n Armored Personnel Carriers provide improved mobility and protection to infantry.\n\nIFV\n Infantry Fighting Vehicles are less mobile than APCs, but bring heavier armaments and armor to the battlefield.\n\nAirborne APC\n These specialized APCs are equiped for airborne deployment.\n\nATGM carrier\n Dedicated ATGM carriers are the modern army's solution to the threat of MBTs. Missiles are extremely powerful against armored targets but their anti-infantry effectiveness is limited.\n\nRecon vehicle\n Small and nimble vehicles built to scout terrain and assess the composition of enemy forces. They are not equipped for frontline combat."
 arm_mot_desc:0 "Truck\n Trucks grant infantry much greater strategic mobility, but otherwise they don't provide any significant, direct combat value.\n\nSP rocket artillery\n Dedicated to anti-infantry attacks, rocket artillery inflicts very little damage against armored targets."
 arm_amph_desc:0 "Amphibious transports compromise between light and heavy mechanized transports, with improved amphibious capability."
