 SIA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "The Khmer Rouge continue to fire on civilians and move across our border without heeding our warnings. To counter this, we setup a rapid response unit in a border area rife with violations by Khmer fighters. This decision proved to be excellent as a group of enemy fighters were identified crossing the border to hide from government forces. Our unit identified their location and moved quickly, launching an assault that no doubt shocked their commander who thought he could hide out for several days before we responded. The enemy took heavy casualties and were driven back across the border."
 SIA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The Khmer Rouge continue to fire on civilians and move across our border without heeding our warnings. To counter this, we setup a rapid response unit in a border area rife with violations by Khmer fighters. Following reports that a group of Khmer Rouge fighters were positioned on our side of the border following a fight with Cambodian government forces, we deployed our unit to remove them. However, as the men approached, they were hit by an ambush and took casualties before being forced to flee. The Khmer Rouge fighters went on to raid a Thai border village before returning back with captured weapons and supplies. It appears our forces were tactically unprepared for fighters well-versed in the guerrilla tactics of the enemy."
 SIA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Khmer Rouge are strengthening their hold of the countryside and threaten to cutoff the Cambodian capital from its military units operating in rural areas. Such a scenario is not in the interest of our government and it was decided that we will use our own air power to offer limited support against the Khmer Rouge. Using intelligence sources, we discovered a key road intersection being firmly controlled by fighters operating out of a nearby camp. With the camp identified, we deployed planes which bombed the camp. Aerial assessments along with interceptions of enemy communications confirmed the strike was a success and we have hindered the Khmer Rouge in that area."

Unfortunately, aerial assessments along with interceptions of enemy communications confirmed the strike had hit a non-military target, enflaming the emotions of locals in the area. Our strike has only helped increase the popularity of the Khmer Rouge."

 VIE_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "The communist Khmer Rouge help facilitate the movement of men and arms to anti-government forces within our own territory. They operate blatantly on our border and have the blood of many innocents on their hands. To show we will not tolerate a hostile force on our border we recently launched a raid into Cambodia. Our men assaulted an enemy camp, inflicting heavy casualties, capturing documents, and more importantly we found a huge store of food and weapons destined to our enemies. Our men destroyed all of it before returning back. This operation shows we will not tolerate Khmer Rouge and their allies interfering in our affairs and our actions give support to the Cambodian government."

However, as the men approached the targeted camp, it appears they did not surprise the Khmer Rouge who setup an ambush. They inflicted heavy casualties and forced our men to return across the border. The Khmer Rouge are using this raid as evidence of a Vietnamese invasion to recruit more people and drive a wedge between us and the Cambodian government who are now publicly condemning our actions as well to save face."
 VIE_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "Aerial reconnaissance shows clearly how extensive Khmer Rouge support for our enemies is. They are facilitating the movement of weapons, men, and supplies into our nation which is fueling the fighting in our lands. Using intelligence from friendly sources, we discovered a major concentration of fuel, ammunition, and supplies near the border. We dispatched several fighters who successfully bombed this target, resulting in massive explosions and the destruction of all those supplies. The Khmer Rouge guarding the facility were also destroyed and we believe the operation will hinder their operations along with our enemies."

Using intelligence from friendly sources, we discovered a major concentration of fuel, ammunition, and supplies near the border. We dispatched several fighters but as they approached the target, they took on heavy anti-aircraft fire from the ground. The planes dumped their bombs and returned to base, luckily taking no casualties. However, the bombs did damage local farmlands and one bomb landed near a village. This has been used to galvanize support for the Khmer Rouge in the area."

 USA_CAM_Inusrgency_Options.5.d:0 "Apparently the United States has reached a tacit agreement with the Cambodian government allowing it to bomb the Khmer Rouge sanctuaries near the border with Vietnam. Massive B-52 bombers have begun an intense campaign of bombing which has resulted in the destruction of material, personnel, and bases within the Khmer Rouge areas. The United States hopes its operations will prevent the flow of communist arms to South Vietnam and hinder Khmer Rouge operations by destroying their supply base. Although the damage is devastating and has had an effect, ultimately the Khmer Rouge appear to be adapting and are still able to conduct its missions despite the recent American air offensive. The United States is calling its bombing campaign Operation Menu."

 CAM_insurgency_options.15.d:0 "The government of Cambodia recently launched a large offensive to drive back the Khmer Rouge and help secure the country from the communist threat. The Khmer Rouge had been deploying its forces to control key roads and positions in order to isolate government units from one another. This offensive aimed to restore government control of these roads and secure contact with the military forces in the countryside and the capital. The offensive achieved its objectives, the operation saw several units move in conjunction to surround Khmer Rouge forces and secure the supply routes. Stores of enemy supplies, fuel, and weapons were also seized during the operation. The effective use of artillery and good coordination among commanders ensured the operation succeeded. With this victory the enemy is on the defensive and some feel the tide is now turning."

The Khmer Rouge had been deploying its forces to control key roads and positions in order to isolate government units from one another. This offensive aimed to restore government control of these roads and secure contact with the military forces in the countryside and the capital. Unfortunately, the offensive has ended in failure. Communication between units ended up being poor and multiple units came under intense enemy fire. Support artillery proved lacking at times and by the end of the offensive almost all units were back in their starting position, with some of the more isolated ones even more cut off from supply routes. Morale has dropped and a dangerous defensive mindset is now prevailing among the officers."
 CAM_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "One of our unit commanders was notified by a peasant that in a nearby village, the peasants were hording rice, amassing arms, and hosting communist fighters. He took his mend and they stormed in, capturing most of the villagers, including a large number of young men. As they searched the village, they found a hidden storeroom of food, weapons, and supplies. The men were all taken into custody where they can be more properly investigated. What is clear so far is that we raided a major Khmer Rougue operating base for the area and have greatly hindered their supporters and personnel in the area."
 CAM_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "In one of our more rural areas, a unit posted their decided to raid a village in search of Khmer Rouge fighters in the area. Unfortunately, the unit moved very slowly, and we believe they were tracked by the enemy they meant to hunt. When they reached the village, the commanding officer lost control as the men swarmed to take rice and other food from their villagers, apparently the unit was being undersupplied, though we suspect the commander had been selling his unit rations. This enraged villagers and when one group of soldiers strayed to a nearby storehouse they were cutdown my a Khmer Rouge ambush. What men could be organized tried to drive off the enemy but they too fell into an ambush and the unit eventually withdrew chaotically. The raid failed to capture any prisoners or enemy equipment and only helped in alienating the Royal troops from the locals and strengthen leftist morale."
 CAM_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "A regional military command decided to deploy artillery onto a strategic hill from which to rain havoc on enemy forces operating in the area. Using intelligence acquired from a friendly source, we had been told the enemy saw the area as a sort of highway from which to move men and material. This intelligence proved quite accurate as a group of men moving slowly in the jungle were identified and successfully shelled by our artillery. When a patrol went to investigate, they found the men were communist fighters who were carrying a large number of weapons and supplies. Plans are being made to setup these firing positions in other parts of the country."
 CAM_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "In one of our areas, the Khmer Rouge are proving quite aggressive in confronting our forces. The local commander secretly setup artillery and sent out a patrol to draw out enemy forces which would then be taken out by the artillery and mortar fire. However, when the enemy attacked, our artillery crews proved inept due to a lack of training and effective leadership. The shells missed or ended up targeting the patrol, inflicting friendly-fire casualties and helping the communists pin our men down. In the end our forces suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, morale was greatly hindered, and a sense of animosity has developed between the infantry officers and artillery officers in the area."
 CAM_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "Perhaps the greatest advantage for the monarchy is the loyalty and devotion it inspires among all Cambodians, especially the peasants. Even among the most leftist peasants, there are those who still look to the royal family for leadership and guidance. Recently, our intelligence agent identified several of these peasants and asked them to join or offer to aid the Khmer Rouge in a specific area. These peasants then fed us valuable intelligence on the operating procedures, movements, and objectives of the communist fighters. More importantly they listed the villages and village leaders actively aiding the enemy. With this information we have begun slowly rolling up the enemy sympathizers, isolating the communist fighters and will soon wrap them up too, clearing the area of enemy forces."

Recently, our intelligence agent identified several of these peasants and asked them to join or offer to aid the Khmer Rouge in a specific area. These peasants then fed us valuable intelligence on the operating procedures, movements, and objectives of the communist fighters. However, in this case this ended in failure. The peasants it turned out were double agents and instead fed us intelligence we used to disrupt or detain villagers from pro-government villages. By the time we figured this out the damage had been done and now many of the pro-government villages in the area have joined the communists or no longer aid us in identifying enemies."

 CAM_insurgency_options.3a.d:0 "A Khmer Rouge party of fighters were identified crossing back across the border, probably after having undergone some training. They shortly after established a camp deep in the jungle. Our local unit commander organized a raiding party of the top soldiers in his unit and they were able to launch an assault on the camp. Many of the enemy fighters were neutralized, the survivors fled in terror as our men collected several prisoners, propaganda documents, and a cache of weapons. It appears these men had gone abroad for advance training so disrupting them will help weaken communist activities in the area and raise the morale of our forces."
 CAM_insurgency_options.4a.d:0 "The enemy continues to try and isolate our units by intersecting supply routes and attempting to fragment our forces. The effect of this approach was recently felt when a local commander was ordered to hunt down an enemy force which was ambushing supply convoys along an important road. Due to a lack of coordination and communication among units in the area, the commander approached the suspected camp in a direction the enemy easily saw them arriving. The Khmer Rouge setup an ambush outside their camp and as our men moved to assault, they fell into the enemy trap. Heavy casualties were taken by our forces and the enemy ended up expanding their control over the contested road."
 CAM_insurgency_options.5a.d:0 "The anti-communist credentials of our Republic have impressed many nations in the region and the world. They have contributed in subtle or overt ways to our campaign against the Khmer Rouge. Recently, a friendly state offered air support for any operation we chose. We identified on one of the major roadways that a large Khmer Rouge force was intercepting the traffic and at times blocked supplies from the capital to some of our most important units on the border. We provided our friends information from local informants and scouts. Yesterday, using that information the friendly nation sent several planes who bombed the enemy intensely. A patrol sent to assess the situation noted the communist camp had been devastated and the survivors had no doubt fled. This successful bombing cleared the way for our forces to re-establish control in the area and protect the movement of supplies and goods for now."

They have contributed in subtle or overt ways to our campaign against the Khmer Rouge. Recently, a friendly state offered air support for any operation we chose. One of our commanders noted a grouping of villages were essentially bases for Khmer Rouge fighters operating against his forces. With that information the friendly nation dispatched planes who pummeled the targets in order to destroy enemy forces and their infrastructure of support. When a patrol went to investigate, they discovered the planes had misread their information and had not hit the targets, instead they hit pro-government areas. The local people were furious, and the patrol was forced to quickly return, this failed operation has cost us vital local support and only strengthened our communist foes."
 CAM_insurgency_options.1a.d:0 "The devotion our supporters have for the cause against communism cannot be described. Our intelligence agents recently recruited such devoted members to undergo training and go to the countryside. They then joined the local Khmer Rouge in the area. We then received from them valuable intelligence regarding tactics, movements, motivations, and training. This information is being used to help us counter their propaganda and hinder their own movements. In fact, some of our infiltrators are even rising in the ranks and are able to provide the names of villages and community leaders supporting the fighters. With this intelligence we will eventually identity and destroy the Khmer Rouge in the area along with their support networks."
 CAM_insurgency_options.2a.d:0 "The devotion our supporters have for the cause against communism cannot be described. Our intelligence agents recently recruited such devoted members to undergo training and go to the countryside. They then joined the local Khmer Rouge in the area. However, it appears our training was not as thorough, and this band of communists easily identified our spies. They fed them false information and setting up traps which confirmed their suspicions. Overtime this led to a series of tactical defeats and actions by our troops which alienated pro-government supporters. By the time we realized the truth, our infiltrators vanished and one of the intelligence agents involved was also kidnapped by the enemy."

 Rouge_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "The enemy lacks experience in combat or high standards of training. We can draw on the experiences of our comrades in other theatres across the regional and global struggle for revolution. A recent example of this advantage was when our fighters tracked an enemy patrol. They realized the patrol had a tendency to return the way they came, a major tactical military mistake. Our fighters eventually setup a perfect ambush and we attacked the patrol, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing valuable arms and supplies. The morale of our men is higher now and the enemy in the area fears leaving their bases."
 Rouge_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An overconfident leader led his cadre of fighters to assault an enemy outpost. Our fighters failed to properly scout or plan their tactics and betrayed some of the basic principles of our revolutionary style of fighting. In the resulting exchange, the men failed to breach the outpost and suffered heavy losses. The commander is being replaced and the surviving men taken for re-education in proper tactics and techniques. The enemy force ended up being larger than expected and our men moved quite openly, giving away any element of surprise. Even more galling was the failure to use the terrain to our advantage. Such mistakes by our forces, who are not professional soldiers, can be expected at times, but they must be immediately corrected"
 Rouge_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "A local bureaucrat was given a royal award for his years of service to the government. This man publicized the honor he had received. Many of the villagers were impressed and are now saying favorable things about the government and royal family. This is eroding the support our cause has among the oppressed peasants. To stop this, a cadre of fighters planted explosives at the house of the bureaucrat and destroyed it. The message was received and now the bureaucrat refuses to discuss his award when it is brought up and some of the more outspoken villagers are now quiet."
 Rouge_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "The government continues to direct armed thugs to seize the food and money from the peasants. They are bleeding the country dry to feed their own desires and corruption. In one major village the tax collectors have an office. A bomb planting team attempted to blow it up but were captured by local security forces who caught our men with their explosives. The government now tells the villagers our men were trying to plant a bomb which would have killed innocents and destroyed a government store house containing rice. They falsely claim we planned to blow up the rice and cause a shortage of food to further alienate the people from the royal family."
 Rouge_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The government relies heavily on local peasants who have strong attachments to the royal family. They use these simple men and women to collect information on our revolutionary activities. However, the government has grown complacent in some cases and in one area we discovered they accept anyone who pledges loyalty and wants to provide information. We sent several agents to infiltrate the government forces by having them pose as loyal peasants. The operation proves to be a major success as they are providing the government with outdated information and in turn are learning about their tactics and procedures. We are also directing the government to focus on areas we have no fighters to facilitate the movement of our forces. This success has enabled our forces in the area to operate far more effectively."

They use these simple men and women to collect information on our revolutionary activities. We sent several agents to infiltrate the government forces by having them pose as loyal peasants. The operation proves to be a failure as the government recruiters proved adept at vetting our men. They quickly figured out what was happening and brought the men in. However, they ensured our agents did not receive compromising intelligence and tracked them. When they discovered who their handlers were, they arrested the infiltrators and our agents in the area. This has weakened our ability to track the enemy and now the government forces are making gains in this area."

 Rouge_insurgency_options.3a.d:0 "The blatant violence and aggression the government troops show the peasants in their zeal to hunt us and rice for tax collection has gained us great support from the locals. From this information we discovered that most troops at an outpost guarding a key road intersection go on these brutal raiding parties every few days. Although they claim to steal food from the villages for tax collection, many suspect the troops are poorly supplied so are living off the land. Using this information, a group of our men setup around the post. When the government forces moved out to the villages and were a distance away, our men assaulted the lightly defended post. We destroyed what we could not take away and were also able to destroy several vehicles carrying mail and supplies on the road. This successful raid no doubt will weaken the spirit of our opponents and keep them trapped in their outpost as we strengthen our hold in the area."
 Rouge_insurgency_options.4a.d:0 "Our enemy has proclaimed itself the greatest opponent to the communist fervor sweeping our nation. Because of this they can acquire equipment and supplies from friendly states or groups sympathetic to them. This ended up costing one of our cadres who attempted to assault an enemy post from a weak point during the night. Normally such an operation would have been an easy success for our forces as the enemy at this post was observed to ignore basic practices for establishing a defense. However, as our men approached in the open, they suddenly faced heavy fire and after taking casualties were forced to retreat in defeat. We believe the troops at this outpost either had a foreign advisor or some advanced night warfare equipment which they used to defeat our attack."
 Rouge_insurgency_options.5a.d:0 "The government continues to try and convince the people their cause is the right one. However, their alliance to capitalists, corruption, and brutal policies towards the peasants ensures we remain strong in the face of their aggression. Our principle tactic has been to isolate government forces by raiding or intercepting traffic on major roads to prevent the Republican forces from communicating. In a recent operation, a team of mine layers scouted a side road being used by government vehicles to supply the enemy forces in the area. During the night, they managed to plant mines on this road and the next day when the supply vehicles arrived, they were hit by the mines. Since then this team has been tracking the routes taken to supply the enemy troops and continue to mine those routes. This is leading to some panic and an erosion in effectiveness for the government forces."

 Rouge_insurgency_options.1a.d:0 "Many in the government, especially in the mid-level ranks of the military and bureaucracy recognize the inevitability of our revolution. They see the peasants are turning against them and want to ensure they survive. Some even realize the righteousness of our beliefs and wish to join us. Certainly, we take some defectors but recently it was decided to instead use some of those who wish to change sides as agents who provide us information. In one of the larger towns, we successfully recruited several government and military officials to provide us information. From them we learned about their orders, policies, movements, numbers, and morale. With such information we have been able to expand our presence, challenge government propaganda, and further demoralize the government forces in the town. We hope this success will pave the way for us to eventually drive out the enemy."

Certainly, we take some defectors but recently it was decided to instead use some of those who wish to change sides as agents who provide us information. Unfortunately, a recent operation shows this approach can be a double-bladed sword. In a highly contested village, we recruited a mid-level military officer to provide us intelligence and at first the information appeared very useful. However, he manipulated his handler and soon figured out where our forces were largely concentrated. Over the past few days the handler was detained and our forces in the area took heavy losses after a coordinated government attack. It appears our infiltrator was a double agent."

 Rouge_insurgency_options.151.d:0 "Although in many places the government forces appear superior to our forces in terms of manpower, recent engagements indicate they lack morale or the will to sustain fighting. With this in mind, along with the aid of artillery acquired from friendly sources, the military leadership has launched a large-scale offensive to expand our zone of control and put the enemy on the defensive. The attack proved to be a stunning success as government forces melted away when engaged and especially when they came under artillery fire. A key to our success was the decision by commanders to maneuver our men in a way that blocked re-enforcements, especially from pro-government militias to bolster the Cambodian Army units targeted. Currently our forces are consolidating their gains as the enemy seeks to regroup following their losses. The enemy is on the defensive and it appears our revolution in Laos is much closer to fruition."

It appears our assessment had been incorrect. Although initial gains were made against government forces, we failed to block the arrival of pro-government militias who stiffened enemy resistance. In addition, the airpower of the government proved decisive in hitting the artillery and larger concentration of our forces. Our early gains were quickly reversed and after sustaining heavy casualties the attack was called off. For the moment we must be on the defensive."

 CAM_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Cambodian Civil War finally ended with the victorious Khmer Rouge capturing the capital and final government stronghold Phnom Penh. Over the past few months, the Khmer Rouge methodically captured the surrounding areas and eventually surrounded the city. Upon launching their main assault, they faced intense house to house fighting, though they eventually broke government resistance. As the government forces fell apart, the surviving military and civilian leaders sought to escape via helicopter from the Olympic Stadium or by fleeing to the French Embassy. Several senior government officials, including Prime Minister Long Boret were captured in the chaos. With the city captured, the Khmer Rouge immediately ordered the evacuation of all civilians from the city, leading to mass casualties, especially from hospital patients. The French Embassy eventually surrendered its refugees to prevent a massacre. Already mass executions of former military and civilian leaders are taking place in the Olympic Stadium. Cambodia is now firmly under Khmer Rouge rule."
 CAM_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The last bastion of Khmer Rouge fighters recently collapsed to the Cambodian government. Despite a vicious struggle, the government managed to frustrate Khmer Rouge attempts to intercept supply lines and isolate government centers from one another. With the Khmer Rouge unable to divide the military or consolidate control over population centers, the rebels eventually began losing more men than they could recruit from a peasantry. Cambodian peasants have grown increasingly frustrated by the disruptions caused by the war. With Khmer Rouge bands isolated and cutoff from the population, the government was able to mop up their remaining bands. During this final assault, many senior Khmer Rouge leaders and commanders were killed or captured. It is yet unknown if their leader Pol Pot is among them, though the government is confident any surviving leaders will be eventually taken care of."

 CAM_insurgency_options.0.d:0 "The Cambodian ruler, Prince Sihanouk, recently accepted an anti-communist government under Prime Minister Lon Nol. To fix the economy, Lon Nol initiated an aggressive rice harvesting campaign where heavily armed troops marched into the countryside, forcibly collecting rice and paying peasants low rates. This provoked an uprising which Lon Nol violently suppressed. This uprising pushed Prince Sihanouk to finally turn against the leftists as he ordered his own crackdown. However, these actions have provoked the communist Khmer Rouge party to launch an insurgency against the government. They plan on using support from neighboring communist parties and experience from Vietnam to guide their forces against a Cambodian government bent on breaking the leftist resistance once and for all."
 CAM_insurgency_options.100.d:0 "The Cambodian government had tried for years to balance its international relations with the West and communist states. Domestically it operated similarly, at times favor communist factions while at other times favoring anti-communists to maintain stability. However, following a peasant rebellion over rice taxes, the government took a strong turn against the communists and began allying with the United States. This provoked the communist Khmer Rouge to launch its communist rebellion against the government. Now the Cambodian government faces communist guerrillas who can call on the support of powerful regional communist governments."

 cam.1.d:0 "During the early year of 1949, King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, traveled to Paris in order to negotiate with the French government for more autonomy in Cambodia; which was granted and the nation was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and to a lesser extent, its defense. It did not take long, however, as the King was away, for squabbling and dissent to brew and Penn Nouth, the Cambodian Prime Minister, was being criticized and attacked for his failures to deal with financial and corruption problems. The dissenting legislators soon deposed Penn Nouth, but his successor did not sit well with the Democrat party, who asked the King to dissolve the assembly and hold elections. The King abided by this request and dissolved the assembly, ruling by decree for the next two years."
