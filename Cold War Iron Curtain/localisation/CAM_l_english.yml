 cam.1.d:0 "During the early year of 1949, King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, traveled to Paris in order to negotiate with the French government for more autonomy in Cambodia; which was granted and the nation was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and to a lesser extent, its defense. It did not take long, however, as the King was away, for squabbling and dissent to brew and Penn Nouth, the Cambodian Prime Minister, was being criticized and attacked for his failures to deal with financial and corruption problems. The dissenting legislators soon deposed Penn Nouth, but his successor did not sit well with the Democrat party, who asked the King to dissolve the assembly and hold elections. The King abided by this request and dissolved the assembly, ruling by decree for the next two years."
