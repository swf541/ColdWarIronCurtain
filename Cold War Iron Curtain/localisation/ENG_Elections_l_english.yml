 CWelect.1.t:0 "Election of 1950 - Clement Attlee v. Winston Churchill"
 CWelect.1.d:0 "The election of 1945, with the fall of Hitler's European Reich, set many precedents. Labour secured a large majority of Churchill-aligned Conservatives and the Liberal Party was shrunk to a mere third party and this situation carried us to this day. But that was 1945, it is now 1950 and the parties have changed. Labour has nationalized key industries and created the NHS, while the Conservatives are still led by Winston Churchill.

After years in Parliament and many cabinet positions, he was chosen in 1940 to replace Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, and his charisma and countless speeches got the British people through the war and all it curtailed. Winston Churchill and his career is much more defined by the Second World War than anything else, and that may be a good thing."

 Alec_Douglas-Home:0 "Coming as an MP from the House of Lords as the Baron of the Hirsel, Alec took over after the resignation of Harold MacMillan.
