 iree.1.d:0 "The general elections are here. This election is the first election since the declaration of the Republic of Ireland on 18 April 1949 under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which automatically forced Ireland's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth. The general election of 1951 is caused by a number of crises within the First Inter-Party Government, most notably the Mother and Child Scheme. There are of course other problems facing the country, such as rising prices and balance-of-payments problems. Two farmer TDs withdrew their support for the government because of rising milk prices. With the ballots closed and votes counted, the people eagerly await the results."
