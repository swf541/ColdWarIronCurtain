 cw_stalinotes.1.t:0 "Stalin Note from USSR"
 cw_stalinotes.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has sent us a treaty to us. They said that West and East Germany will unite into one neutral country if we accept. The neutral Germany will also have no alliances. This will most likely not last long. The neutral Germany will also be able to form an army. Now this will help the Soviets in protection because this neutral Germany will be a buffer zone for them. Though some of our advisors say that this will help stop a war hopefully breaking out in Germany. What do we say to the Soviets?"
 cw_stalinotes.1.a:0 "This sounds like a good deal. Notify the Germans."
 cw_stalinotes.1.b:0 "No, this helps the Reds more than us."
 
 cw_stalinotes.2.t:0 "NATO says no to Stalin Note"
 cw_stalinotes.2.d:0 "The Americans and NATO have said no to the Stalin Note. They said it will aid us more than them. A neutral Germany will protect us more. Should we offer a revised Stalin Note, or remove the Note?"
 cw_stalinotes.2.a:0 "Send a revised Note to NATO."
 cw_stalinotes.2.b:0 "Remove the Note. We will not budge on this. Germany will just have to stay divided."
 cw_stalinotes.2.c:0 "A bit of military pressure will surely get them to change their mind."
 
 cw_stalinotes.3.t:0 "Second Stalin Note"
 cw_stalinotes.3.d:0 "The USSR has sent us a second and revised Stalin Note. They said that there can be free elections and are sort of open to the Oder-Niesse Line going to Germany, but at a price of a limited army then. What do we say about this Note now?"
 cw_stalinotes.3.a:0 "The deal is fine with us."
 cw_stalinotes.3.b:0 "This deal is still unfair."
 
 cw_stalinotes.4.t:0 "Second Stalin Note Denied by NATO"
 cw_stalinotes.4.d:0 "NATO has said no to the Stalin Note again. We are running out of options, and they keep wanting the same things. They want the Oder-Niesse Line for the Germany without any backlash. They also want a full military for the neutral Germany. We however could try a military option to force them to come to the table. The Stalin Note has also been sort of a failure and we could call it off before it gets worse."
 cw_stalinotes.4.a:0 "Send a final Stalin Note."
 cw_stalinotes.4.b:0 "Call off the Stalin Note."
 cw_stalinotes.4.c:0 "A bit of military pressure will surely get them to change their mind."
 
 cw_stalinotes.5.t:0 "Final Stalin Note"
 cw_stalinotes.5.d:0 "The USSR has sent us a final Stalin Note. It includes everything from before that we disagreed on. They said that they are open to giving back the 1937 borders to the neutral Germany, but the rest stays the same. They said that if we say no, they will not answer anymore. Is this a deal maker for us? What do we do?"
 cw_stalinotes.5.a:0 "We agree on the 1937 border."
 cw_stalinotes.5.b:0 "The answer is still no."
 
 cw_stalinotes.6.t:0 "Stalin Note Agreed by NATO"
 cw_stalinotes.6.d:0 "NATO and the USSR have agreed on a treaty called the Stalin Note. The treaty states that the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will be unified under a neutral German state. We will be permitted to have an army, but we will not be able to join any alliances. We will also have free elections. Our border will still be the same. Do we accept the Stalin Note or not?"
 cw_stalinotes.6.a:0 "We accept this treaty of unification. One Germany for all Germans."
 cw_stalinotes.6.b:0 "We will negotiate for a better treaty. Send a negotiator to the USSR."
 cw_stalinotes.6.c:0 "We need to affirm ourselves in the West. This treaty will not work, and will take too much time."
 
 cw_stalinotes.7.t:0 "Stalin Note Grants Unification!"
 cw_stalinotes.7.d:0 "Both West and East Germany have agreed to a unified German state. In the Stalin Note it says that Germany will be unified, have free elections that are monitored, a standing army, the border being the same, and no alliances. NATO and the Warsaw Pact both agreed on this treaty together. The German people have been seen cheering about a unified German state. This will hopefully start a era of peace in our time."
 cw_stalinotes.7.a:0 "Ein Deutschland für eine"
 
 cw_stalinotes.8.t:0 "Stalin Note Talks"
 cw_stalinotes.8.d:0 "The FRG has sent a diplomat to discuss the Stalin Note. They wish to request the Oder-Neisse Line be annexed back to Germany under the 1937 border. They also are pushing for alliance system that they can choose, and free elections. Should we accept both of them, accept one or the other, or deny all requests?"
 cw_stalinotes.8.a:0 "We will grant the 1937 German border and the alliance system."
 cw_stalinotes.8.b:0 "Give 1937 borders in exchange for a neutral Germany."
 cw_stalinotes.8.c:0 "We will accept none of these. The Stalin Note will not change."
 
 cw_stalinotes.9.t:0 "Soviet Troops Deployed"
 cw_stalinotes.9.d:0 "We have seen increased Soviet chatter on their radio channels and movement of Soviet equipment and troops in East Germany. Our spy planes and spies have now confirmed this. Soviet troops have been seen on the West German border looking like they are going to attack. Even Checkpoint Charlie has Soviet tanks right across from our soldiers. They are obviously doing this because of us denying the Stalin Notes. Do we deploy our troops or ignore it? What do we do?"
 cw_stalinotes.9.a:0 "Deploy our troops and equipment."
 cw_stalinotes.9.b:0 "Ignore the Soviets."
 
 cw_stalinotes.10.t:0 "American Troops"
 cw_stalinotes.10.d:0 "The Americans have now deployed their equipment and soldiers. It seems we have their attention now. Now we can tell them what we want. We could send the final Stain Note, but then again some of the advisors say that if NATO said no the first two, then there is no point. If we send the final Stalin Note, no matter what their answer is we will not send another Note. What should we do?"
 cw_stalinotes.10.a:0 "Send a final Stalin Note"
 cw_stalinotes.10.b:0 "Cease all operations. The Note has been a failure"
 cw_stalinotes.10.c:0 "A coup in West Germany would help the cause."
 cw_stalinotes.10.dd:0 "All options won't work. Blood and sacrifice must be made."
 
cw_stalinotes.11.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Stalin Note Grants Unification!"
 cw_stalinotes.11.desc:0 "Both West and East Germany have agreed to a unified German state.

 cw_stalinotes.11.b:0 "Ein Deutschland für eine."
 cw_stalinotes.11.c:0 "It was time for a unified Germany."
 cw_stalinotes.11.d:0 "This neutral buffer state will greatly aid us."
 
cw_stalinotes.12.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Standoff in Germany!"
 cw_stalinotes.12.d:0 "The Soviet and American troops are in a standoff in Germany. What started with the Soviets deploying new military equipment and troops in East Germany, the Americans have followed suit. Even at Checkpoint Charlie in West Berlin has Soviet and American tanks and soldiers facing each other. The Soviets have said that this is a example of how war can break out in Germany because of a divided Germany and this is why the Stalin Note needs to be signed to save the World from destruction."
 cw_stalinotes.12.a:0 "Will World War III break out?"
 cw_stalinotes.12.b:0 "We will not back down."
 cw_stalinotes.12.c:0 "The Americans are playing with fire."
 
cw_stalinotes.13.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Standoff Ends in Germany!"
 cw_stalinotes.13.d:0 "After a tense few days, American and Soviet troops have pulled back from the borders. The Soviet Union has stated that there is no point in escalating the situation because NATO won't accept the Stalin Note. The Soviet Union also said that the World's future just got dimmer due to no peace treaty signed for a unified Germany. The Stalin Note Crisis seems to be coming to an end."
 cw_stalinotes.13.a:0 "Will they ever get along?"
 cw_stalinotes.13.b:0 "We knew they would back down."
 cw_stalinotes.13.c:0 "World War III isn't worth it. We will try again another time."
 
cw_stalinotes.14.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]War Breaks out in Germany!"
 cw_stalinotes.14.d:0 "War has broken out in Germany after Soviet and NATO forces exchanged gunfire in Berlin. We don't know who fired first, but forces along the German border are now at war. Soviet tanks and mechanized infantry have been seen speeding through the Fulda Gap, meanwhile NATO forces have hold Soviet advances in Southern Germany. It is World War III. Will this war be a conventional war or a nuclear war? "
 cw_stalinotes.14.a:0 "God help us."
 cw_stalinotes.14.b:0 "We will defend West Germany!"
 cw_stalinotes.14.c:0 "We will liberate the West!"
 
cw_stalinotes.15.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Neutral Germany united under 1937 border!"
 cw_stalinotes.15.desc:0 "The USSR and the DDR have agreed with the FRG and NATO on a unified neutral German state. Germany will have access to be members for any alliances. The 1937 border that Germany used to own is now given back to Germany. Poland has been down talking the removal of the Oder-Niesse Line from them and to Germany. Hopefully this ushers in a new era of peace in Europe."
 cw_stalinotes.15.a:0 "Peace in our time."
 cw_stalinotes.15.b:0 "We are finally unified."
 cw_stalinotes.15.c:0 "This is a great victory for peace."
 cw_stalinotes.15.d:0 "This is a great victory for peace."
 
cw_stalinotes.16.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]End of the Stalin Note"
 cw_stalinotes.16.d:0 "The USSR has stated that there will be no more Stalin Notes. They said that have recognized that NATO doesn't want a united Germany and has doomed the future of the world due to a war possibly breaking out in the German region because a divided Germany. The USSR also said that they were open to several ways to make a peaceful resolution for a united Germany, but NATO just didn't want it. NATO has stated that the Notes that were sent were unfair to NATO and one sided for the USSR. They also said that the Oder-Niesse Line wasn't agreed on due to NATO saying that the Line was a temporary border and would be given back to Germany, but the USSR hasn't done it. It seems this crisis has ended. "
 cw_stalinotes.16.a:0 "Will another crisis happen?"
 cw_stalinotes.16.b:0 "The Note was unfair"
 cw_stalinotes.16.c:0 "We offered NATO a olive branch and they said no."
 
cw_stalinotes.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Civil War in Germany!"
 cw_stalinotes.17.d:0 "A civil war has broken out in West Germany. The Neutral Rebels have said that West Germany must break off of Westernization and focus on the internal issues. They support the neutral unified Germany and want West Germany to accept the Stalin Note. NATO has said that this has to do something with the USSR supporting the rebels, but they don't have the proof. The Neutral Rebels have taken a few cities and blockaded any NATO forces from entering. NATO has said that combat operations will begin in West Germany and that they will help West Germany put down the rebellion."
 cw_stalinotes.17.a:0 "Who will win the Civil War? "
 cw_stalinotes.17.b:0 "We will help West Germany in anyway."
 cw_stalinotes.17.c:0 "Our plan is working."
