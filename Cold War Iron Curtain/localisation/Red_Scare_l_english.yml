 Red_Scare.1.d:0 "In an explosive speech given in West Virginia during Lincoln Day, Senator Joseph McCarthy waved a piece of paper on which, he claimed, was a list of 205 State Department workers suspected of being communists. He noted that despite being identified communist sympathizers, they remained in their positions and are shaping American foreign policy. He called for the federal government to stiffen its resolve and remove all communist sympathizers from federal agencies. The speech has resulted in a lot of public attention and McCarthy is now being seen as among the leading anti-communist crusaders in the Senate."
 Red_Scare.2.d:0 "The United States Senate has created the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to investigate the enforcement of the Internal Security Act and other laws related to espionage, infiltration, and sabotage against the United States of America. The committee is being led by Senator Patrick McCarran. The committee is expected to play a major role in uncovering communist threats to the United States. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the firebrand anti-communist crusader, is not on the committee. Many insiders note the Republican Party leadership is cautious of McCarthy and his aggressive accusations, which is why they ensured he would not be on the committee."
 Red_Scare.3.d:0 "The powerful veterans group, the American Legion, declared its supported all investigations into potential communist sympathizers and Soviet spies on US soil. The group notes that communism is the antithesis of American democracy and liberty. Thousands of American soldiers have given their lives to defend these ideas and millions have served to preserve it. Out of respect for those sacrifices, it is the duty of the American government to fully investigate and destroy these threats to the United States. With this endorsement by the influential group, politicians on both sides of the aisle will be openly supporting the investigations to not lose the vote of veterans who constitute a large voting block across the country."
 Red_Scare.4.d:0 "A Grand Jury has indicted both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage and betraying the United States. The couple are both already in custody after Julius was arrested several months ago following an FBI investigation that identified him as a Soviet spy. A Grand Jury was then setup and during those proceedings, Ethel Rosenberg as also arrested after she testified. The husband and wife will soon be brought to trial as the government accuses both of leading a powerful spy ring that gave American nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union during the war. Julius Rosenberg, who worked for the Army during the war, is accused of recruiting agents from the top-secret Manhattan Project and providing invaluable information to the Soviet Union. Ethel Rosenburg is accused of assisting her husband in these efforts."
 Red_Scare.5.d:0 "The trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg opened in New York. The trial is expected to feature the testimony of David Greenglass, who during his own interrogation admitted to giving information to Soviet agents through Julius Rosenberg. The Rosenbergs were only discovered for their alleged wartime espionage following the recent confession of a Manhattan Project scientist. Julius and Ethel are accused of organizing a powerful Soviet spy ring that helped the Soviets quickly end the American nuclear monopoly. The public is said to be outraged at how easily the Soviets appeared to infiltrate the most secret wartime operation and senior officials accuse these spies of enabling the Soviets to rapidly catch up to the United States in nuclear technology. The Rosenbergs defiantly deny the accusations and are expected to plead the fifth amendment at trial."
 Red_Scare.6.d:0 "The jury at the closely followed espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg found both guilty of murder. The judge in the case has decided to sentence both to death. In his comments, the judge noted that the two had not just committed espionage, but also enabled the Soviet Union to gain a technology that has emboldened communism across the globe, providing it a check to American nuclear power. He stated any American deaths in the post-war turbulence can be blamed on the Rosenburgs and akin to murder and for that also they must be punished. Julius Rosenberg in his own statement, called the trial a sham and claimed he was being setup for political gain. The American people have followed the case closely and are said to be stunned at the extent and ability of Soviet espionage."
 Red_Scare.7.d:0 "Most Americans wholeheartedly support the death sentence verdict given to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their involvement in sharing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. However, there is a growing movement calling for clemency for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The campaign is bringing not just communist leaning individuals but also those opposed to the death penalty and humanists. The Pope is also said to be in favor of commuting the sentence and passed his concerns to the President. The campaign has attracted several high profile, international scientists and Nobel Prize winners. The President must decide whether to deny the appeal for clemency or commute the sentences. To commute the sentence would improve the international image of the United States, however, it will lead to public backlash at home."
 Red_Scare.8.d:0 "The decision by the President to commute the sentence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to life in prison without parole received widespread international praise. However, the press in the United States has eviscerated the President. In addition, there are large protests being held across the United States condemning the decision. Many accuse the President of kowtowing to foreigners and ignoring the wishes of the American people. Others accuse the President of being soft on communists and say the decision will embolden more communists and Soviet spy operations. American war veterans in particular are outraged, noting that the decision was a slap in the face for all Americans who made extreme sacrifices in the war. The President must hope he can recover some of the lost support from the electorate."
 Red_Scare.9.d:0 "At the notorious Sing Sing Prison in New York, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were both executed for their crimes against the United States. They were convicted of providing top secret nuclear information to the Soviet Union which accelerated their nuclear program. The bodies were then sent to Brooklyn for a funeral before they were laid to rest at Wellwood Cemetery. They leave behind two minor children. Hundreds attended the funeral service while crowds numbering in the thousands stood outside the cemetery. It is clear the two are being looked at as martyrs for a number of the attendees who see the execution as confirmation that the United States was slowly turning away from its liberal ideals and towards despotic rule. Most Americans however welcomed the news as justice served."
 Red_Scare.10.d:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy, seen by many in his party as an uncontrollable loose-cannon, continues to rise in popularity. Newspapers publish almost daily reports of his claims and accusations of communist infiltration across the government. Many in Congress are following his lead, hoping their own anti-communist rhetoric will gain them attention and votes. Across the United States many Americans are supporting his investigations and taking it further. They are pressuring for the removal of books, movies, or even officials suspected of sympathizing with communists. McCarthy continues to gain popularity and influence, with many dubbing his campaign against communism as McCarthyism."
 Red_Scare.11.d:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy announced to the media his intentions to investigate an Army Signal Corps laboratory in New Jersey. The controversial senator alleges there is a spy ring of scientists within the lab and the Army has failed to properly deal with the situation. After several weeks, McCarthy conceded that there was no evidence of any communist spy rings at the lab. The Army is said to be furious with the accusations by McCarthy. Senator McCarthy however, recently received reports of a Major in the Army Major who was discovered to be a member of a dangerous leftist party but has not been removed from the service. Some allies of McCarthy are urging him to stop his investigation of the Army and shift to the State Department, but the senator appears focused on proving the military wrong."
 Red_Scare.12.d:0 "Senator McCarthy has started to ask questions of the Army over the case of Major Irving Peress. McCarthy notes that the Army dentist had been discovered to be a former member of the American Labor Party. He also left the section on political affiliations blank in the loyalty form. McCarthy wanted to know why it then took the Army ninety days to remove the Major from the service. Major Peress was granted an honorable separation by his commanding officer. The Army argues it conducted its investigation and process according to procedure, but McCarthy declared "who promoted Peress?" This quote has become a rallying cry for anti-communists and McCarthy's supporters across the nation. The Army is said to be seething."
 Red_Scare.13.d:0 "The Army recently accused Senator Joseph McCarthy and his chief counsel Roy Cohn of using his position to gain favorable treatment for a former aide who is currently serving as a private. McCarthy condemned the accusations and the incident will be investigated by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The hearings will be broadcast on national television and are expected to last for over a month. McCarthy is confident the hearings will exonerate him, while the Army plans on using information from a lawyer familiar with McCarthy to plan its own strategy. McCarthy must plan his approach carefully."
 Red_Scare.14.d:0 "Joseph Nyle Welch, the main attorney for the Army, got into a major spat with Senator Joseph McCarthy during hearings currently being held. Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide the list of 130 names of communists or subversives within the defense apparatus that McCarthy claims to have. Senator McCarthy responded by saying Welch should instead look into his own law firm as Fred Fisher belonged to a progressive lawyer association. Welch provided a strong defense of Fisher, in the end of his passionate response, he said, "Let us not assassinate this man further, Senator. You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?" at which the gallery thundered in applause. This emphasizes that the public exposure has opened McCarthy to criticism of being a bully and negative publicity."
 Red_Scare.15.d:0 "The Army-McCarthy hearings ended with neither side achieving a victory. The Army was able to prove Roy Cohn had interfered in Army affairs, but Senator McCarthy was exonerated. The Army Secretary was found to have interfered in the recent investigation of the Army Signal Corps Laboratory in New Jersey. However, the publicity of the hearings and media coverage has presented the public of a very unpleasant image of Senator McCarthy. Many now see him as a bully and spinner of lies. The reputation of the Senator and his supporters are at an all-time low."
 Red_Scare.16.d:0 "The Army-McCarthy hearings ended with neither side achieving a victory. The Army was able to prove Roy Cohn had interfered in Army affairs, but Senator McCarthy was exonerated. The Army Secretary was found to have interfered in the recent investigation of the Army Signal Corps Laboratory in New Jersey. Many observers were struck by how controlled and at times quiet McCarthy appeared during the proceedings. It appears the counsels of the Army were a bit surprised and had hoped to provoke some outbursts from the Senator. The media coverage was quite extensive but did not meaningfully change the opinion of the public that the pursuit of communists must continue."
 Red_Scare.17.d:0 "Senator McCarthy recently held hearings calling into the question the loyalty of senior officers in the Army. The Senator noted that suspected communists and subversives were able to pass loyalty-review reports. He questioned why certain officers were dragging their feet or grumbling over procedures meant to defend the United States from internal threats. His comments have gained traction among the American people but also among people in the Pentagon. Some senior defense officials privately worry that as these comments will lead to tensions within the military as officers start to suspect each other."
 Red_Scare.18.d:0 "The Senate recently voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. He is accused of bullying tactics not befitting a senator and of twisting the truth for his personal political benefit. The vote comes following his failed appearances at the Army-McCarthy Hearings. This combined with his other failed investigations and incendiary accusations have caused both his political and public allies to distance themselves from him. The fact that many of his fellow Republicans supported the vote shows a bipartisan rejection of the senator."
 Red_Scare.19.d:0 "The recent senate censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy has followed a much wider public backlash against the senator and McCarthyism. Many editorials now criticize the senator for whipping up public emotions and fear in order to gain attention. He is also accused of trying to start public witch hunts that run counter to American values. Many of his political opponents are also calling McCarthy out for ruining the image and career of countless people in the country. This  signals that the era of anti-communist McCarthyism maybe coming to a close."
 Red_Scare.20.d:0 "Senator McCarthy recently launched a series of investigations against the State Department. The Senator claimed hundreds of communists and subversives are shaping foreign policy. The State Department representatives denied the accusations, however, the public at times appeared captivated by the claims. In the end, a number of State Department officials either resigned or quietly retired to avoid the scrutiny and embarrassment. It appears McCarthyism is continuing strong and McCarthy remains on top."
 Red_Scare.21.d:0 "The American people were stunned to hear news that Senator Joseph McCarthy passed away, apparently from acute hepatitis. The late Senator passed away at Bethesda Naval Hospital. For years McCarthy was the face of congressional investigations into communist infiltration and spy rings within the federal government and military. McCarthy became the namesake of McCarthyism and despite his passing, the public interest and concern of communism in the United States continues. Many leading American politicians and figures have released statements expressing their admiration for the late senator."
 Red_Scare.22.d:0 "In recent weeks, the military has seen a spat of resignations following hearings held into the loyalty of officers. It appears many in the military, fearing a deeper investigation would affect morale and organization, chose to resign instead of dragging the process out. Several senior generals and admirals have resigned or taken an early retirement. The Pentagon also announced new directives to more streamline investigations and the process of removing subversives from the ranks. The loyalty-review reports are also being updated to be more efficient. Many retired officers have condemned the political interference in the military and fear it would take time for the military to restore its efficiency as a fighting force."
 Red_Scare.23.d:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy passed away, from acute hepatitis at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Some reporters are suggesting it may have been from alcoholism but this has not been confirmed. Senator McCarthy had been the face of congressional investigations into communist and subversive influences in the federal government. He initially captured the public attention as many Americans were concerned following the revelation of extensive Soviet spy rings which existed during World War II. However, he recently was censured by the senate for his aggressive questioning during hearings and the many baseless accusation he made. Public opinion had also declined significantly. Many believe the popularity of McCarthyism will end with his death."

 Red_Scare_Cul.1.d:0 "There is renewed focus on the United States judiciary following the deaths of Justices Frank Murphy and Wiley Rutledge, only months from each other. The two vacancies must be filled by the President and political observers across the country are awaiting his nomination. Some believe the President may chose two conservative jurists. Doing so would help the government in cases targeting dangerous dissidents or threats to national security. Others suggest the smart move may be appointing liberal judges to aid future efforts to protect civil liberties and civil rights."
 Red_Scare_Cul.2.d:0 "The so-called Hollywood Ten saw their conviction for contempt of congress upheld in the Supreme Court. The court refused to pick up their case, confirming the conviction. All ten former Hollywood writers and directors will soon be expected to pay a fine and serve a sentence of one year in prison. The conviction came after the accused failed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee to allegations that they were members of the Communist Party. The accused did attempt to read statements condemning the committee and its actions but were often cut off or treated with hostility by the congressmen. Hopes that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of the Hollywood Ten and its claims the convictions were a constitutional violation were denied by the court." 
 Red_Scare_Cul.3.d:0 "The Hollywood Ten begin their one-year prison sentences today. The group of former Hollywood directors and writers were convicted of contempt of congress for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee on allegations they were members of the Communist Party. The convicted men argued they did not have to answer the questions under the First Amendment and argued the committee itself was unconstitutional. However, their argument was not persuasive, and the Supreme Court ultimately chose not to review the case, upholding the convictions. Many liberal Americans believe this marks a defeat for individual rights in the country."
 Red_Scare_Cul.4.d:0 "In a surprise ruling, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the appeal of the so-called Hollywood Ten against their one-year prison sentence. The ten former directors and writers were convicted of contempt of congress for their refusal to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee. Many conservative newspapers are questioning the recent appointment of liberal justices to the courts and argue the review of the case does not bode well for future efforts by the government to uproot communism and dissent from the country. More liberal papers are championing the Supreme Court for listening to reason and checking the power of an increasingly out of control federal government."
 Red_Scare_Cul.5.d:0 "In an unprecedented move, the head of the House Un-American Activities Committee released a statement condemning the Supreme Court for hearing the appeal of the Hollywood Ten. The congressman noted such actions were clear judicial overreach and undermined efforts by congress and the government to deal with the threat of foreign communist influence in the country. Traitors, spies, and enemies of the United States should not be allowed to hide behind the courts and the freedoms guaranteed by the constitution in order to destroy the sacred republic."
 Red_Scare_Cul.6.d:0 "Director Edward Dmytryk, one of the convicted Hollywood Ten released a public statement from prision in which he condemned the Communist Party for using him and his fellow co-defendants as tools to further their agenda. Dmytryk had sought to escape prison by fleeing to England before he could be taken into custody, however, after his passport was expired he returned to the United States and arrested. He has vowed to finally appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee to set the record straight and name communists in Hollywood."
 Red_Scare_Cul.7.d:0 "Director Edward Dmytryk appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee to provide testimony on communists in Hollywood. The director had previously refused to testify and had been arrested for one year as a result. He now claimed the communists used him for its own propaganda purposes and now he was gladly testifying. During his electric testimony, Dmytryk admitted to briefly joining the Communist Party in 1945 and went on to list 21 communists, including seven directors. Dmytryk revealed the discovery of communist spy cells in the federal government and international communist aggression were also major factors in his decision to testify."
 Red_Scare_Cul.8.d:0 "Just two years after testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee, former Hollywood Ten member Edward Dmytryk is seeing a resurgence to his career as a director. Since testifying, he has directed a number of films, including one with rising Hollywood actor Kirk Douglas. There are rumors he may soon be picked to direct an upcoming film starring Humphrey Bogart that observers believe maybe a big hit during Oscar season. It appears his repentance and condemnation of communism was the key as all the other Hollywood Ten members continue to be blacklisted across the film industry. Hollywood insiders believe the studios fear a public backlash if they were to hire men seen as communist sympathizers."
 Red_Scare_Cul.9.d:0 "11 leaders of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) were indicted under the 1940 Smith Act for conspiring to overthrow the government. The arrests follow recent public trials of Soviet spies and congressional hearings on communist infiltrators across American society. The FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover was said to be instrumental in collecting evidence for this case. Leaks to the media suggest the FBI used informants and other intelligence tools to complete its investigation. All those arrested are members of the National Board for the CPUSA. A source within the investigative team suggests the figure of those charged may increase to over a hundred. The news has shocked the public, especially after hearing the CPUSA was said to have 80,000 members during the war."
 Red_Scare_Cul.10.d:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders intensified with the five defense attorneys questioning the purpose of the trial and failure of the court to secure an unbiased jury or maintain order. This is in reference to what many reporters are calling a carnival like atmosphere as the court remains packed with reporters and onlookers, many hurling insults at the defendants and their lawyers. The accused CPUSA leaders are being defended by five volunteer lawyers who argue the case is against basic principles of free speech and human rights. The prosecution alleges the defendants actively worked with the Soviet Union and had been plotting an armed revolution against the United States since 1945. Newspapers and editorials are largely supporting the prosecution."
 Red_Scare_Cul.11.d:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders continues to face criticism from free speech advocates and civil rights leaders who note how news of other convictions of Soviet spies are being widely shared in the courtroom. Recent convictions in these cases, which are not connected to the current trial, have fed public anxiety about communist infiltration. The CPUSA leader's defense attorneys speculate that these cases are being used by the prosecution to drum up fear in the Jury. Between this, and the massive amount of reports and spectators present, how could the jury not be influenced?"
 Red_Scare_Cul.12.d:0 "For the second time during the trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders, the judge declared all five defense attorneys will be held for contempt of court and punished at the conclusion of the trial. This comes after the defense once again question the validity and legitimacy of the proceedings, noting issues with the jury selection process and the at times disruptive atmosphere of the spectators watching. The judge has continuously denied these claims and accuses the defense of making a mockery of the court and launching delaying tactics. Some prominent lawyers have voiced concern over the actions of the judge."
 Red_Scare_Cul.13.d:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders ended with the jury finding all defendants guilty. Ten of those convicted were fined and sentenced to five years in prison. The eleventh, World War II veteran Robert Thompson, was given three years out of consideration for his wartime service. The judge then sentenced all five defense attorneys for contempt of court, giving them sentences ranging from one month to six months in prison. The public largely supporters the convictions, however, legal observers were disappointed by the sentencing, which they say showed a judge showing a vindictive character to the defense lawyers. Some lawyers went as far to agree with the assertion by a defendant that the court as a kangaroo court. Regardless, the public appears to back the convictions as an example of justice being upheld."
 Red_Scare_Cul.14.d:0 "The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) declared it would appeal all the guilty verdicts from the recently concluded trial of party leaders. They were convicted of violating the Smith Act by calling for the overthrow of the American government. The CPUSA defense argued its members were simply expressing their First Amendment rights and claimed no one advocated a violent overthrow but a peaceful transition to socialism. The trial caught public imagination about foreign communist influence in the United States and public anger towards the CPUSA. The defense lawyers throughout the trial noted the hostile gallery and court proceedings, which greatly favored the prosecution. This enraged the judge who had the lawyers held for contempt and convicted them at the end of the trial. The CPUSA hopes the Supreme Court will look at their appeal."
 Red_Scare_Cul.15.d:0 "The Secretary General of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) Eugene Dennis had his conviction under the Smith Act upheld in a major ruling by the Supreme Court. The justices ruled Dennis did not have First Amendment protection if he exercised those rights to advocate for the overthrow of the government. The court decision is a major blow for those communist leaders convicted in the Smith Act trials of CPUSA leaders. Observers note the recent appointment of conservative judges to the bench likely tipped the courts in favor of the government."
 Red_Scare_Cul.16.d:0 "The Supreme Court has upheld the convictions of defense lawyers from the recent trials of Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) leaders for violating the Smith Act. The lawyers complained throughout the trial of unfair procedures and biases favoring the prosecution. They also noted the hostile gallery and negative press blanketing the nation. At the end of the trial, the judge ordered all the attorneys for the defense to be detained and sentenced them to various prison terms for being in contempt of court. Many believe the judge was so hostile as he felt the defense was deliberately trying to cause a mistrial. The Supreme Court chose to only focus on a small aspect of the contempt charge and declared the conviction was justified, upholding the convictions."
 Red_Scare_Cul.17.d:0 "In a shock decision, the Supreme Court overturned the convictions of defense lawyers from the recent trials of Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) leaders for violating the Smith Act. The trial judge convicted them after accusing them of deliberately trying to provoke the courtroom in order to get a mistrial. The Supreme Court justices noted the convictions appeared vindictive, especially when the judge was recording as saying "unfinished business" before handing out his convictions. The inability of the lawyers to defend themselves and their immediate arrest were also questioned by the justices. The public reaction is expected to be negative, with many blaming the President for bringing more liberal judges to the Supreme Court."
 Red_Scare_Cul.18.d:0 "The Supreme Court shocked the public by its decision to overturn the conviction of Eugene Dennis under the Smith Act. Dennis, the Secretary General of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) was convicted of advocating for the violent overthrow of the United States. The court ruled that Dennis had not violated the Act and his actions were all protected under the First Amendment of the constitution. In addition, the court did also note the conditions at the trial were not ideal or favorable to the defense, chastising the trial judge. The stunning decision will likely anger the government and also the general public which overwhelmingly supported the government and the convictions."
 Red_Scare_Cul.19.d:0 "Newspapers across the United States are criticizing the Supreme Court and its decision to overturn the conviction of Eugene Dennis, the Secretary General of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). He had been convicted under the Smith Act for inciting the violent overthrow of the United States government. The Supreme Court ruled Dennis had not violated the act and could not be convicted for exercising his First Amendment rights. The trial had captivated the country, especially New Yorkers who began to see the communist threat was not limited to foreign spies but other Americans as well. New Yorkers have staged protests as well. Many Americans believe the courts are too soft on enemies of the state who hide behind constitutional protections and believe the court has critically weakened the ability of the government to protect the nation."
 Red_Scare_Cul.20.d:0 "Following the controversial Supreme Court rulings, which many believe completely undermines the ability for the government to punish and arrest communist infiltrators, the fiery, anti-communist senator Joseph McCarthy called a press conference. In his comments, the senator condemned the Supreme Court, especially the two recently appointed judges who he suggests may have far left tendencies. He pointed out the court decisions appear contrary to the court other rulings handed down across the country and fears communism may be trying to infiltrate the judiciary. Senator McCarthy called on the House Un-American Activities Committee to investigate the justices and ensure there is no communist plot infecting the judiciary."
 Red_Scare_Cul.21.d:0 "The House Un-American Activities Committee in an unprecedented move demanded the two most recently appointed justices to the Supreme Court submit written answers to questions regarding recent cases involving the overturn of convicted communists. In addition there will be questions regarding the past political engagements and beliefs of the judges. The committee stated the answers would be read during an upcoming hearing on the justices and provide answers and hopefully relief to worried Americans uncomfortable with the recent actions of the court. A refusal to answer congress may result in a subpoena from congress, compelling them to attend the hearings."
 Red_Scare_Cul.22.d:0 "The House Un-American Activities Committee read the official reply from the two Supreme Court Justices to questions by the committee. The committee members, reporters, and observers were all stunned in silence. The justices systematically defended their actions and backgrounds. They also took the time to explain their actions to the American people as one built on preserving their individual rights and curtail government overreach in order. The eloquent responses will soon be published in national media. After reading the documents, several committee members offered their own blistering response but the HUAC decided to delay the next hearing on the justices till after the weekend. Observers believe the committee wishes to see the public reaction before deciding to continue the investigation."
 Red_Scare_Cul.23.d:0 "Public sentiment on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation of the two most recently appointed Supreme Court Justices has turned sour. The transcripts and editorials by newspaper editors reflect the general belief that many view the HUAC investigation as a political vendetta and an attempt to undermine the judiciary branch. Most Americans are unconvinced by the idea of the justices being secretly connected to the communist threat. With this backlash, the HUAC has decided to end its inquiry early and to focus on more pressing issues."
 Red_Scare_Cul.24.d:0 "Public reaction towards the House Un-American Activities Committee and its investigation of the two most recently appointed Supreme Court Justices greatly favors of the HUAC. Transcripts and editorials by newspaper editors reflect the belief of many, that the House's investigation is exposing a dangerous leftist bias within the highest court in the land. Many Americans believe the investigation of judges should be expanded to all courts in order to prevent a communist plan to avoid government prosecution. Supporters of the judiciary fear such reactions will only undermine the ability of judges to render fair rulings."
 Red_Scare_Cul.25.d:0 "The two Supreme Court justices undergoing investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee submitted their resignation today. The judges note they do not wish to be a distraction or even appear to sully the court; thus they will resign. In their statement, both judges emphasized they were not resigning out of guilt but out of a desire to protect the judiciary and its principles. The President is expected to replace the judges with more conservative ones as he will not want to see this scenario reoccur."
 Red_Scare_Cul.26.d:0 "In recent days, two new Supreme Court justices were sworn in. This came after the controversial resignation of two justices following their role in reversing several anti-communist convictions on constitutional grounds. This resulted in public and congressional backlash that saw the judges resign. The President, reading the mood of the country, quickly selected two new conservative judges with strong anti-communist biases to prevent any further judicial interventions in federal cases against communism."
 Red_Scare_Cul.27.d:0 "Two justices of the Supreme Court have testified in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), responding to the subpoena by the committee. Some Congressmen took the opportunity to blast the judges for their interference in recent court cases targeting communist threats to the United States. They also demanded the judges fully account for their past involvement or relationships with leftist individuals or organizations. However, the justices were skilled experts of the law and courtroom, they offered strong defenses and statements that often outmaneuvered their critics. Ultimately they claimed their recent rulings were not based on ideological balances, but on constitutional legitimacy and warned their rulings would help ensure no nefarious ideology could use the courts against the people of the United States. Although the justices defended themselves expertly in the hearings, it remains to be seen how the American public will react to the transcripts."
 Red_Scare_Cul.28.d:0 "The United States Supreme Court ruled to overturn the conviction of low-level communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act for being members of an organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government. In the landmark ruling, the court decided that the Smith Act's clause concerning actors advocating the violent overthrow of the US Government did not apply to those who only believed in a violent overthrow, but did not advocate for its occurrence. Thus,the court overturned the communist leader's convictions on the grounds that their First Amendment rights were violated. The reaction of congress, the White House, and security agencies is expected to be negative, but the court appears committed to not let public fervor dictate judicial norms."
 Red_Scare_Cul.29.d:0 "The United States Supreme Court ruled to uphold the convictions of low-level communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act. The court concurred with the initial ruling that the Smith Act does not violate the First Amendment and those convicted were involved in an organization that believed in the violent overthrow of the government. The dissenting opinion argued the court had not considered the difference between belief and actual advocacy of overthrow, nothing the ruling today left many innocent Americans vulnerable. Regardless, the court decision is being praised on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and among security agencies who believe the court must continue to support efforts at protecting the United States. Some newspaper editorials criticized the courts and claimed recent public backlash and appointments have cost the court any semblance of judicial independence."
 Red_Scare_Cul.30.d:0 "The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the convictions against the so-called Hollywood Ten. These writers and directors were charged for refusing to appear before the House Committee of Un-American Activity to name communists in the film industry. The new progressive judges on the bench shifted the vote to overturn the convictions. The decision is being widely criticized by conservative newspapers and congressmen who accuse the court of interfering in the protection of the national security of the United States. The Supreme Court ruled the convictions and prison terms were unconstitutional and excessive. The court has taken a strong stance in defense of individual freedoms."
