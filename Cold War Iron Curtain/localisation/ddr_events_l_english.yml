 ddr.1.t:0 "Increased Work Quotas"
 ddr.1.d:0 "The heads of the state industrial sector have been pushing for increased work quotas for many months. Now they have finally got what they wanted, with the government issuing approval of their request. The people will be pushed harder to work for the state, but that shouldn't be a problem in any way."
 ddr.1.o1:0 "Great"
 ddr.2.t:0 "Uprising"
 ddr.2.d:0 "Yesterday morning 300 East Berlin construction workers went on strike and marched down Stalinallee towards government buildings after their superiors announced a pay cut if they did not meet the increased work quota. Their numbers quickly swelled and a general strike and protests were called for. Major clashes occured today, but finally the military put down the uprising with immense force."
 ddr.2.o1:0 "What else could we have done?"
ddr.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]DDR Established"
 ddr.3.d:0 "The Deutsche Demokratische Republik, otherwise known as East Germany, was founded in the Soviet occupied zone of Germany today. The establishment of the GDR seals the divison of Germany that happened in 1945. West Germany had already gained independence from the occupying powers earlier in 1949, and the creation of East Germany meant the same for the formerly Soviet-zone, although the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany maintained close ties with the USSR and was therefore seen as a satellite state."
 ddr.3.o1:0 "Auferstanden aus Ruinen!"
 ddr.3.o2:0 "There goes the unification"
 ddr.4.t:0 "Toeing the Line"
 ddr.4.d:0 "The new East German government is toeing the line of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet government. Perhaps we could reward them by sending back some industry we took during the occupation."
 ddr.4.o1:0 "Sure"
 ddr.4.o2:0 "We will keep it for our own purposes"
 ddr.5.t:0 "Soviets Send Back Industry"
 ddr.5.d:0 "The Soviet government has just announced that they will be returning significant amounts of industry, namely factories, to the DDR after they were taking in the Soviet occupation. This is most likely a reward for us maintaining our communist path."
 ddr.5.o1:0 "Excellent"
 ddr.6.t:0 "Soviets Refuse to Send Industry"
 ddr.6.d:0 "Many in the Russian government suggested to the top leadership that some industry should be returned to the DDR that was stolen during the occupation as a reward for toeing the line. However, their proposal has been rejected, and the industry will stay in the USSR."
 ddr.7.t:0 "East German Pressure"
 ddr.7.d:0 "A stunning reversal in the DDR's foreign policy has resulted in them making an interesting proposal. If we promise to side with them against Warsaw, they will occupy the Western lands that are supposedly rightfully German despite massive deportations in the immediate post-war years. As the puppet-master of the Eastern Bloc, we must choose who to support."
 ddr.7.o1:0 "Support the DDR"
 ddr.7.o2:0 "Support Poland and the Oder-Neisse"
 ddr.8.t:0 "USSR Supports Us"
 ddr.8.d:0 "The Soviet Union has declared that they will support us in our Polish expansion, at least behind closed doors."
 ddr.8.o1:0 "Wonderful"
 ddr.9.t:0 "Soviet Betrayal"
 ddr.9.d:0 "Behind closed doors, the government of the USSR has pledged their full support to the East Germans in their Eastern expansion. We could retaliate against the DDR's occupation but we would be at war with our puppet-master as well. We could simply accept our fate."
 ddr.9.o1:0 "Nothing can be done"
 ddr.9.o2:0 "Fight back!"
 ddr.10.t:0 "Soviets Support Us"
 ddr.10.d:0 "Behind closed doors, the government of the USSR has pledged their full support to Poland in the East German expansion attempts. The DDR attempted to ask the Soviets to take our Western lands, but thankfully Moscow realised the true nationalistic nature behind this."
 ddr.10.o1:0 "They saved Europe"
 ddr.11.t:0 "USSR Supports Poland"
 ddr.11.d:0 "Behind closed doors, the government of the USSR has pledged their full support to Poland in our expansion attempts. We asked for their Western lands from the Soviets, but unfortunately Moscow believes the Poles are better off in the Warsaw Pact than East Germany."
 ddr.11.o1:0 "What can one expect?"
 ddr.12.t:0 "Unification?"
 ddr.12.d:0 "For a considerable amount of time we have expected the East Germans to offer some kind of reunification proposal. Today we received a note from the DDR's ambassador detailing their request. They state that East Germany is in fact willing to dismantle the socialist system and reunify with the West, as long as we dismantle our treaties with NATO and become a neutral state."
 ddr.12.o1:0 "Accept"

 ddr.14.o1:0 "We have failed"
 ddr.15.t:0 "Berlin Wall Broken Down"
 ddr.15.d:0 "It was 8 at night and the people of West Berlin seemed to be going about their daily lives. However just half an hour later, revolution was in the air, and hundreds of thousands were marching towards the Berlin Wall. The guards could do nothing as West Berliners tore the structure down and ran into the territory of the DDR, begging to be rescued by socialism. Now today the population is demanding that the democratic government step down and make way for socialism and unification with the East."
 ddr.15.o1:0 "It is the people's will"
 ddr.16.t:0 "Berlin Wall Comes Down"
 ddr.16.d:0 "It was 8 at night and the people of West Berlin seemed to be going about their daily lives. However just half an hour later, revolution was in the air, and hundreds of thousands were marching towards the Berlin Wall. The guards could do nothing as West Berliners tore the structure down and ran into the territory of the DDR, begging to be rescued by socialism. Now today the population is demanding that the democratic government step down and make way for socialism and unification with the East."
 ddr.16.o1:0 "The time has come"
 ddr.17.t:0 "Unification?"
 ddr.17.d:0 "For a considerable amount of time we have expected the East Germans to offer some kind of reunification proposal. Today we received a note from the DDR's ambassador detailing their request. They state that East Germany is in fact willing to unify a country under two systems. The East would maintain the socialist government and economy, while the West would maintain democracy and capitalism. The two would have shared foreign policy and other systems however, which leads us to believe that they will be lenient."
 ddr.17.o1:0 "Accept"

 ddr.20.t:0 "Leadership Killed"
 ddr.20.d:0 "In a horrifying turn of events, the top leaders of the German Democratic Republic have been assassinated in a coordinated attack across the nation. The Chairman, his Deputies and all Ministers are dead, and the Volkskammer has declared itself the highest level of office as of this moment, rejecting the military's proposal of taking control."
 ddr.20.o1:0 "What will happen next?"
 ddr.21.t:0 "Nazi Coup"
 ddr.21.d:0 "Just a few hours ago senior leaders of the military stormed into the Volkskammer, arresting various politicians on the grounds of corruption. As they left, bombs rocked the nation, from East Berlin to Dresden, with key government installations attacked. The remaining members of the Volkskammer declared a state of emergency, but it was too late as the military announced their takeover of the administration effective immediately, under the pretense of German salvation. As far as we know, they claim to be the successors to the National Socialists."
 ddr.21.o1:0 "Heil!"
 ddr.22.t:0 "The Führer"
 ddr.22.d:0 "To unify the people of East Germany we must have a Führer to take charge and restore order completely. Who shall it be?"
 ddr.23.t:0 "Nazi Coup in Germany"
 ddr.23.d:0 "Just a few hours ago senior leaders of the East German military stormed into the Volkskammer, arresting various politicians on the grounds of corruption.

 ddr.24.t:0 "East Germany Demands West"
 ddr.24.d:0 "The restored Nazi administration in East Germany has demanded that we return the supposedly 'rightful lands' of Western Poland to Germany. How should we respond?"

 ddr.24.o3:0 "We will stand our ground"
 ddr.25.t:0 "Poland Offers Provinces"
 ddr.25.d:0 "The Polish have accepted some of our blunt demands by allowing us to take the regions of Eastmark and Pommerania without any trouble. However, is this enough for us?"

 ddr.26.t:0 "Poland Accepts"

 ddr.27.t:0 "Poland Refuses"
 ddr.27.d:0 "The Polish government has rejected all of our blunt demands by refusing to allow us to take the Western regions of their nation without any trouble. Should we enforce our demands with brute military power or back down?"

 ddr.31.t:0 "Unification?"
 ddr.31.d:0 "With both West Germany and East Germany being ruled by the benevolent leaders of Nazism, the East Berlin government has offered us a deal which would unify the nation after years of division. How should we respond?"

 ddr.34.t:0 "Berlin Spring"
 ddr.34.d:0 "It was a relatively cold and foggy morning in East Berlin, when shops were only just opening. However, a few hours later, an a wave of unarmed citizens marched to various government offices demanding the officials surrender to the revolution. As they did, another army of revolutionaries marched to the border with West Germany yelling to their counterparts to rush over and reunite. Reunite they did, as the people of East Berlin announced that the communist government had collapsed within a day, and that the Berlin Spring was successful in peacefully taking down an oppressive government."
 ddr.34.o1:0 "Their reign is over"
 ddr.35.t:0 "Berlin Spring"
 ddr.35.d:0 "The East Germans have turned to the horrors of democracy and capitalism, calling it the Berlin Spring. Should we invade and restore order?"

 ddr.42.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]The Berlin Wall"
 ddr.42.d:0 "The government of the DDR has began to build a barbed wire and concrete "Antifascistischer Schutzwall," or "antifascist bulwark," between East and West Berlin. The official purpose of this Berlin Wall has been told is to keep Western "fascists" from entering East Germany and undermining the socialist state, but some think it primarily serves the objective of stemming mass defections from East to West. The president of the USA said "a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.""
 ddr.42.a:0 "This signals an even deeper partition"
 ddr.43.d:0 "Friedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck has just died in his apartment at Majakowskiring 29, Pankow, East Berlin. In 1949, he became the first President of the German Democratic Republic, an office abolished upon his death."
 Honecker.100.d:0 "Erich Honecker has just been chosen as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party in German Democratic Republic. Honecker is a self-stated hardliner who on several occasions butted heads with the Soviets and as such, was seen as the best choice for GDR. During his inagratuion speech his staunch anti-liberal platform garnered much support from Cuba, North Korea, and countless hardline socialists worldwide. West Germany accused Honecker for committing atrocities by overseeing the construction and operation of the Berlin Wall."
 Prussia_cul.1.d:0 "Frederick the Great IS the greatest leader Germany ever had. He rose Prussia from nothing to a force to be reckoned with. It’s time we once again embrace his legacy. The DDR announced the establishment of a holiday in honor of Frederick the Great. The week of the holiday will feature daily military parades and festivals celebrating Prussia. Western European commentators are already calling it an Eastern Oktoberfest."
 Prussia_cul.2.d:0 "The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther enabled the people of Europe defy the Papacy and the Empire. In a way we owe Luther for the rise of Germany. Our Germany, not the lies of Habsburgs and Popes."
 Prussia_cul.5.d:0 "The East German morning began violently as radical supporters of the government’s anti-Lutheran policy set fire to several churches and reportedly assaulted multiple priests. The government has issued no comment but Lutherans around the world denounce these acts as brutality." 
 Prussia_Spring.5.d:0 "The East German regime announced today that the German Democratic Republic would be undertaking a radical shift of economic policy similar to that of Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia. This action is met with mixed feelings and general suspicion from the Soviet Union."
 Prussia_Spring.6.d:0 "Once more the Junkers and Hohenzollerns rise! Until the dying days of the Weltkrieg we held the world in fear. We failed then, we will not fail again. More than 30 years since the abdication of Wilhelm II the Hohenzollern dynasty has returned to Prussia and taken their place as monarchs of Prussia. Objections from the United Kingdom and France were issued the same day."
 Prussia_Spring.3.d:0 "When we lost the war, eastern Germany was enslaved by the Bolshevik menace. We suffered countless indignities inflicted by the Soviets. No more will we be their puppet. The newly reestablished Kingdom of Prussia announced that withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact was imminent. No mention was made of the other Soviet led organizations that Germany was a part of, but NATO experts predict that Prussia would leave them all."
 Prussia_Spring.4.d:0 "Soviet Revisionism is a pollutant to the ideas of Marx. Chairman Mao taught us much, and now we break our chains and rally the people. We will unite Germany as Mao freed China. In an unexpected turn of events the East German leadership denounced the Soviet leadership and threatened to withdraw from the Comecon. The German Ambassador recently took part in a high-profile diplomatic mission to China, and now the purpose was clear that Germany sought an alliance with Communist China."
 NDP.1.d:0 "Despite what the Allies said, we aren’t free. They manipulate our nation, steal our resources and our rightful land. Hitler stood against the west and now the next generation of Germans is ready to take their stand. Early this morning West German police were called once again to disperse a rally led by the Neo-Nazi NDP. The government and NATO both made statements that condemned the party and its actions, but it seems the police actions have been inefficient and polls for the upcoming elections predict the NDP gaining a handful of seats."
 NDP.2.d:0 "When Hitler led our Reich, our borders stretched from Spain to the gates of Moscow. Our army undefeated, our people overjoyed. Then at the peak of our power it fell apart. This time we right the wrongs and conquer the Bolsheviks. Today Germany saw itself united after a referendum that left most of the world stunned. Once more the fascists are in control of Germany. NATO has made no comment, but protest speeches have already begun at the United Nations with the Polish representative leading the protests likely on behalf of the Soviet Union."
 DDR_prussa_unify.1.d:0 "18, January 1871 in the halls of the Sun King, Germany was finally united. We usurped France as the masters of Europe, and now our Kaisers return. Our Reich will finally take its place in the sun. The Kingdom of Prussia once again became the catalyst for the unification of Germany under one leader after a lengthy campaign of reunification. After negotiations with the former West German Government the reunification was finalized at the Versailles Palace, though this time they only asked to book the venue rather than invade France."
 DDR_unify.1.d:0 "Germany has suffered endlessly since the end of the war. Us more than the West. Both our people clamor for the wall to come down and to join arms united again. After decades of separation the people of Berlin tore down the wall that had not only separated the people of Germany but killed those who had tried to cross it. The footage of the wall’s destruction was broadcast to millions across the world and is already being lauded as one of the most significant events of the century."
 ddr.46.d:0 "Great news have emerged from Saxony. VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau has just anmnounced that the first of Trabant P50 models have left the factory. It is relatively advanced car with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension.\nThe engine is a small, 500cc air cooled two-stroke making 18hp. This means the car can reach a max of 100 km/h.\nThe average wait time for the new car is 10 years, but under socialism we are in no hurry."
