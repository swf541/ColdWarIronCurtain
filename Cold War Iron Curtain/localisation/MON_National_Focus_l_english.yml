 mongolia.1.d:0 "Under the boot of Stalin and his Communist puppets in Mongolia, the people of the region have suffered greatly. Since its establishment in 1921, the Mongolian People’s Republic has been plagued with purges and massacres completely uprooting the Mongolian people’s way of life and having a devastating impact on the population. Despite claiming to represent the people, the Mongolian People’s Party has forced the people into collectivising their livestock while practically eradicated the Buddhist religion. Their desecrated temples remaining as a scorched reminders of lost times. Discontent with Soviet rule has been growing and the population has grown increasingly unhappy with Communist rule. Although not a threat to Soviet rule yet, the rising anti-Soviet sentiment throughout Mongolia is a danger Stalin cannot afford to ignore."
 mongolia.7.d:0 "Mongolia has had a complicated and unstable history since the fall of the Mongol Empire. In the mess of warlord-era Chinese politics, the small and isolated nation of Mongolia was forgotten by the great powers and thus never received any formal recognition. After Bogd Khan and the occupying Chinese forces were ousted by the Red Army in 1921, the country was effectively under Soviet control and lacked any official statehood. Despite independently taking part in the battles against Japan during World War 2, Mongolia’s independence was still only recognised by the Soviets. However, with the Cold War intensifying throughout the world, the Soviet Union has led to a considerable intensification in efforts to give the Mongols recognition as an independent state. This move represents a major step forward for the Mongolian national identity, and could possibly give Mongolia its status as a universally recognised power back for the first time since the 14th century."
 mongolia_prc_1_desc:0 "In a formal communique, the [PRC.GetName] has offered a few hundred thousand Han Chinese workers to Outer Mongolia in order to help with modernising our country. This would doubtlessly be incredibly useful in ensuring our role in the Communist world. However, the [MON.GetName] is a very small nation, relatively speaking, with not very many ethnic Mongolians living in our nation. If we accept these Han Chinese workers, we would have far more ethnic Chinese than we could possibly assimilate, and there is a potential that the [PRC.GetName] will attempt to integrate our nation."
 inner_mongol_13_desc:0 "Earlier today, the [PRC.GetName] announced they would be allowing and encouraging the migration of Mongolian people from the region of Inner Mongolia and into Outer Mongolia, or the [MON.GetName]. This is following an initial request for a ceding of the entire Inner Mongolia region, something apparently found ridiculous by the Chinese Government, which vehemently denied the request. However, their formal request for a migration treaty of sorts was accepted as an act of goodwill, and the movement towards Mongolian unity is celebrated in Ulaanbaatar tonight."
 inner_mongol_14_desc:0 "Earlier today, the [MON.GetName] has reported their displeasure with the Chinese government due to their aggressive refusal to work with the Mongolian government in their attempts to integrate the Inner Mongolian populations into their domain. Initially, [PRC.GetName] denied an initial attempt to organise a cession of the Inner Mongolian region into their state with the hope of better relations following the transference of the region. When the [MON.GetName] sent another communique requesting an open migration policy, the [PRC.GetName] further denied them. Tonight, many in Mongolia are left feeling frustrated at the lack of cooperation."
 inner_mongol_12_desc:0 "The damned [PRC.GetName] has further soiled our aims to unite the Mongols. Out of a misguided attempt at fighting us tooth and nail out of spite, they have denied both of our requests, instead favoring a staunch position of what almost seems like anti-Mongolian sentiment. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for our union."
 inner_mongol_11_desc:0 "Although the [PRC.GetName] refused our initial request for transference of Altaic lands, they have tentatively accepted the request for open migration of the peoples of Inner Mongolia into Outer Mongolia. This decision is not exactly what we wanted, but union of our people is nevertheless a good thing."
 inner_mongol_10_desc:0 "Although we rebuffed their earlier communique, we received yet another message from the Mongolian government. Apologising for their presumptiveness, [PRC.GetLeader] has requested a treaty for open migration for Altaic peoples into their land, furthering their mission of unity of their people. Though this is less of an annoyance than the previous request, some still hold issue with the idea of appeasing the Mongols."
 mongolia.2.d:0 "Our dear leader, Khorloogiin Choibalsan has died at the age of 56 from kidney cancer in Moscow. He will be remembered as a hero, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr for the cause of Mongolian independence. His body has been returned with full military honors and he was given a state funeral in the capital which was attended by Mongolian and Soviet officials alike. He was buried in Altan Ulgii cemetery in Ulaanbaatar, but work has begun on a mausoleum in front of the Government Palace."
 
 inner_mongol_1_desc:0 "Although Inner Mongolia has not been a part of the Mongolian nation since the fall of the empire of Temujin, the Altaic people still inhabit vast swathes of the steppes of inner Mongolia, now a part of Northern China. More so, a vocal population of this region desires a united steppe, and a Greater Mongolian sphere reunited at last. However, the [tag.china] controls these vast steppes, and may not see our point of view when it comes to our acquisition of their lands. We can only send our request, and hope for the best."
 inner_mongol_2_desc:0 "At noon today, we received a communique from [tag.mongolia]. Within the communique was a detailed request for the ceding of the territories of inner Mongolia to [tag.mongolia] in what [leader.mongolia] described as an “ancestral and ethnic right to unity of peoples”. While it is true that this would be a notable act of goodwill towards the Altaic peoples of the region, as well as something that would establish better relations between our countries, many vocal members of our government have responded to this request hostilely, stating in plain terms that we do not owe the Mongol people anything. "
 inner_mongol_3_desc:0 "China has denied our request in an unfortunate turn of events. [leader.china] has claimed that \"The Chinese people do not owe the Mongolians anything.\" refusing our attempt for a unity of peoples. However, we may be able to convince our neighbours to participate in an open migration treaty that would allow our brothers in the south to resettle in our lands."
 inner_mongol_4_desc:0 "China has accepted our request. In a few short words, [leader.china] effectively handed over Inner Mongolia, citing the animosity in the past and a hope for further friendship between the two nations. Although the transferance of land may take some time, this is a landmark achievement for diplomacy."
 inner_mongol.5.d:0 "Earlier today, the [PRC.GetName] proclaimed that it would be ceding the lands of Inner Mongolia to the [MON.GetName], citing the prolific Altaic peoples in the region, as well as a desire to better relations between the two nations. Although the lands have not been properly owned by a Mongolian state since the Yuan dynasty, the Mongolian government has claimed their desire for a union of Mongolian people. In Ulaanbaatar, the populace has taken to the streets in celebration of this crowning achievement of diplomacy."
