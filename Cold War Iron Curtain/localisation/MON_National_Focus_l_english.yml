 mongolia.1.d:0 "Under the boot of Stalin and his Communist puppets in Mongolia, the people of the region have suffered greatly. Since its establishment in 1921, the Mongolian People’s Republic has been plagued with purges and massacres completely uprooting the Mongolian people’s way of life and having a devastating impact on the population. Despite claiming to represent the people, the Mongolian People’s Party has forced the people into collectivising their livestock while practically eradicated the Buddhist religion. Their desecrated temples remaining as a scorched reminders of lost times. Discontent with Soviet rule has been growing and the population has grown increasingly unhappy with Communist rule. Although not a threat to Soviet rule yet, the rising anti-Soviet sentiment throughout Mongolia is a danger Stalin cannot afford to ignore."
 mongolia.7.d:0 "Following the collapse of the Mongol Empire, Mongolia has had a complicated and unstable history. Coming under the rule of the Qing Empire in the late 17th century, Mongolia remained subjugated until the overthrow of the Qing in the Xinhai revolution of 1911. In the mess of warlord-era Chinese politics, the small and isolated nation of Mongolia was forgotten by the great powers and thus never received any formal recognition of their independence. After Bogd Khan and the occupying Chinese forces were ousted by the Red Army in 1921, the country was effectively under Soviet control and lacked any official statehood, remaining as an effective puppet of the USSR. Despite independently taking part in the battles against Japan during World War 2, Mongolia’s independence was only recognised by the Soviets themselves in 1945. However, with the Cold War intensifying throughout the world, the Soviet Union has sought to reinforce any Communist nation, which has led to a considerable intensification in efforts to give the Mongols recognition as an independent state. This move represents a major step forward for the Mongolian national identity, and could possibly give Mongolia its status as a universally recognised power back for the first time since the 14th century."
