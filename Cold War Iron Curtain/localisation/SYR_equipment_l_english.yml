 SYR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The MAS-36 is a bolt-action rifle from France, adopted by her armed forces since 1936 and used during World War II. The rifles arrived in large numbers to Syria during World War II as the Allied forces secured the colony from the Vichy government. When the country was granted independence, France left thousands of the rifle for the new independent Syrian military."

 SYR_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK-47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK-47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK-47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world. "

 SYR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK-47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides. "

 SYR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK-74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK-74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK-74."

 SYR_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-74M is an improved variant of the AK-74 developed in 1991 by the Izhmash factory. The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."

Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east.

The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64.
