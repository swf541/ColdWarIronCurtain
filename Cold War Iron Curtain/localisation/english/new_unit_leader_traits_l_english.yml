The group, led by Park Heon-young, initially maintained cooperation with the right-wing and the U.S. military government, but after the Moscow 3rd phase meeting, its public position narrowed and the U.S. military government began to suppress the left-wing.

It is said that they created a unified propaganda body called the Cho Kuk Liberation Association in Korea, but its credibility and size are largely questioned. They led the Battle of Bocheonbo and Gansambong during the anti-Japanese armed struggle in Manchuria, and gradually fled to the Soviet Maritime Province in 1940 as the Japanese partisan subjugation intensified in the late 1930s. After receiving the rank of Soviet officer, he was incorporated into the Far East Army 88th Shooting Brigade for military training, but when the Japanese were defeated and the Soviet army occupied the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, he entered North Korea as a Soviet officer in October 1945. Since then, under the support of the small military government, it has taken the core of the Joseon Rodong Party and the Korean People's Army, and Kim Il-sung has taken over the real power as prime minister of the Cabinet. They followed the Soviet troops into North Korea. The Korean-Chinese military alliance that has continued so far is a blood alliance with this historical root."
