HUM.1.t:0 "Southwark hosts its first Referendum"
HUM.1.d:0 "Our great Kingdom of Humanity witnessed our first major political referendum, sparked by the growing Republican Movement led by Christopher Schroeder. This movement called for the establishment of a modern republic, arguing it would fulfill the original vision of our kingdom’s founder, Captain James Georges Meads, who dreamed of an artificial nation open to all races and peoples from around the globe. Schroeder and his supporters challenged our current benevolent Meads Dynasty monarchy, advocating for a more inclusive, democratic system. The referendum has ignited debates across the Kingdom about our future direction and cultural identity."
HUM.2.t:0 "Vietnamese Refugees spotted"
HUM.2.d:0 "Amid the escalating violence of the Indochina War, a group of Vietnamese fishermen sought refuge in the Moroc-Songhrati Archipelago, petitioning King Morton I of the Kingdom of Humanity for asylum. Fleeing the dangers of the conflict, these fishermen appealed to the King for protection and the chance to start anew in the peaceful islands. Moved by their plight, King Morton I considered their request, recognizing the humanitarian need and the potential for integrating the refugees into the Kingdom's very small population . The event highlighted the Archipelago's growing role as a sanctuary amidst regional turmoil."

This was formalized in a small ceremony in Saigon with the attendance from King Morton I and a Vietnamese diplomat.\n\nThe recognition by the our state has provided the Kingdom of Morac-Songhrati-Meads with a semblance of legitimacy on the international stage. However, the recognition did little to change the practical control of the islands, as various other nations continued to dispute the territory."
VIE_Humanity.2.d:0 "Amidst the complicated geopolitical shifts in Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese Government and their leader Bao-Dai, have recognized the the sovereignty and rightful claims of our great Kingdom of Humanity and our righteous cause of unifying all of humanity under the Meads Dynasty's enlightened rules.\n\nA small ceremony has been hosted in Saigon with the attendance from our wise King Morton I and the Vietnamese government.

VIE_Humanity.3.d:0 "Saigon, [GetMonth].[GetYear] - In a surprising yet surreal diplomatic move, the Vietnamese government, led by Emperor Bao-Dai, has formally recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Moroc-Songhrati-Meads also known as the Kingdom of Humanity, a micronation claiming colonizing the long disputed Spratly Islands. The ceremony, held in Saigon, saw the attendance of King Morton I of the Meads Dynasty and Vietnamese officials.\n\nThis recognition grants the Kingdom of Humanity a degree of international legitimacy, bolstering its claims and efforts against other foreign colonizers in the region. The event underscores the complex geopolitical shifts in Southeast Asia, as Vietnam seeks to navigate and assert its influence amid competing territorial claims."

### Phu Dai Army 1950's Events ###
PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet's Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang's forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang's forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China's Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this \"Republic\" seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

Our young nation recognized internationally as the State of Vietnam shall be granted greater independence from France within the multi continental system of the French Union, a momentous accomplishment that was the culmination of months of hard work by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai. The Elysee Accords will now move to the French National Assembly, to be officially ratified and signed by the French president.\n\nThe accords stated that Vietnam could now conduct its own foreign affairs, control its finances and have an army. Specifically, we were granted the right to appoint diplomats to China, Thailand, and the Vatican City, but the remainder of our foreign policy will remain under French guidance. Some may decry this as falling short of granting complete independence, but the matter of fact is that this was the best we could have got, especially in such turbulent times where pushing our French benefactors away would be complete suicide."

We can only appoint diplomats to the Republic of China, Thailand, and Vatican City. Though we will not be able to have any major impact on the world, we can still negotiate with two of our neighbors regarding any issues that may arise. Considering the current situation of the Indochinese peninsula, the French are not merely our benefactors but also our saviors from the Communist North. In the future, we may even negotiate with the Great Powers of the day as Equals and not as mere French puppets."

There are rumours that Nguyen-Van-Xuan is holding out for a different leader or, at the very least, a different solution and is stalling negotiations to unify.

Fortunately, the main holdout to unification is Nguyen-Van-Xuan, who is loyal to us; with a certain amount of \"pressure,\" he can likely be persuaded to unify.

He carries a heavy weight on his back and it is no surprise or crime for him to indulge in human pleasures.

Their concerns centered on Diem's latest manifesto, which had just been published in our newspapers. This piece contained deeply unsettling and radical ideas, with the apparent intent of sowing the seeds of rebellion among our populace, urging them to rise against both our fledgling government and our French benefactors.\n\nThe Chief of Security at Xac-Te emphasized that prompt action should have been taken to remove Diem from the equation, underscoring the potential threat posed by his Christian Social Movement. The fear was that if allowed to continue, Diem could inflict further damage upon our government's struggle against the encroaching specter of northern communism and disrupt the fragile stability we sought to maintain.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Diem's manifesto, which sheds light on his ideological stance:\n\n"We must recognize that our current struggle extends beyond mere political independence for our homeland. It is, in essence, a SOCIALIST REVOLUTION, aimed at securing FREEDOM for the FARMERS AND WORKERS OF VIETNAM! Our ultimate objective is to ensure that every individual in Vietnam possesses the means of production, enabling them to lead lives of dignity. To achieve this, I advocate for progressive and bold social reforms that will not only safeguard our human dignity but also usher in an era of growth and evolution."\n\nThe urgency of the situation is undeniable, and the need to rectify our course is immediate."

The election pits Prime Minister Ngo-dinh-Diem, a visionary leader advocating for independence and reform, against former Emperor Bao-dai, who seeks to maintain the status quo with close ties to France.\n\nMany in South Vietnam view Diem as the leader who can finally break the country free from colonial influence. His promise to build a Republic under the principles of Labour Personalism—focusing on empowering the working class, promoting progressive ideas, and modernizing society—has inspired hope for a new, independent Vietnam. To many, Diem represents a future where Vietnam can stand on its own, free from foreign interference.\n\nOn the other hand, Bao-dai, who abdicated in 1945 but continues to hold the title of head of state, represents the old order. He proposes to keep the pro-French monarchy in place, believing that maintaining these ties will ensure stability and financial aid. Yet, his distant leadership and lavish lifestyle abroad have led many to question his commitment to the country’s well-being.\n\nAs South Vietnam remains fractured—its countryside controlled by powerful religious sects like the Cao-dai and Hoa-hao, and the streets of Saigon under the grip of the Binh-xuyen crime syndicate—the people of South Vietnam see the upcoming referendum as their chance to reclaim the future. For some, Diem is the revolutionary figure who can unify the nation, while for others, Bao-dai promises of stability hold appeal but the voting is yet to be voted…"

This alliance represents a powerful convergence of political and labor forces, seeking to harness the strength of Vietnam's workers in the fight for independence and social justice.

VIE_Historical.1.t: "Saigon Intellectuals Protest War"
VIE_Historical.1.d: "Saigon, June 1949 Engineer Luu-Van-Lang, the first native engineer of Indochina, has led a small but significant protest in Saigon against our ongoing war against the Northern Communist expansion. Known for his patriotic fervor, Engineer Lang, alongside hundreds of intellectuals, called for an end to hostilities and urged our French benefactors and our authorities to negotiate peace with Ho Chi Minh.\n\nGathered in a public square in front of the Hôtel de ville, 1st District, the protesters held banners and chanted slogans advocating for anti-French stances in the government and peace. They presented a declaration signed by leading intellectuals, demanding immediate negotiations to cease the conflict but it was quickly stopped by the Police and Gendarmerie who quickly swept the Square clean!"
VIE_Historical.1.a: "It's best to shoot these dissidents next time!"

VIE_Historical.2.t: "Student Strike at Petrus Ky Lycée"
VIE_Historical.2.d: "Saigon, November 23, 1949 - On the ninth anniversary of the Viet-Minh's Southern Uprising, a massive strike erupted among the students in Saigon. The strike was triggered as an aftermath of the Xac-te's mass arrests of several students from the Petrus Ky Lycée for subversions against our government.\n\nTran-van-On, an infamous rebellious student, has led a group of students from Petrus Ky Lycée in the protest. Demonstrating exceptional leadership, he guided the march through Saigon's streets, demanding the release of their peers and an end to colonial oppression which has disrupted many daily activities in Saigon."
VIE_Historical.2.a: "We really need to restore stability!"

VIE_Historical.3.t: "Massive Student Protest in Saigon again?!"
VIE_Historical.3.d: "A massive demonstration re-erupted in Saigon with Tran-van-On leading the dissidents, comprised of more over 6,000 students and teachers from various schools demanding the immediate release of their arrested peers and political liberalization. The protesters demand [VIE.GetLeader] to address and implement their demands. By 1pm, our Quoc-gia government responded with a heavy-handed approach, deploying a large gendarmerie force and the Xac-te to suppress the demonstration. Water cannons were used, and protesters were brutally beaten with batons. The crackdown resulted in 150 arrests and 30 serious injuries. In response to the escalating unrest, our forces in Saigon faces two critical options:"
VIE_Historical.3.a: "Let negotiate with them, we can at least implement some of their demands"
VIE_Historical.3.b: "Shot On and those rebels NOW!"

VIE_Historical.4.t: "Tran-Van-On's Death!!"
VIE_Historical.4.d: "Saigon, January 9, 1950- During the ongoing student protest demanding the release of arrested peers and political liberalization, Tran-Van-On was shot by our police forces while helping a fellow student climb over a wall protecting a vital Governmental building in the 1st District . Despite being rushed to Cho-Ray Hospital, Tran-Van-On succumbed to his injuries at 3:30 p.m. He was … 19 years old. Sadly, Tran-Van-On's death has completely backfired our attempt to end the unrest , it instead has intensified the anger among dissidents, leading to more radical and destructive actions. The incident has further polarized the student movement, escalating tensions and heightening the struggle for reforms and resistance against the Quoc-gia's cause and French's authority!"
VIE_Historical.4.a: "We need to do something quick!"

VIE_Historical.6.t: "Negotiations with Tran-van-On"
VIE_Historical.6.d: "Saigon, February 1950- In response to the recent widespread student unrests and broke down of social orders in Saigon, our Quoc-gia government has agreed to negotiate and conceded to some of the students' demands with a small meeting between [VIE.GetLeader] and Tran-van-On directly in the Hôtel de ville. Our government has agreed to implement small scale reforms including a more liberalized jail system, increased academic freedoms and a pledge to promote Vietnamese patriotism and culture. Our decision, while appeasing the local population and quelling immediate unrest but it has infuriated the French government in Paris. Paris has issued a letter of protest, viewed the concessions as undermining stability and paving the way for Communist infiltrations."
VIE_Historical.6.a: "It's the \"best outcome.\""

VIE_Historical.7.t: "Tran Van On's Funeral"
VIE_Historical.7.d: "Saigon, January 12, 1950- After securing permission from our government , Tran-Van-On's body was brought to lie in state for three days at a farewell house on Thuan-Kieu Street, Saigont. A funeral altar and spirit tablet were set up at Petrus Ky School, where all students wore black armbands in mourning. From January 10 to 12, a diverse array of mourners, including workers, intellectuals, businessmen, civil servants, artists, journalists, and students, visited to pay their respects, with over 300 wreaths laid, including those from French "Soldats démocrates" (Democratic Soldiers) organization. Tran-Van-On's funeral on January 12 attracted tens of thousands, with more than 300,000 Saigon residents taking to the streets in support. The procession was led by prominent intellectuals like engineer Luu-Van-Lang, lawyer Trinh Dinh Thao, Nguyen-Huu-Tho, and several dissidents. An estimated 25,000 people participated in the march, with many more lining the streets, ending with Tran-Van-On's burial at Cho Lon cemetery."
VIE_Historical.7.a: "It ENDED for … now?"

VIE_Historical.8.t: "Red Cross Society founded"
VIE_Historical.8.d: "In 1951 , Dr. Ho-Van-Nhut founded the Red Cross Society of South Vietnam ( Hoi Hong-thap-Tu ) to address the ongoing degeneration of basic medical needs and urgent need for civilian support amid the ongoing war and complicated natural disasters. The new Organization was quickly accepted by the International Red Cross Society, the organization was named the Vietnam Red Cross Society (HHTT) and headquartered on Hong-Thap-Tu street in Saigon. Under Dr. Ho-Van-Nhut's talented leadership, funds were mobilized to build the Red Cross headquarters, establish the first native nursing school and free first-aid course in South Vietnam, and set up free clinics for the poor. These efforts significantly bolstered the region's healthcare and humanitarian assistance infrastructure."

The letter then concluded with a personal offer from Hung himself to raise an elite Anti-Communist Militia unit in Cochinchina which will be staffed with ex Phuc-Quoc and ex IJA members.The Xac-Te was also able to confirm past activities of Hung including being an ex-KMT Major General in the 1930s but we will need to rethink the decision wisely. On one hand, we do need all of the help we can get for the Quoc-Gia cause but Hung is confirmed to still be supporting Cuong-De's cause and will be difficult to contain."

Initial_CuongDe.1.d:0 "Gia-Long, first Emperor of the Nguyen dynasty, experienced the devastating tragedy of outliving his own eldest son, Prince Nguyen-Phuc-Canh, who did leave behind a son prior to his death. Despite that, the throne was passed to Gia-Long's fourth son, Minh-Mang, ancestor of our current Head-of-State Bao-Dai. But the past has come back to haunt us once more, for Cuong-De, descendant of Prince Canh, has become quite a thorn in our side by utilizing his heritage to further his personal political goals.\n\nEducated in Japan, Cuong-De was a key figure in the Dong Du (On the Way to the East) movement, which sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. Facing much persecution from the French, he still nonetheless evaded capture and found the Viet-Nam Quang-Phuc Hoi (Vietnam Restoration Organisation) alongside Phan-Boi-Chau in 1911, hoping to overthrow French colonial rule in Vietnam and establish a democratic republic. The organization failed to gain momentum, crippled by arrests of its members. Cuong-De did not give up, however, and later created the Viet-Nam Phuc-quoc Dong-minh Hoi (League for the Restoration of Vietnam) in 1938 and attempted to court Japanese support.\n\nNow that order has been restored to our country and the French has returned, Cuong-De's ambitions can not be left unchecked any longer. Having given a public press conference declaring his intent to return to Vietnam and form an opposition to our government, we must make sure that this illegitimate upstart does not gain any further influence. Proposals personally drafted by Bao-Dai will be sent to major foreign powers like France and the United States requesting that they ignore Cuong-De, while a diplomatic protest will be issued to Japan for hosting him as a citizen."

In a scathing rebuke to the accusations made by Cuong-De, the Head of State Bao-Dai has stated that we are merely using Cuong-De as a tool to undermine his rule. Bao-Dai has restated embarrassing revelations about Cuong-De's countless past failure to liberate Vietnam and his collaboration during the Second World War have invalidated any claim to rule in Vietnam. It is believed that the statements being made by Cuong-De might be stirring up popular support in Vietnam, and the Vietnamese government is in a frenzy that Cuong-De could end their rule. The Vietnamese ambassador has emphasised that continuing to host Cuong-De will damage relations and could even lead to an embargo. The French have also expressed frustration with the statements of Cuong-De accusing him of undermining efforts to restore order in Vietnam. Cuong-De has made several requests to be returned to Vietnam to further the nationalist cause, however, it is not clear how we could repatriate him. Some in our intelligence agency have suggested attempting to smuggle him across the border."

Most days, nothing happens, but the fear stays; I wake up and just want to be home. I saw the news that we have new allies \"integrated\" into the army. They're not my allies; I watched as one of Leroy's \"UMDC Catholic militias\" cut and hacked through random people whom we knew were innocent; that's not the cause I thought we were fighting for. Not to mention that with some of these French's new units, if you turn your back too long, they'll shoot you. We are fighting as best as we can, but this is different than fighting the Japanese. Our French advisors and veteran officers from past world wars don't have any experience fighting something like this. We can go through a village ten times and see nothing wrong, and then the next time, we get ambushed. I'm beginning to think that some of our units are passing on information.

VIE_Sect_Militias.2.d:0 "In the middle of the night, several French high colonial command staff enter a utilitarian building that stands amidst lush, tropical vegetation, and the building's exterior shows signs of wear from the humid climate and occasional rain. Inside, the meeting room where the officers and Vietnamese staff members are gathered exudes an atmosphere of seriousness and tension. The room is adorned with functional furniture, such as a long wooden table and simple chairs. The walls are adorned with maps of the region and photographs of key military figures, one of them specifically being Phan-Van-Giao's.\n\nThe atmosphere is palpably tense as the officers and staff members grapple with the urgent and rising threat of the nationalistic militia group known as the Bao-Dai. A relatively mature formation of paramilitaries who had fought both for and against the Japanese oppression, but most importantly, they fought the French on every step they took. The Vietnamese staff discuss the matter with hushed voices, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The weight of responsibility and the potential consequences of their decisions hang heavy in the air, giving the room an almost suffocating feeling. Finally, the voice of a French officer broke the tense silence with a concerned tone, "We can't ignore the threat posed by this nationalistic, monarchist, militia group. They are well-armed and well-trained, and their return is certainly alarming."\n\nOutside the building, the sounds of the bustling military camp can be heard, with soldiers training, vehicles moving, and orders being barked together with the occasional dog bark. After one of those said dogs bark, a second French Officer continues with a well-put-out tone, "Agreed, their history of fighting against us makes their integration into the Vietnamese army a delicate decision as well as a difficult state of cooperation between our forces and theirs."\n\nThe humid air carries a mix of aromas, including the scent of sweat, foliage, and the faint smell of gunpowder from recent drills fills the nostrils of the high echelons of people present at this meeting. A complicated environment for complicated people and this was reflected by the following response by a Vietnamese commander, "But if we don't integrate them, they could become a destabilizing force, and arresting them might just escalate the situation further. Yet at the same time, integrating them could provide valuable insights into their motives and future actions."\n\nLowering his voice, he leans into the ear of the Vietnamese Chief of Staff so that the French would not pry on this rather sensible topic, "Remember, they are our people and they fought for our independence, regardless of our different views. There might be common ground for reconciliation." Finally, the Vietnamese army commander lifts his head and looks at the ever-suspicious French generals and comments with a calculated tone. "We must assess the risks and benefits." The French all give each other a look before one of the officers decisively comments "We should." Yet they have not come to any decision as of now. For? They have locked their eyes at the Vietnamese Chief of Staff who has been silent all this time. Waiting for his input, the tension density in the air grows to an almost palpable degree, but just before it has reached the boiling point, he spoke,"

These deployments were made in anticipation of a potential return to our homeland. Among these, a notable contingent, nearly 33,000 troops under the command of General Huang Chieh, interned themselves on the South Vietnamese island of Phu Quoc. Apart from these forces, our troops have also maintained a presence in Burma.\n\nSince their deployment, these troops have largely remained stationed in Phu Quoc but have since planned to return home. The ongoing conflict in Vietnam presents considerable risks for these forces to rejoin us, as any movement would necessitate navigating through waters controlled by the NVA and PRC or undertaking a difficult alternative route. Amidst these challenging circumstances, the South Vietnamese government has extended an intriguing proposal. They seek our army's engagement in their conflict against the Marxists in the North. Engaging our forces in this manner could significantly impact the advance of communism, a prospect that is currently under intense deliberation. It is also anticipated that such a move would likely receive support from the American side.\n\nGeneral Huang Chieh, who has been operating semi-autonomously, has yet to be informed of this proposal. We stand at a crossroads with the power to either advance this idea or dismiss it before it reaches the General. The decision presents two distinct options:"

However, the political status of the city has been vague and has turned into a sort of de facto condominium between the former Annam High Residence and the Nguyen Protectorate. While it's best to ignore such minor conflicts, we received very concerning news about military skirmishes and militarization in the Central Highlands which can destroy our currently already deteriorating war against the Communists.
