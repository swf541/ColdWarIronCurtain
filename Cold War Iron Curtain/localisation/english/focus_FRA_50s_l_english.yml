 SUPER_EVENT_WINTER_OF_1954_DESC:0 "In winter 1954, when the temperature fell below -15°C for a prolonged period, Abbé Pierre, a former resistance fighter and former MRP deputy, launched national media appeals for social solidarity to help the poor and the destitute. home in danger of freezing to death in complete social and media ignorance. This is the beginning of the "Insurrection of Goodness"."
 abbe_pierre.1.d:0 "My friends, come help ... A woman froze to death tonight at 3:00 AM, on the pavement of Sebastopol Boulevard, clutching the eviction notice which the day before had made her homeless... Each night, more than two thousand endure the cold, without food, without bread, more than one almost naked. To face this horror, emergency lodgings are not enough. Hear me; in the last three hours, two aid centers have been created: one under canvas at the foot of the Panthéon, on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève Street; the other in Courbevoie. They are already overflowing, we must open them everywhere. Tonight, in every town in France, in every quarter of Paris, we must hang out placards under a light in the dark, at the door of places where there are blankets, bunks, soup; where one may read, under the title 'Fraternal Aid Center', these simple words: 'If you suffer, whoever you are, enter, eat, sleep, recover hope, here you are loved'. The forecast is for a month of harsh frosts. For as long as the winter lasts, for as long as the centers exist, faced with their brothers dying in poverty, all mankind must be of one will: the will to make this situation impossible. I beg of you, let us love one another enough to do it now. From so much pain, let a wonderful thing be given unto us: the shared spirit of France. Thank you! Everyone can help those who are homeless. We need, tonight, and at the latest tomorrow, five thousand blankets, three hundred big American tents, and two hundred catalytic stoves. Bring them quickly to the Hôtel Rochester, number ninety-two, la Boetie Street. The rendez-vous for volunteers and trucks to carry them: tonight at eleven, in front of the tent on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. Thanks to you, no man, no child, will sleep on the asphalt or on the waterfronts of Paris tonight"

 FRA_NATO_PCF.1.d:0 "Following its electoral victory the Parti Communiste Francais (PCF) began acting on its mandate. Since the creation of NATO in 1949, many in France had grown suspicious the alliance eroded the independence of the French military and state. More significantly, the PCF argued the alliance sought to subvert the will of the people within member states. The United States could eventually leverage NATO to actively target the left or any group deemed a threat. With these concerns and thoughts, the PCF announced it had terminated France's NATO membership and will withdraw France from NATO completely. France would no longer be a tool to imperialist interests from the United States or even the United Kingdom and it would finally be completely independent from outside influences. News of France's decision to terminate its NATO membership has shook Washington and London. Both had envisioned France as being the main pillar for the defense of NATO member states, especially in continental Europe. The Soviet Union is said to have welcomed the announcement and looks forward to continuing to work with the new French government."
 ALG_Partition.1.d:0 "The French government today implemented its partition of Algeria. The plan was conceived by several senior advisors to the President and members of the National Assembly who seek to separate the European areas of Algeria from the non-European areas. Observers noted the French happened to draw these partition lines in such a way that left European section access to key infrastructures and resource deposits, at the expense of demographic realities on the ground. The French argue the partition will give the pieds noir and the Arab populations the right of self-governance and argue this will result in security and a lasting peace. However, critics point out the drawing of the borders leaves thousands of Arabs outside their areas and the Arab Algerian state lacks access to key resources. Considering the history of the Balkans and more recent history in the Middle East, this situation seems ripe for continued violence, mass deportation, or political repression instead of lasting peace. Internationally, France's plan has been met with muted responses from major colonial powers and the United States. They hope the plan will lead to more peace but have chosen not to publicly endorse the French policy. Among the Arab World and the decolonized states of Africa and Asia the response has been heated rhetoric in condemnation to what is seen as an effort to preserve imperialism." 
 Gladio_Reveal.1.d:0 "In a stunning press conference in Paris, the French government announced the discovery of a secret paramilitary army within France and all NATO states. Following World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom established secret arm caches and cells of fighters to activate into a resistance movement in the event of a Soviet invasion. The program was called Operation Gladio and was established in Allied occupied areas of Germany, Italy, and France. By the formation of NATO the program of sleeping cells of paramilitaries were present throughout member states. The French government stated patriotic officers of the French Army informed the government of this secret organization amid fears the United States planned on activating the French paramilitary forces to destabilize the French government. The Minister of Defense stated, "France has made this information public in order to protect ourselves from foreign aggression and showcase to our European friends what American \"freedom\" really entails!" Upon the news breaking, citizens in NATO states have taken to the streets to protest these secret armies."
 VIN_PCF.1.d:0 "The war in Indochina had dragged on since 1946, with France spending a lot of blood and money to return the territory to French rule. However, the PCF, along with many others, long recognized this conflict only served to restore French colonialism in an era of decolonization. The PCF saw the conflict the seeds to a French decline, not a restoration of past glories. As the conflict dragged on, the French state grew increasingly dependent on economic and military aid from the United States. Fighting an imperialist war after securing an electoral mandate from the French people to rule in their interests made no sense. With these considerations, the French government has announced it will recognize an independent Vietnamese state under the control of the Viet Minh, who brought together all the major independence parties in the country and are clearly the best representatives of Vietnamese interests. Paris reacted jubilantly to the news as thousands of students took to the street and celebrated the end of the war. The troops were coming home and France's nightmare in Indochina was coming to an end."
 French_Euroskepticism.1.d:0 "The Treaty of Rome and the resulting European Economic Union (EEU) represented everything President Pierre Poujade and his fellow Poujadists hated. In an address to the nation, President Poujade articulated that the organization will take away French economic sovereignty and put the French under the thumb of foreign elites and the international corporations backing them. The policies the EEU support would eventually see the destruction of French culture and society. Farmers will be forced to industrialize on a massive scale to compete in the market, destroying the countryside and their way of life. France's beautiful cities will be transformed into urban factories leading to moral decline and an expansion of decadent foreign ideas. To prevent such a disaster, President Poujade announced France would reject the Treaty of Rome and withdraw from the EEU completely. France will have no part in an organization destined to destroy European sovereignty and identity. For signatories of the Treaty of Rome, the French withdrawal is a huge blow to the dream of a unified, European market and economic union."
 ALG_Comp.3.d:0 "With the results of the two recent referendums, one by the mainland and one by the pieds noirs, the French military in Algeria has decided to act. Under the direction of retired General Raoul Salan, elite French units Algiers, have quickly seized control of the city. Across Algeria other units have taken key locations, in particular radio stations, ports, and airports. General Salan announced the military had seized control of Algeria in order to preserve the freedom and lives of the pieds noirs and pro-French Muslims. He has proclaimed the Republic of Algeria under his leadership and have vowed to not abandon Algeria or let the sacrifices of the military go in vain. The French government in Paris has been taken by complete surprise by these developments and efforts to communicate with Algeria or even intervene are quite limited due to the seizure of key installations by the rebellious soldiers. Many observers believe progress on peace talks have now been halted and if the situation persists, the fighting in Algeria may pick up to a new intensity."
 ALG_Comp.4.d:0 "military junta led by General Raoul Salan were not progressing. French authorities were especially annoyed as Salan and his supporters used the time spent on negotiations to completely take over all administration of Algeria from the government. One French official noted that the government could no longer cater to a cabal of mutinous officers. A representative of the self-styled Republic of Algeria only stated that Algeria remains French and free only through the leadership of General Salan and his brave officers. Observers note a refusal of trade or relations could cause a major supply crisis for the Salan regime. It appears France hopes such a crisis could force Salan to back down."
 ALG_Comp.5.d:0 "In the aftermath of the take over of Algeria by General Raoul Salan and the proclamation of the Republic of Algeria, many in France have demanded an explanation on how the government so horribly managed the situation. In the wake of denouncements in the National Assembly and street protests, President René Coty has tendered his resignation. In a written statement he expressed his regret at how things have ended up and hopes his successor will be able to save France from disaster, pointing out a new direction maybe needed as the current system of politics lead to disunity and instability. His successor is conservative politician Antoine Pinay. Many observers appreciate Pinay's successes in finance and economic policies throughout his career and he is seen as a seasoned politician. The hope is this experience can translate to helping guide the nation towards political unity in the face of France's international problems and the Republic of Algeria crisis."
 FFL_Relocation.1.d:0 "The French Foreign Legion (FFL) has long been the shock troops of the French empire and nation. Its personnel have long embraced the principals of what it means to be French and have long been relied on by the government in times of crisis. However, during the recent military takeover in Algeria, several Foreign Legion units participated and actively joined in the takeover. This has made the unit suspect to the French government who have decided to withdraw the FFL from Algeria. The FFL units from Algeria are to be disbanded with the personnel reassigned to other FFL units. Reports near the main FFL barracks in Siddi Bel Abbes indicate fires and loud noises are being heard inside. Apparently the personnel have become enraged by these developments and have burned a historical relic from the regiment's history. Through angry, it is expected the legionaries will comply as they remain devoted to France and the reward of French citizenship upon completing their duty. Paris is confident the FFL will return in good order and hope to rehabilitate its personnel upon its return to the mainland."
 FRA_Referendum.10.d:0 "The people of France and her territories are voting on accepting the new constitution produced under the supervision of Charles de Gaulle. The recent crisis in Algeria precipitated unrest in the streets, among the military, and instability in the National Assembly. National hero Charles de Gaulle returned to politics and called for an end to the Fourth Republic. Demanding a new constitution that would better suit France. The failure of the government to respond to these challenges effectively led to the Fourth Republic dissolving itself and holding a constitutional assembly under de Gaulle's rule. The new constitution seeks to create a strong Presidential system and grants de Gaulle emergency powers for the first six months. The Fourth Republic had kept power in the legislature, but its provisions designed to prevent political disunity largely failed. De Gaulle's constitution sought to aid France in dealing with the pressing issues of the Cold War and decolonization. The French electorate faces two choices in the referendum. Whether to accept de Gaulle's constitution and proclaim a Fifth Republic or reject it."
 ALG_Comp.1.d:0 "The French government has decided on a referendum for the people of France. It asks the population to approve a plan to offer the peoples of Algeria the right of self-determination. The referendum states: \"Do you approve the bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic and concerning the self-determination of the populations of Algeria and the organization of the public authorities in Algeria prior to self-determination?" The government hopes having public support through the referendum for its plans will allow it to resolve the Algerian war and make difficult decisions with the French people taken in confidence. Opponents see this as the beginning of a French surrender of Algeria and abandonment of French soil and citizens. Supporters of the referendum say self-determination reflects French democratic values and view the status quo in Algeria as unsustainable."
 ALG_Comp.2.d:0 "The pieds noirs have been living in Algeria since 1830. Representing over ten percent of Algeria's population, this group has been critical in the administration, economic, social, and cultural development of Algeria since French colonization began. Since the Algerian War began, the pieds noirs have proven vital in supporting the colonial government's efforts to defeating the rebels. They have provided vital intelligence, military volunteers, and safe areas for French forces to operate from. With the French government in the mainland increasingly moving towards recognizing self-determination, the pieds noirs leaders have argued this route will lead to Algerian independence, majority rule, and the destruction of their way of life. They see no chance of a compromise with the majority population who to them lack the cultural development or political maturity to reconcile. Massacres and repression will be their future. Continued reliance on France to serve its interests can no longer be relied on. Instead, the pieds noirs must control their own destiny and secure Algeria. To achieve this, the pied noir leadership has organized a referendum about whether Algeria should be governed and ruled by the pieds noir. This minority rule system would ensure Algeria's identity and more importantly preserve Algeria from degradation. A rejection of this referendum will mean an acceptance of self-determination."
 MNA.1.d:0 "The Algerian National Movement (ANM) has emerged under the leadership of nationalist Messali Hadj as an alternative nationalist movement to the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN). The FLN long claimed to be the sole representative of the Algerian people in the struggle against French colonialism. The emergence of the ANM challenges this view and reports have arrived that the FLN are plotting to take the group out. Perhaps it will be in France's interest to covertly fund and support the ANM, as its leader did not initially support the FLN's armed struggle. If the group grows in strength, it will lead to infighting among the nationalist groups. This can give our security forces more freedom and help us break up the rebels more easily as we can play the groups off each other. We have to decide if we want to covertly support the ANM and hope they can divide the FLN's message and fighting ability."

 FRA_Elections_of_1951:0 "Legislative elections of 1951"
 FRA_Elections_of_1951_desc:0 "The French Elections of 1951 may prove to be a major turning point for the Republic. The main contestants are the Troisieme Force, the RPF and the PCF. Our Western friends hope that either the Troisieme Force or the RPF wins, as a victory for the PCF will be a problem, but we never truly know what the future holds."
 
 ### RPF VICTORY ###
 
 FRA_RPF_Victory:0 "RPF Majority"
 FRA_RPF_Victory_desc:0 "The Conservative Party of France, or the RPF, has been able to secure an electoral majority in Parliament. With this they have also installed a loyal Prime Minister, meaning if everything works out the future of France might be in the hands of Charles De Gaulle."
 FRA_Economic_Third_Way:0 "Economic Third Way"
 FRA_Economic_Third_Way_desc:0 "The French Economy has been trying to compromise between the left and right for far too long.

With this law the French Economy shall adapt the basic principles of Capitalism and start its total abandonment of Communism."
 FRA_Presidential_Empowerment_decree:0 "Presidential Empowerment Decree"
 FRA_Presidential_Empowerment_decree_desc:0 "We have nearly always advocated for a more powerful president. Today our Prime Minister is planning on forming a decree to do just that, and with the approval of the President it should become a law."
 FRA_Reform_the_voting_system:0 "Reform the Voting System"
 FRA_Reform_the_voting_system_desc:0 "The French Voting system is a disaster. It is overseen by a corrupt parliament that always votes for its members' benefit, and the French Presidential Elections are a mess as well. It's time to end this. The French Electoral System must change."
 FRA_Reform_the_RTF:0 "Reform the RTF"
 FRA_Reform_the_RTF_desc:0 "The Radio Television Francaise has been a proud and distinguished TV station for a long time, but it has grown old, rusty and some would say even useless. Due to that, we have planned out a program for its reform and restoration to its former place."
 FRA_Favorize_Gaullist_Syndicates:0 "Favorize Gaullist Syndicates"
 FRA_Favorize_Gaullist_Syndicates_desc:0 "There are many syndicates in our nation that promote or follow a wide range of ideologies. Owing to Charles De Gaulle's large popularity among them and the similarities between our agendas, it makes sense to favor them in Parliament."

 FRA_Appoint_Giscard_Finances_Minister_desc:0 "Valery Giscard, an arguably conservative leaning politician, has proven to be a useful economic advisor on a local level.

 FRA_Pragmatic_Politics:0 "Pragmatic Politics"
 FRA_Pragmatic_Politics_desc:0 "Blasted Fourth Republic! Our Politicians and President have been doing nothing, sitting on their behinds, and waiting for a miracle. It is time to end that! We, the RPF, can wait no longer, and the moment has come for the Republic to take Action!"

 FRA_Breakup_of_the_Troisieme_Force_Coalition_desc:0 "The Centrist Politicians, rather than admit defeat and work with us, are trying to drag our glorious country down with them.

 FRA_National_Referendum_on_the_Republic:0 "National Referendum on the Republic"
 FRA_National_Referendum_on_the_Republic_desc:0 "The Third Republic is simply a backwards system. The President has nearly no power, while the Prime Minister, often a puppet of the Parliament, practically bathes in it. The Parliament, idiotic as ever won't change that, but the people, they aren't as foolish, and, they WILL change it, and  we shall give them the right to do so by voting on the referendum."
 FRA_Marginalization_of_the_Communists:0 "Marginalization of the Communists"
 FRA_Marginalization_of_the_Communists_desc:0 "The Parti Communiste are Soviet agents and nothing more, and for that they need to be marginalized in the next elections.

 FRA_Devaluate_the_Franc_desc:0 "The French Franc has been kept on such a high value for so long, it has nearly destroyed our economy. We must devalue it quickly, before our Economy and Currency fall too far to be saved."

 FRA_Propose_a_constitutional_Reform_desc:0 "The Third Republic is over. Our message has resonated with our people, who want to move on from the lame duck governments of the past.
