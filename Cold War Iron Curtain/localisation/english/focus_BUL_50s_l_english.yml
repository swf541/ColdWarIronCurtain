 BUL_The_Bulgarian_Peoples_Army_desc:0 "After the proclamation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1946, the celebration of the military holiday on 6 May was stopped, with the date of 23 September was designated as the Day of the Bulgarian People's Army. Its significance lies in it being the day of the staging of the September Uprising in 1923. In, the first military parade of the People's Army held on the occasion of the coup's anniversary. The new holiday was reorganized on the Soviet model with the direct participation of Soviet officers, equipped with Soviet weapons and equipment. Leading positions were occupied by Soviet officers of Bulgarian origin, and much of the command staff was trained in the Soviet Union."
