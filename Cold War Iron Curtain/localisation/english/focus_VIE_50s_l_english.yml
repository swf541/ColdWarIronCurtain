 PQC_1950s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, the Sino-French Sima Treaty was negotiated and signed between He Zhuben, RoC General Hoang Kiet's Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Staff of the French colonial forces in Vietnam.\n\nThe treaty stipulated the process for the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops from China via Vietnam and the city of Haiphong, where they will surrender their weapons to the French authorities; who will be responsible for delivering them back to the Government of the Republic of China. As per the agreement, groups will be composed of 500 each, with priority given to fleeing women and children.\n\nHowever, strong condemnation by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, caused the French colonial authorities to reconsider their agreement, after Hoang's forces had already entered Vietnam. For a time, the Phu Dai Army, as it is known, was interned in camps around Haiphong, before the French authorities transported them to Phu Quoc Island, a largely undeveloped island under the control of Vietnam, where their fate is uncertain."
 PQC_1950s.1.d:0 "CONFIDENTIAL\n[GetDateText]\n\nSUBJECT: Futai (Phu Dai) Force Situation Report\n\nGeneralissimo,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Ministry of National Defense that Nationalist forces are trapped on the lightly developed Vietnamese island of Fuguo, also known as Phu Quoc Island. As the result of an abortive agreement between our Government and the French colonial forces in Indochina, an army under the command of General Huang Jie is residing there currently, having been interned in Haiphong and subsequently exiled to the island.\n\nGeneral Huang has contacted us in the hope of receiving support from the Government. It may be in our best interest to support them and provide Huang's forces with more weapons, as their location in Phu Quoc is a strategic benefit for our hopeful strike against the traitorous Communist forces in the mainland.\n\nYour response to this update would be greatly appreciated."
 PQC_1950s.2.d:0 "Our government has learned that the Nationalist Chinese troops under General Hoang Kiet, also known as the Phu Dai Army, have abandoned the island of Phu Quoc where they were placed after the abandonment of the Sino-French Sima Treaty.\n\nAccording to reports, the Phu Dai Army was transported back to Taiwan, where they will be reintegrated into the Republic of China's Marine Corps. This is one less headache that our Government must deal with as we deal with more pressing matters at home."
 PQC_1950s.3.d:0 "According to internal and external reports, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, known as the VNQDD or simply Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off of our southern coast.\n\nReceiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same ideology as the Nationalist Chinese; mainly, the Three Principles of the People as was developed by Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nIt is unclear how our Government should respond immediately, but this is a serious issue and should be addressed with the utmost care and expediency."
 PQC_1950s.4.d:0 "According to reports from around the region, the nationalist Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, VNQDD or Viet Quoc, has founded a republic on the island of Phu Quoc, off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nApparently receiving assistance from Nationalist Chinese troops, known as the Phu Dai Army, stationed there, the VNQDD adheres to the same Kuomintang ideology as the Taiwanese; known as the Three Principles of the People or Tridemism.\n\nRight now, it is unclear how our Government should respond, however, it appears the VNQDD remains diametrically opposed to communism, having come into conflict with our predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, in the years before the Second World War. We should observe and respond to the situation with the appropriate attitude and expediency required."
 PQC_1950s.5.d:0 "A dispatch has come in from our embassy in Saigon that the island of Phu Quoc of the coast of South Vietnam has declared itself a breakaway republic under the leadership of the VNQDD, a Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist-aligned party. Allegedly receiving support from Nationalist troops who fled to the island after the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of Vietnam, as it is calling itself, is requesting that the United States recognize it as a sovereign state.\n\nOur ambassador and diplomatic staff in Saigon are signaling caution; this “Republic” seems to have come as a surprise to both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese officials. Recognizing this state may come with costs, but also will legitimize a renewed Nationalist effort, as well as the spread of Tridemism throughout Southern Asia."
 PQC_1950s.6.d:0 "Good news has come from Washington and Saigon, as the US Ambassador confirms that our Republic has been recognized by the United States as a sovereign state. The Americans, being one of the first to recognize our government, have changed allegiances, previously recognizing the South Vietnamese government to our north as the rightful Vietnamese government.\n\nThis comes as a major victory for not only our foreign affairs, but in our domestic affairs. Now with US recognition, we are able to receive many benefits and our nation will continue to grow!"
 PQC_1950s.7.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in Saigon has communicated that the US State Department has rejected a request for recognition of our government. It appears that the Americans continue to recognize the Vietnamese government in Saigon, as opposed to our VNQDD government, and all attempts to become friendly with the US has been rebuffed."
 PQC_1950s.8.d:0 "Shock echoed around the world today as the United States announced the recognition of the VNQDD-led Republic of Vietnam as the rightful Vietnamese government in the region.\n\nOriginally supporting the Vietnamese government located in Saigon, the Americans have changed their tune to the VNQDD government, mostly composed of Vietnamese nationalists and Nationalist Chinese soldiers, located on Phu Quoc Island off the coast of southern Vietnam. Being closely aligned to the Kuomintang in terms of ideology and geopolitical relations, the VNQDD appears to be the new contender in the geopolitical situation surrounding Indochina."

 #Focus Descs
 
 VIE_Beg_for_Econ_Self_Determination_desc:0 "Vietnam must be economically self-governed, and the French must recognize that with us as a partner rather than a client state, we can achieve more and can build a great economic system that suits us."
 VIE_Auction_off_Imperial_Treasures_desc:0 "The riches of a bygone era can still serve a use for us. The royal treasures that have served the Emperors of the past may still garner a high price on the international market, and that money can be used to infuse our burgeoning national industry."
 VIE_Expand_Saigon_Radio_desc:0 "With spare money and further investments, the aged Radio Saigon shall become a great broadcasting tool for Bao-dai's agendas and as-well broadcasting useful information into our subjects' hearts!"
 VIE_Limited_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "Cautious expansion is the key to steady growth, and in a country that relies on less-than-stable cash flow, we must limit how fast we grow. That will mean a steady hand at the helm and new opportunities to come as they are naturally."
 VIE_Form_3_Ministries_desc:0 "In order to keep growing, we must look to acquire funding from all possible sources. This could mean taking on loans from French banks in order to expand businesses and operate new sources of income for our country."
 VIE_Expand_Local_College_Technique_desc:0 "There is one thing that will always produce a return on investment, and that is education. We need to allocate funding to create a new group in our society of technical experts. We need a generation to have opportunities to help modernise our economy. The reason many countries advance is due to innovation. If we begin to nurture a new highly educated class in society, then Vietnam will become a hub of innovation."
 VIE_Invite_French_Investors_desc:0 "The French businesses that pulled out of our country due to the unrest in the streets hurt our economy badly, but with control reestablished, we can invite them back. Their help will ensure that our industry continues to grow."
 VIE_Import_IBM_Computers_desc:0 "The smooth-talking salesmen of IBM have a solution for everything. Apparently, computers will be able to solve almost every problem. Well, they'll never play chess, but maybe that can help monitor the insurgency system. For a low price, we have been told that a computer system can use punch cards to monitor our success in pacification and track our logistics system. Even the Pentagon uses these computers; we don't want to fall behind. Vietnam will enter the cyber age!"
 VIE_Establish_HoaXa_Vietnam_desc:0 "The railways in this country have suffered from critical war damage, and they lack the ability to carry our industry. We must commission a company to help us repair the lines and help us reconnect the vital arteries of our nation."
 VIE_TongTruong_TaiChinh_KinhTe_desc:0 "The French are receptive to giving us more economic aid, and loans have come available for us to use. In order to use them successfully, we must ensure that the conditions are right and our industries are ready for the repercussions."
 VIE_TongTruong_CanhNong_desc:0 "Though Saigon is a hotbed for light and heavy industry of all types, it is still a city surrounded by farmland, and we can use it to our advantage. Commercial farming must be an important part of our slow march to economic prosperity, and the land in Saigon would be a key part of our commitment."
 VIE_TongTruong_CongChanh_GiaoThong_desc:0 "Though the railways have been hit very hard, the roads fair little better. Many are still dirt roads, apart from the main highways. This requires an initiative on our part, to rebuild damaged sections of the road, and to pave parts of some roads that are used more than others."
 VIE_Introduce_Dong_Currency_desc:0 "At last, we are ready to break from tradition and impose economic independence with the currency we will use. The Vietnamese Dong, the new banknote that will be in circulation, will be backed by strong banks and a strong commitment by the government."
 VIE_SmallScale_Agri_Reforms_desc:0 "The way of life in the Central Highlands and for much of the country is the farming community. Improving their crop yields will also mean a steady hand, as pushing too hard too fast may destroy the farmers and their families, and we need to pursue growth with caution."
 VIE_Widen_Thienly_Highway_Roads_desc:0 "The Central Highways of the country have long been the most reliable source for trucks, cars, and bikes. It serves the country well, and it should be improved and widened, so that we can move more material and industry through it."

 VIE_Open_IBM_Service_Office_decs:0 "For a number of years, the US Computer Giant IBM has been looking to expand its operations into Vietnam. With so many military operations, they think their products could be of assistance. Looking at the current mess that is our Joint Staffs, they could be right. By established a head office, it will allow us to communicate and order from IBM quickly. Perhaps we might get a bulk discount?"
 VIE_Further_Inveset_in_Saigon_desc:0 "Saigon is filthy and free. The pearl of our nation and the heart of its burgeoning industry, we have the means and the capital to invest in it. Our civilian industry must be bolstered, and our infrastructure must be improved in order to make the city in to a capital that could contend with any in the region."
 VIE_Permit_American_Investments_desc:0 "The glory of the American market - the envy of capitalist nations around the world - is a spectacle to behold, and now we will have our piece of it. American businesses have recognized us as a new partner, and have expressed interest in setting up in our country."
 VIE_Import_American_Tech_desc:0 "Since the war ended, American technological advancement in industrial sectors has improved their capabilities by leaps and bounds. We must make connections with these industries, and hopefully license these new assets."
 VIE_Expand_Rubber_Line_desc:0 "Rubber is the number-one most important exported resource that Vietnam controls, and we must capitalize on this by expanding our boundaries and exploring growth. Ensuring that we can build new rubber plants will be crucial in our goals in bringing in more income and trade."
 VIE_Invest_CEE_Operations_desc:0 "It has become evident to us that the CEE's (Compagnie des Eaux et d'Electricite' de Saigon) equipment in recent years has become outdated, and is in dire need of further investments and modernization which we will now issue."
 VIE_Repair_DaLatThapCham_Railway_desc:0 "The Da Lat-Tham Cham Railway is one of the few railway arteries at our disposal in the south, and it requires constant upkeep in its current state. With new investments and technological improvements, it can be another vital vein in the body of the industrial base."
 VIE_Protect_French_Plantation_Owners_desc:0 "The French plantations of old, having long been stocked and worked by Vietnamese farmers, young children and old men, must now serve us. Though many wish to have the land split up for use by smaller farmers and more families, we must protect the holdings, for they are an important industrial supplier of food."
 VIE_Electrify_Rural_Nam_Phan_desc:0 "The rural regions of Nam-phan have always been backwards and outdated for centuries and largely still are. Thus electrification would be the foundation for further Industrialization and investments in the Region."
 VIE_Repair_SaigonMytho_Railway_desc:0 "The Saigon-Mytho Rail line is quickly becoming an important - and antiquated - way for industry to move the fruits of our labor. Our government has recognized that we should devote some capital to improving or expanding the rail lines to better serve us."
 VIE_Export_Rubber_Natural_Resources_desc:0 "With our new capabilities, we can now increase rubber production and exportation, and our other resources have also caught up with other countries, meaning we can now afford to open up larger trade ports and trading laws."
 
 VIE_Asian_Desk_desc:0 "We have an important role to play in Asian affairs. Although not the largest nation in Asia, we have a spirit and resolve that can easily sway the balance of a conflict. But we must pick carefully how we apply ourselves. We don't want to become overstretched in fixing the problems of all Asian countries."
 VIE_Western_Desk_desc:0 "It's a sad reality that it is difficult to operate in this world without the backing of the West. Although the age of imperialism is supposedly dying, it seems that it is not dying but simply morphing into something new. We need to prep our diplomats so that they can get the Western powers on our side. With their support, we will have their industrial might and diplomatic sway behind our nation, and we will be able to expand our influence worldwide."
 VIE_Demand_Japanese_Deport_CuongDe_desc:0 "It is disturbing enough to know of the efforts of Cuong-De to undermine our government, but it is insulting to know that the Japanese government refused to repudiate his attempts. Utilizing political pressure, we must demand that he be deported back to Vietnam, to answer for himself."
 VIE_Negotiate_Brevet_Lines_desc:0 "The Brevet Lines, the nautical borders that separate Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese claims, have been a point of contention. The Kuomintang has made moves to suggest that they believe they are the rightful owners of Vietnamese islands in the South. This requires us to negotiate with the Cambodians to clarify the border situation."
 VIE_Demand_PhuQuoc_Ownership_desc:0 "The Nationalist Chinese have gone too far, first in posturing that the island of Phu-Quoc is theirs, and now we have seen armed military personnel moving in positions on and nearby the islands. This is far too much for our government to stand by and accept. We must make strong statements to dispel the illusions that the Kuomintang suffer from."
 VIE_PhuQuoc_Launch_Invasion_desc:0 "The time for politics is past. The Kuomintang have ignored all warnings. Our military is prepared to launch a full invasion of the island to take back what is ours. We will not be denied the property we own."
 VIE_Focus_on_Other_Matters_desc:0 "Military action against KMT incursions in the Phu Quoc region is not the major concern, other matters must take more of our time and effort. We will concern ourselves with the border question when we come to it."
 VIE_Regarding_French_Drawn_Borders_desc:0 "In our continuing border disputes with the Nationalist Chinese, we will have to rely and possibly rework the classical borders written by our original colonial overlords. While fair and solid for a long time, now we must rework them and ensure that these pitiful squabbles end."
 VIE_Accept_DeFacto_TranNinh_desc:0 "In an effort to bring peace, we have elected to agree to the borders that the French have drawn up. While we do not feel it punishes the KMT for their efforts against us on our borders, those borders, properly enforced, will work."
 VIE_Claim_TranNinh_desc:0 "With the question of our borders up in the air, we must take the opportunity to claim the region of Tran Ninh, full of villagers and people who identify as Vietnamese, and are more closely connected to us than the Laotians."
 VIE_Pau_Treaty_desc:0 "Our diplomats with the French have committed to finding a breakthrough in negotiating our financial independence, and we have found that our French counterparts are sympathetic to the cause. We will work to ensure that Vietnamese financial freedom is in our hands above all else."
 VIE_Sign_Autonomous_Forex_Agreement_desc:0 "With our agreement with the French, we have on our plate the ability to sign an agreement that will allow us to open the trading and exchanging of currency. Another step in our financial freedom is secured, and Vietnam can finally begin to pull away from our colonial roots."
 VIE_Accept_Foreign_Affairs_Administrative_Duties_desc:0 "We have prepared ourselves well for the prospect of managing our own affairs and the affairs of state elsewhere in the world, and it is time for us to step into the shoes of foreign and internal policymaking. Ensuring our resources and political bounds permit us to do so, we shall begin to carve our own path."
 VIE_Matignon_Treaty_desc:0 "The French have decided to wash their hands completely of Vietnam, and are ready and willing to sign a treaty announcing their total withdrawal from the region. At last, our independence is being assured by the government, and a conference in Matignon will formalize Vietnam's total independence. Freedom has been achieved!"
 VIE_Beg_Crown_Domain_French_Renouncement_desc:0 "Our French allies have inadvertently caused a political headache for us by not outright denouncing or renouncing the hold the crown has on the people up to this point. While France does not see the harm in this, they are in fact creating resistance to our government in areas where royalist beliefs are strong."
 VIE_Korean_War_desc:0 "Korea is embroiled in a conflict similar to our own; a power vacuum has been created, and the evil forces of communism are seeking to sink their teeth into the newly established nation. We must do something to prevent this, but how much can we really spare in our intervention? If we allow South Korea to fall, a domino effect might occur across Asia and new republics like our own might be snuffed out by the menace of Marxism."
 VIE_Korean_Intervention_desc:0 "Our efforts to supply the Korean soldiers in their effort against the communists are not enough. Our national defense administration has committed themselves to preparing an expeditionary force to help solidify the defense of liberty against the Chinese and their North Korean puppets."
 VIE_Accept_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. It is a proposal we cannot turn away from, our goals are aligned and our duty to the world is on full display."
 VIE_Ignore_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. Though interesting, it is not within the goals of our nation to cooperate currently with foreign bodies. Indeed, their interference would only damage our ability to run the war as we see fit."
 VIE_Attract_US_Support_Long_desc:0 "In our effort against our enemies, our greatest ally is the American government. Steadfast maintenance of our government must now involve full cooperation, and the great resources of the United States will give us the edge we need."

 VIE_Greenlight_American_Intervention_desc:0 "America has voiced its willingness to enter the conflict on our side, not content to simply help. With their military might and economic power, we will surely vanquish our enemies in the North and end this bitter conflict."
 VIE_A_Change_in_Course_desc:0 "In order to improve inwards, we must look outwards to our close Asian brothers and see how they have managed their affairs. We must move on from the influences of French affairs in our decisions, and chart our own path."
 VIE_Look_up_to_Japan_desc:0 "The affairs of the Japanese in developing a stable post-war government and their way of government have influenced our way of thinking. It is time for us to consider following their lead more closely, in order to ensure continued success."
 VIE_Allow_Japanese_Investments_desc:0 "Allow Japanese Invesetments"
 VIE_Promote_PanAsianism_desc:0 "Our roots have always been mixed with our Asian brothers, and with the world finally beginning to come together to achieve common goals, it is time for us to enter the world as a positive influence in our global community."

 VIE_Accept_Geneva_Treaty_desc:0 "Our dastardly cruel enemies to the North have fought us to a bitter standstill, and our political allies have us in a corner, saying that we should accept the terms being presented in Geneva that would split our country in two. While we hate this idea with our fullest minds, we cannot deny the war has progressed in a way we cannot guarantee our success. We must bite the bullet and accept the terms."

 VIE_Recognize_NBO_desc:0 ""
 
 VIE_Amalgamatize_VeBinh_Paramilitaries_desc:0 "In order for us to win the conflict, we will need to recruit the paramilitary sects that have, until recently, not been interested in taking a side. Their efforts will help to bring stability and legitimacy to our regime."
 VIE_Recommision_WW_Native_Veterns_desc:0 "Our combat effectiveness only goes as far as our general staff. In order to win the war, we will have to enlist the help of veteran leaders who have fought in the greatest wars of our generation. Their services will ensure our victory in any struggle."
 VIE_Recall_French_ProFrench_Native_Officers_desc:0 "To beat a new enemy, we must make deals with old friends. The French forces and their allies that have been expelled from the country must return, in order to turn the tide against any of our foes."
 VIE_Organize_VoBi_Mil_Academies_desc:0 "Our military tradition is one born in the heat of our conflicts with our oppressors. As such, we have access to some of the best teachers of war in the country, and we can use them to train our next generation of heroes and commanders."

 VIE_Organize_Vietnamese_BoQuocPhong_desc:0 "Our efforts in the countryside have led to the necessity for an organizing of forces and an evaluation of the strategy we have employed. A fresh look from the generals could provide the answers we need."

 VIE_Incorporate_Religious_Sects_BinhXuyen_Forces_desc:0 "In order to gain legitimacy in the South, we most cooperate with entities not totally sympathetic to our cause. The religious sects in the Mekong Delta and the Binh-Xuyen crime syndicate have been a thorn in our side for years, but if we can “convince” them to work with us, we will have gained a powerful ally."
 VIE_Deal_Leroys_Ambitions_desc:0 "It is time to survey the options. The situation with Leroy has reached an impasse, and we may not get another chance to make a decision on what to do."
 VIE_Rescue_PhatDiem_Catholic_Militias_desc:0 "The Catholic Militias in and around the city of Saigon have run into trouble dealing with forces in the area. Helping them will cause issues with the Buddhist population in the region, but it is a tradeoff we must be willing to make in order to retain our hold on the area."
 VIE_Expand_QuanCu_Foundries_desc:0 "With peace achieved in Saigon, we can now begin to work on our economic foundations. The foundries in Quan-cu will be important in revitalizing our military industrial base, and give us an edge over our enemies."

 VIE_Contact_DaiViet_War_Bases_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the Dai-Viet Party and their paramilitaries including the Hung-Viet and Viet-Sinh Doan are organizing and expanding themselves in the following bases: Nguyen-Hue and Chau-Doc. It is our utmost concern to quickly seize their assets and bases for our national protection effort."
 VIE_Organize_Recon_Armored_Battalions_desc:0 "Investing in better and deadlier armaments is paramount in this struggle. We must find a way to bring in heavier equipment ot arm our recon units."
 VIE_Section_Marine_desc:0 "With its long coastline and numerous maritime trade routes, our young nation is in dire need of a dedicated navy to protect its territorial waters and vital sea lanes. This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea. Equipped with modern vessels, patrol boats, and coastal defense assets courtesy of French support, it is our goal to become a renowned force in the turbulent waters of Southeast Asia."
 VIE_Establish_DINA_Units_desc:0 ""

 VIE_Recieve_French_Naval_Equipment_desc:0 ""
 VIE_Section_Air_desc:0 "Vietnam's conflicts have been primarily decided by the power of the air, and we have had issues in the past. Designing and producing our own air power will be difficult, but we can start the process of producing a deadly and formidable air force."
 VIE_Vietnamized_Air_Officer_Corp_desc:0 "The academies we have opened are producing results, and our factories are ready to produce new planes and finally we can begin to fly. The road to start will be rough, but it is a mission we cannot fail at."
 VIE_Recruit_TieuDoan_NhayDu_desc:0 "The use of Paratrooper divisions in war has become a staple, and with our new air capabilities, we must explore the possibilities in making it a critical part of the way we wage war in the Central Highlands."
 VIE_Expand_PhiTruong_QuanSu_NhaTrang_desc:0 "While many former French and British airfields are in our grasp, we must also build our own, and the Nha Trang Valley is the perfect place to launch and coordinate missions."

 VIE_Implement_French_Equipment_Tactics_desc:0 "Our French allies have agreed to send us a massive infusion of weapons and heavy armor, and with these materials, we can begin to turn the jungle into less of an obstacle.

The infusion of new American weapons, and the use of American manufacturing power to produce more equipment for us will be a crucial step in our ability to conduct operations."
 VIE_Implement_Trad_Tactics_desc:0 "The tactics of old often are not the tactics of the present, but the French do not understand the field of play. We have been fighting in this place since the dawn of time, and we know the land and the way the land plays into our hand better than anyone, and we will use that to destroy our enemies."
 VIE_Encourage_Homemade_Arms_desc:0 "This war is one made from the seeds of convenience, and the people have been forced to become creative with their abilities to defend their homes. We must encourage these actions in order to slow the progress of our enemy in the countryside."
 VIE_Expand_Territoire_Autonome_Battalions_desc:0 "The best bet for security in the countryside is to bolster the strength of our forces. In the Native Lands, many militias and warlord forces can be recruited to our cause. Their support will lead us to victory in the countryside."

 VIE_Modernize_Autonomous_Armies_Orgs_desc:0 "With the advancement of our own military strength, it would make sense to consider doing the same with our warlord allies. Providing them with arms and equipment to keep them up to date will help us fight our enemies."
 VIE_Incorporate_Irregular_Units_desc:0 "As the war goes on, the irregular forces of the tribal groups in the countryside have grown stronger. Now, with the war intensifying, we must draw from their strength again in order to fight off the enemy's influence from the countryside."
 VIE_Perfect_Guerrilla_War_desc:0 "Our enemies have used it, but we will be the ones to perfect it. Understanding how to control the battlefield at large, from the hamlets to the jungle floors, will be crucial in the way that we will win conflicts in our homeland, and it will cost a country everything to dare attack us."
 VIE_Section_Air_Irregular_desc:0 "The French Planes in service here were very successful at their operations, and we must acquire them to train our future pilots. We must also get advisors to help us train the new generation of air commanders."

 VIE_Ignore_China_desc:0 "Regardless of whichever side wins in the civil war, China will still pose a threat against us for years to come. It would be best for us to focus on our internal affair rather than worry about Chinese affairs."

It's time to put this unhappy divorce into question as our people are starting to become more and more vocal about a potential restart to the Unification reconquest “Bac-tien“  as since the union with the Southern province of Vietnam? There haven't been any additional efforts to pressure the North into accepting Bao-dai's dream of a unified Vietnam!"
 VIE_Wait_It_Out_desc:0 "We are not ready yet, not now and not in the short term foreseeable future. They are well dug in and highly fanatical to the Marxist lies. We'll need to consider all available options of approach with the end goal of the unification not turning into a national disaster."
 VIE_Prepare_Army_desc:0 "The time has come and the Northern Liberation “bac-tien“ of our nation is in front of us. The government has put out publications mobilizing all conscripts and calling for all militias and religious sects to turn their gaze up north. Unification is soon upon us and the communist demons will be annihilated!"

 VIE_Rebuild_BaoDai_Image_desc:0 ""
 VIE_Tighten_Noose_On_Western_Journalism_desc:0 "The pen is mightier than the sword, and so we need to regulate it just like any other weapon. We can't have “ journalists “ wielding and invent dangerous fictions against our government. From today, the government will take a guiding hand in ensuring that the news is more 'factual'. Most importantly, we will ensure that corrupted journalists who are being paid to undermine government work do not get the front page or any page for any matters at all!"
 VIE_Legalize_Casinos_Prostitutions_desc:0 "Our country's culture is relatively conservative, so opening casinos and allowing prostitution might seem like a bad idea… but it also sounds like a fun one. With these new industries, we will open a valuable new income stream for the government. We know that many of these things happen. Whether it is illegal or not, we might as well profit from it. This way, we can build our own gambling industry in Saigon with blackjack and hookers. "
 VIE_Erase_Sex_Scandels_PayOff_Debts_desc:0 "It's not easy being a leader; every day, there is pressure to make the right decision, and everybody lets you know when you make a mistake. So it's no wonder that we like to gamble a bit and enjoy the company of beautiful companions. Unfortunately, the public doesn't understand the stress of power, and if word got out about our 'excesses', then we could have a serious crisis. We can use our power to lean on any investigative journalists delving into the president's personal life; the only stories about the leader will be him helping old ladies cross the street, not using prostitutes. We can also tap the wealthy beneficiaries of our economic policies for 'donations' to help pay off our mounting debts. Our virtuous image must be preserved!"
 VIE_Expand_Grande_Monde_Casino_desc:0 "People love to gamble; not only our people but visitors from abroad are arriving to lose their hard-earned money in our casinos. The Grande-Monde casino is not only making record profits, but it is also is the largest currently in Southeast Asia; the time has come to expand the main hall of the casino. We will collaborate with our 'good friend' Le-Van-Vien to add new games and more bars to the building. As well as this, there will be a number of beautiful decorations brought in by renowned world class designers. We will have a casino that rivals anything in Asia!"

Saigon will be that city, a pleasure city where money washes in endlessly. We can build a city that the rest of Asia will marvel at. With a little investment and the continued success of our casino business, Saigon will be the Paris of Indochina. We have taken the first step, and now, we must just stay the course."

 #Country Events
 
 Elysee_Accords.1.d:0 "At the Elysee Palace in the distant land of France, a historic agreement has been reached that will forever change the future of the millions of citizens within our territory. Our young nation recognized internationally as the State of Vietnam shall be granted greater independence from France within the multi continental system of the French Union, a momentous accomplishment that was the culmination of months of hard work by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai. The Elysee Accords will now move to the French National Assembly, to be officially ratified and signed by the French president.\n\nThe accords stated that Vietnam could now conduct its own foreign affairs, control its finances and have an army. Specifically, we were granted the right to appoint diplomats to China, Thailand, and the Vatican City, but the remainder of our foreign policy will remain under French guidance. Some may decry this as falling short of granting complete independence, but the matter of fact is that this was the best we could have got, especially in such turbulent times where pushing our French benefactors away would be complete suicide."
 CCC_Unification_Choices.1.d:0 "Earlier today, our Head-of-State Bao-Dai landed in Saigon after a short flight from Da-Lat. His arrival there signified a major step towards our reunification efforts with Cochinchina, for the former emperor was personally leading negotiations while also enjoying considerable French backing. The recent passing of a bill declaring Cochinchina to no longer be a direct French territory but instead part of the State of Vietnam in the French Assembly was a significant milestone that allowed our Head-of-State a comfortable position to leverage. With that in mind, Bao-Dai guided the subsequent negotiations…"
 CCC_Unification_Choices.2.d:0 "Printed on the front page of all major newspapers this morning was a grand proclamation personally written by our Head-of-State Bao-Dai, requesting peace and unity among his people and announcing the upcoming plans for unification with Cochinchina. Intrigued citizens flocked to stores to buy copies and take a close look at the former emperor's words. After much deliberation and discussion, the general consensus among them was that Bao-Dai's writing was rather…"
 CCC_Unification.1.d:0 "Despite our best attempts, it seems that our efforts to try and unify the 'Republic' of Cochinchina have failed. Despite the 'warm' relations between General Nguyen-Van-Xuan and Head of State Bao-Dai, the two cannot agree on a plausible solution to the country's problems. There are rumours that Nguyen-Van-Xuan is holding out for a different leader or, at the very least, a different solution and is stalling negotiations to unify. Bao-Dai has made the decision to appeal directly to the French. However, this may compromise the 'Purity' of his diplomatic victory; it is believed that with their pressure, the remaining holdouts on unification will be forced to agree."
 CCC_Unification.2.d:0 "The Head of State of Vietnam, Bao-Dai, has reached an impasse and requested our support to unify his country. As in many other cases, it seems that Bai-Dai's bark is worse than his bite. Fortunately, the main holdout to unification is Nguyen-Van-Xuan, who is loyal to us; with a certain amount of 'pressure,' he can likely be persuaded to unify. Unifying the country might make it strong enough to start pulling its own weight in this struggle and put less pressure on our boys to sort things out. The question is whether we should continue to support Bao-Dai or if it's time for fresh blood."
 CCC_Unification.3.d:0 "Besides Bao-Dai's government, we have also received request from the French government for us to unite with Bao-Dai's government. Similarly, we could heed to the French request for us to join Bao-Dai's government provide that Bao-Dai follows some terms and conditions or we could refuse to join and remain an autonomous republic. However, refusing to join Bao-Dai's government would mean that Bao-Dai could take Cochinchina by force."
 CCC_Unification.4.d:0 "Great news has been delivered to our government recently. Our diplomatic office in Cochinchina, which is being dismantled as we speak, has just received confirmation that the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina has ceased to exist as a political entity, and instead has become integral provinces of the State of Vietnam. Our Head-of-State Bao-Dai was reported to be personally elated at this development, and there has been considerable celebration in the streets. Without a doubt, this accomplishment will further entrench our legitimacy and improve our image in the eyes of the people."
 CCC_Unification.5.d:0 "Devastating news has just been delivered to our government today. Despite our best efforts, our diplomatic office in Cochinchina will have to stay open for a little bit longer, for we have received an insulting refusal from a representative of Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina, stating that they would not submit to the authority of what they called “the incompetent fools of the State of Vietnam.” Our Head-of-State Bao-Dai was described to be extremely outraged when he heard of this development, who then proceeded to storm out of his quarter to contact the French and request immediate intervention. Riots and unrest have enveloped our streets, as citizens flock downtown to protest what they deemed to be governmental incompetence. This is undoubtedly a major strike to our legitimacy, and it will take a long time to rebuild our image."
 CCC_Unification.6.d:0 "With the recent negotiation between Cochinchina and Bao-Dai's government, we have received another request from Bao-Dai again regarding the unification of Cochinchina and Annam. Bao-Dai demands us again to unify Cochinchina and Annam under one government to ensure the stability of Vietnam. Considering our situation in Vietnam right now, it is best for us to heed Bao-Dai's words and 'persuade' Cochinchina to unify with Annam under a single Vietnamese government friendly to us."
 CCC_Unification.7.d:0 "We have received the final ultimatum from France regarding the topic of unification of Cochinchina and Annam under a single Vietnamese government. It seems that the French is now pressuring us to unite with Bao-Dai's government considering that Bao-Dai threaten to invade us if we refuse peaceful unification. We could cave to Bao-Dai's demand to ensure peace among the Vietnamese people or we could put our foot down and refuse to his demand and fight to our last breath. Beware that if we refuse Bao-Dai's term to unify, the French will not come to our defense if he sends his army against us."
 CCC_Unification.8.d:0 "It is natural that our glorious leader Bao-Dai would attract Cochinchina to the State of Vietnam. General Nguyen-Van-Xuan has great respect, as he should, for the hegemony of Bao-Dai over all of Vietnam is just, promising, and natural. Bao-Dai is the greatest leader our nation ever had, in its thousands of years of history. His diplomatic skills, economic acumen, and commanding personality means he is unstoppable, and will surely crush the northern communist threat.\n\nThe unification of Cochinchina with our Central Provisional Government will lead us to unequivocal greatness. Nguyen-Van-Xuan understands that under a superior centralised government, we can defeat the communists and bring about a proper modern Vietnamese state."
 CCC_Unification.9.d:0 "General Nguyen-Van-Xuan has blighted the country by not accepting the unification of our lands with his occupied Cochinchina. His reluctance to band together to fight the northern communist threat will surely be a stain on Vietnam for many years to come. He claims that our former king Bao-Dai is unfit to rule because of controversies in Saigon, but these “justification” are not enough to make Bao-Dai resign or stop wanting the best of the Vietnamese people. He carries a heavy weight on his back and it is no surprise or crime for him to indulge in human pleasures. As for Nguyen-Van-Xuan, it is expected that a French sympathiser would be so greedy and power hungry. The people, and the world, will understand Bao-Dai's hegemony over all of Vietnam is justified and necessary."
 CCC_Unification.10.d:0 "Recently, Bao-Dai has arrived in Saigon to demonstrate that he has unified Cochinchina and Annam under his government. While this means that Cochinchina is lost to us for now as our troops are outnumbered by the French and their lackeys, we must not give up our dream on reunifying Vietnam. We must not stop this war until Vietnam is liberated from the imperialist!"
 Initial_CuongDe.1.d:0 "Gia-Long, first Emperor of the Nguyen dynasty, experienced the devastating tragedy of outliving his own eldest son, Prince Nguyen-Phuc-Canh, who did leave behind a son prior to his death. Despite that, the throne was passed to Gia-Long's fourth son, Minh-Mang, ancestor of our current Head-of-State Bao-Dai. But the past has come back to haunt us once more, for Cuong-De, descendant of Prince Canh, has become quite a thorn in our side by utilizing his heritage to further his personal political goals.\n\nEducated in Japan, Cuong-De was a key figure in the Dong Du (On the Way to the East) movement, which sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. Facing much persecution from the French, he still nonetheless evaded capture and found the Viet-Nam Quang-Phuc Hoi (Vietnam Restoration Organisation) alongside Phan-Boi-Chau in 1911, hoping to overthrow French colonial rule in Vietnam and establish a democratic republic. The organization failed to gain momentum, crippled by arrests of its members. Cuong-De did not give up, however, and later created the Viet-Nam Phuc-quoc Dong-minh Hoi (League for the Restoration of Vietnam) in 1938 and attempted to court Japanese support.\n\nNow that order has been restored to our country and the French has returned, Cuong-De's ambitions can not be left unchecked any longer. Having given a public press conference declaring his intent to return to Vietnam and form an opposition to our government, we must make sure that this illegitimate upstart does not gain any further influence. Proposals personally drafted by Bao-Dai will be sent to major foreign powers like France and the United States requesting that they ignore Cuong-De, while a diplomatic protest will be issued to Japan for hosting him as a citizen."
 Initial_CuongDe.2.d:0 "We have received news from the Vietnamese government requesting us to ignore Prince Cuong-De's letter. Considering that Prince Cuong-De has desires to free Vietnam from colonialism while having pro-Japanese sympathy, we could follow the request and ignore his letter if we want to keep our hold in Vietnam or we can support Cuong-de for him to become dependent on us rather than the incompetent Bao-Dai."
 Initial_CuongDe.3.d:0 "His Excellency, Bao-Dai, has launched a vicious attack against our government for harbouring the “traitor“ Cuong-De. In a scathing rebuke to the accusations made by Cuong-De, the Head of State Bao-Dai has stated that we are merely using Cuong-De as a tool to undermine his rule. Bao-Dai has restated embarrassing revelations about Cuong-De's countless past failure to liberate Vietnam and his collaboration during the Second World War have invalidated any claim to rule in Vietnam. It is believed that the statements being made by Cuong-De might be stirring up popular support in Vietnam, and the Vietnamese government is in a frenzy that Cuong-De could end their rule. The Vietnamese ambassador has emphasised that continuing to host Cuong-De will damage relations and could even lead to an embargo. The French have also expressed frustration with the statements of Cuong-De accusing him of undermining efforts to restore order in Vietnam. Cuong-De has made several requests to be returned to Vietnam to further the nationalist cause, however, it is not clear how we could repatriate him. Some in our intelligence agency have suggested attempting to smuggle him across the border."
 Initial_CuongDe.4.d:0 "Prince Cuong-De has recently declared his intent on returning to Vietnam to reclaim his position as the Emperor of Vietnam as a descendant of Prince Nguyen-Phuc-Canh. While this can spell trouble for the Bao-Dai government, only time will tell whether Cuong-De will succeed in his goal or not."
 Initial_CuongDe.5.d:0 "Reports have it that Prince Cuong-De is on his way to Vietnam from Tokyo via Hong Kong and Bangkok in disguise. He's planning to sneak into Vietnam by going through the Hong Kong-Bangkok route. Let us make a plan on intercepting him at Bangkok and see if we could foil his plot to overthrow Bao-Dai."
 Initial_CuongDe.6.d:0 "While at Bangkok, agents have spotted Prince Cuong-De in disguise. It seems that the prince disguises himself as a Chinese man with a fake passport. With the prince near their grasp, the agents commence their action to arrest him, and the result is ..."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.1.d.a:0 "Recently, our great leader Bao-Dai made an overture in Saigon in an effort to reunify Cochinchina and Annam under one government. For years, our government faces many problems across the nation such as an incompetent colonial administration, religious paramilitary groups, bandits, and a nationwide Communist insurgency from North to South. Despite these problems, Bao-Dai managed to unify Cochinchina and Annam under his rule under our new state, the State of Vietnam, or État du Viêt-Nam in French. Since Bao-Dai unified these two regions under our new government, he hopes to gain more autonomy from France by gaining control of the other Crown domains of Vietnam and destroying communism once and for all."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.1.d.b:0 "Recently, our great leader Bao-Dai and his army marched into Saigon in an effort to reunify Cochinchina and Annam under one government. For years, our government faces many problems across the nation such as an incompetent colonial administration, religious paramilitary groups, bandits, and a nationwide Communist insurgency from North to South. Despite these problems, Bao-Dai managed to unify Cochinchina and Annam under his rule under our new state, the State of Vietnam, or État du Viêt-Nam in French. Since Bao-Dai unified these two regions under our new government, he hopes to gain more autonomy from France by gaining control of the other Crown domains of Vietnam and destroying communism once and for all."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.2.d:0 ""With Bao-Dai's recent takeover of Cochinchina and the formation of the State of Vietnam, we have two options on how to handle this issue. We could recognize Bao-Dai's government as the legitimate government of Vietnam and begin diplomatic relation or we could refuse due to the current instability in Vietnam. Accepting Bao-Dai's government as the legitimate government of Vietnam would allow us to conduct diplomatic relation and gain new allies in Southeast Asia. However, Bao-Dai's government might not be the most reliable as an ally, so we need to be careful with our choice here."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.3.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, Bao-Dai has declared us as "Demonic Communists" that needs to be wiped from the Earth as soon as possible. We decided to scoff at his words considering his status as nothing more than a French lackey oppressing the people. We must continue on our goal of liberation of Vietnam from North to South from the imperialist power once and for all."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.4.t.a:0 "Nguyen-Van-Xuan Is Elected Deputy Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam"
 Etat_du_Vietnam.4.t.b:0 "Bao-Dai Remains as Sole Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam"
 Etat_du_Vietnam.4.d.a:0 "With the peaceful unification of Cochinchina and Annam, let us elect Nguyen-Van-Xuan as our Prime Minister. With his expertise as the former governor of Cochinchina, he could provide us the legitimacy that we need to the western world that we are a worthy democratic nation. Nguyen-Van-Xuan's former position as the head of the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina could also prove useful in helping us keeping Cochinchina under our control."
 Etat_du_Vietnam.4.d.b:0 "With the unification of Cochinchina and Annam, Bao-Dai shall remain as the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam until the next election. With Bao-Dai's leadership, we should expect a hardline stance against the Communists in Vietnam. However, Bao-Dai's hedonistic lifestyle attracts criticism from the people, which will make control of Vietnam difficult. As the sole leader of the State of Vietnam, Bao-Dai now needs to handle his position with care, lest the nation falls to Communism again."
 VIE_PMs.1.d:0 "Grave news, my great leaders! It seems that Nguyen-Van-Xuan has resigned his position as Prime Minister. For now, Bao-Dai will remain in charge of the nation until he can find another Deputy Prime Minister. One candidate Bao-Dai have in mind for the Deputy Prime Minister position is Nguyen-Phan-Long. Nguyen-Phan-Long's Cao Dai's faith, pro-American foreign policy, and nationalist domestic policy should appeal to fellow Caodaist, those that want a closer relation with America, and nationalists in our nation."
 VIE_PMs.2.d:0 "Despite Nguyen-Phan-Long's best attempt to govern the nation, it seems that he has earned the ire of the French and now Bao-Dai has to force Phan-Long to resign. With Phan-Long no longer the Prime Minister, Bao-Dai will fill in his place for now until he can find someone else to fill in the position of Prime Minister."

 BaoDai.4.d:0 "On the 6th of June 1949, a significant development unfolded as the French Secret Police, known as 'Xac-Te,' directly contacted our government to deliver a grave warning about the peril posed by Ngo-Dinh-Diem, whom they branded a traitor. Their concerns centered on Diem's latest manifesto, which had just been published in our newspapers. This piece contained deeply unsettling and radical ideas, with the apparent intent of sowing the seeds of rebellion among our populace, urging them to rise against both our fledgling government and our French benefactors.\n\nThe Chief of Security at Xac-Te emphasized that prompt action should have been taken to remove Diem from the equation, underscoring the potential threat posed by his Christian Social Movement. The fear was that if allowed to continue, Diem could inflict further damage upon our government's struggle against the encroaching specter of northern communism and disrupt the fragile stability we sought to maintain.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Diem's manifesto, which sheds light on his ideological stance:\n\n"We must recognize that our current struggle extends beyond mere political independence for our homeland. It is, in essence, a SOCIALIST REVOLUTION, aimed at securing FREEDOM for the FARMERS AND WORKERS OF VIETNAM! Our ultimate objective is to ensure that every individual in Vietnam possesses the means of production, enabling them to lead lives of dignity. To achieve this, I advocate for progressive and bold social reforms that will not only safeguard our human dignity but also usher in an era of growth and evolution."\n\nThe urgency of the situation is undeniable, and the need to rectify our course is immediate."

 NgoDinh_Brothers.1.d:0 "Reports have reached the French Secret Police 'Xac-Te' that Ngo-Dinh-Diem, the elusive figure behind the controversial manifesto, has managed to escape capture. Intelligence suggests that Diem has found refuge in Japan, further complicating our efforts to contain his radical agenda.\n\nRecent intelligence intercepts also indicate that Diem has had a clandestine meeting with Cuong-De, a prominent figure known for his involvement in anti-government activities. This meeting, shrouded in secrecy, hints at a potential alliance between two forces with similar aims but differing methods.\n\nCuong-De's involvement raises concerns about the depth of collaboration among various factions seeking to challenge our government's stability and French support. Diem's continued presence on the international stage, coupled with this newfound alliance, adds another layer of complexity to the evolving situation.\n\nXac-Te remains vigilant, monitoring these developments closely and assessing the implications of this unexpected meeting. As we strive to safeguard our nation against the communist threat, this new alliance could prove to be a formidable challenge in the days to come."
 NgoDinh_Brothers.2.d:0 "The tables have turned as Ngo-Dinh-Diem, the mastermind behind the controversial manifesto that has shaken our government, has been apprehended by the vigilant French Secret Police 'Xac-Te.' This development marks a significant milestone in our battle against Diem's radical agenda and a possible turning point in our fight for stability.\n\nDiem's arrest, carried out with precision, has sparked speculation about his fate and the consequences he might face for attempting to incite a socialist revolution in Vietnam. In response to his capture, Diem has unleashed a barrage of venomous tirades, vowing revenge against what he perceives as imperialists and collaborators who have sold our country's sovereignty.\n\nFrom his cell, Diem has declared his unwavering commitment to liberating Vietnam from the influence of foreign powers. He alleges that his arrest is part of a broader conspiracy to stifle the voice of the Vietnamese people seeking true independence and dignity. His fiery rhetoric has gained traction among sympathizers, setting the stage for potential unrest in the nation."
 NgoDinh_Brothers.3.d:0 "Ngo-Dinh-Nhu, the brother of the notorious Ngo-Dinh-Diem, has been arrested by the French Secret Police 'Xac-Te' on charges of conspiracy against the government and incitement to revolt. Nhu's arrest was carried out swiftly and discreetly by Xac-Te agents. His alleged involvement in the dissemination of the communist manifesto authored by Diem has fueled speculation about the depth of their collusion in a radical agenda.\n\nIn response to his brother's arrest, Diem, known for his charismatic leadership, has fled the country, seeking refuge in Japan. From an undisclosed location, he has issued a passionate proclamation, vowing to liberate his brother and the nation from what he perceives as imperialism's clutches. He alleges that Nhu's arrest is a grave injustice, a suppression of their cause to bring freedom and dignity to the people of Vietnam.\n\nDiem's rhetoric remains inflammatory and has caught the attention of sympathetic factions both within and beyond our borders. His flight to Japan promises to be the beginning of a new problem that will undoubtedly continue to be a thorn at our side."
 
 VIE_Econ_SelfDem.1.d:0 "Our great leader Bao-Dai has been taking steps towards convincing our French benefactors to grant Vietnam its rightful economic independence. Their waning control means that seizing the opportunity is much easier, and as such Bao-Dai has elected to, through his masterful diplomacy, ask the French to decentralise their grasp on our lands by allowing us to directly control all of our major industries and investments. Although this may seem like a form of submission and acknowledgement of French hegemony, it is in fact one of the first steps to creating a glorious independent Vietnam.\n\nBao-Dai has organised a course of action for when the French inevitably accept his proposal, and plans to develop even more of the country which he has made flourish."
 VIE_Econ_SelfDem.2.d:0 "The leader of Vietnam, Bao-Dai, has humbly requested more economic independence. Despite their friendly approach to this diplomacy, there are somewhat threatening undertones, given our struggling post-war economy. We control their key industries and a lot of investments, though it may still be wise to let them have more autonomy, lest we risk tension that we cannot afford."
 
 VIE_JAP.1.d:0 "We have received news from the Vietnamese government denouncing our intent to host Prince Cuong-De in Japan. Since Prince Cuong-De has been a friend of Japan with intents on freeing Vietnam from French colonialism, it would be best for us to ignore any requests of attempting to send him back to Vietnam."
 VIE_JAP.2.d:0 "Prince Cuong-De has come to us with a proposal to restore him as the rightful ruler of Vietnam by means of economic aids. We could gladfully accept our old ally and send him the aids he needs in exchange of bringing him back to Vietnam or we could refuse as we would get into more troubles against France and America."
 Brevert_Lines.1.d:0 "A communication has arrived from Saigon from the President of Vietnam, asking us to consider attending a summit to finalize our ongoing border dispute on maritime limits. In question is the island of Phu-Quoc, which is home to a small KMT exile force and is otherwise fairly small, but its position is vitally important, and abandoning our claim may shake the public perception of our government.\n\nAlternatively, abandoning a claim to a largely small and unneeded island they already administer would go a long way to reducing tensions, and may pave the way for future cooperation with South Vietnam."
 Brevert_Lines.2.d:0 "A great success! Following their attendance at the summit, Cambodia has agreed to abandon their claim on Phu-Quoc and Tho-Chu islands and has completely withdrawn all diplomatic reservations to our continued administration, this has also allowed us to finalize our other border disagreements with them and will see a lasting peace between our two countries."
 Brevert_Lines.3.d:0 "As usual, the Khmer government has stalled and refused to attend the conference citing that, “This conference directly violated their sovereignty and sacred ancestral lands”. While we already administer and control the state, not even common sense can be counted on in global politics. Since this line also decides other aspects of our border, plans are in place to redeploy forces there if we can end this rebellion, and perhaps make them think twice of unwarranted aggression."
 VIE_LeRoy.1.d:0 "Jean LeRoy, one of the notable leaders of the UMDC forces, is known for his militia to protect local Christians against Communist forces. While Leroy may share our causes in fighting against Communism, he is also known for his brutal tactics, which could jeopardize our foreign relations. We could recruit him and use his expertise in the counterinsurgency against the Communist or we could ignore him by sending him to Ben-Tre. Either choices that we make will have consequences for us in the future."
 VIE_PQC.1.d:0 "A formal statement has arrived from Vietnam, and its tone is aggressive. They've demanded we immediately cede the disputed territory of Phu-Quoc and its surrounding islands to their administration, claiming it's vital to the war effort and is recognized by the West as “rightful Vietnamese's possession.” The Generals want to know what our response will be."
 VIE_PQC.2.d:0 "According to our local forces, the government of South Vietnam has gone around our backs and sent an ultimatum to our forces on Phu Quoc demanding their withdrawal and a ceding of the island to them."
 VIE_PQC.3.d:0 "Thankfully it seems as though reason and logic have persevered, we've received a response from Phu-Quoc indicating they would vacate the island to our government almost immediately. Our bureaucrats will be arriving shortly to set up the civilian government and we are making preparations to construct a large prison complex for captured NVA soldiers."
 VIE_PQC.4.d:0 "Sadly the forces on Phu-Quoc were not willing to see reason and have rejected our demands to withdraw from an island that belongs to us! The only option is a military one. A small expeditionary army has been prepared and is awaiting the green light to launch the invasion."

 VIE_KOR.1.d:0 "Across the sea, a fellow anti-communist state in the form of the Republic of Korea is embroiled in a war for survival against the expansionist red menace in the North, and we must assist fellow anti-communist struggles. That said, sending assistance to the South could weaken our domestic forces in the event of a Northern Invasion of the South."
 VIE_KOR.2.d:0 "With the continuing threat of North Korea, we need to be careful about allowing yet more communist nations in Asia, since it could very easily lead to our downfall. As such, we will be formally proposing that we lead an invasion of North Vietnam led by Korean forces. The South would likely support this and would send their forces, and a victory in North Vietnam would prevent the rise of communism in the SEA region.\n\nThe invasion would see formal deployment of the Korean defense forces, as well as involvement of the air force to provide bombardment, and diplomatic overtures to Washington and Taipei to ensure their support in the event other powers decide to get involved, but the risk is low of their intervention, and the administration and army supports the effort."
 VIE_KOR.3.d:0 "South Korea has approached us with an interesting proposal, potentially allowing a rapid victory in our ongoing dispute with the North Vietnamese. President [KOR.GetLeader] has approached our government and offered to join us in a war against the North Vietnamese state, centered around direct intervention forces of the Korean Army consisting of 3 Expeditionary Divisions. It would also see land-based invasions with the North and involvement of the Korean Air Force."
 VIE_KOR.4.d:0 "Despite the associated risks with a pre-emptive invasion of North Vietnam, the Vietnamese Chief of State agreed to our plan and mobilized his army to the border. Time is against us here, and the relevant preparations are already complete, at the word of our President, we go to war to aid our fellow Asian brothers against the Reds."
 VIE_KOR.5.d:0 "Rather annoyingly, South Vietnam has declined the offer out of hand, claiming that an early war with the North would be far too risky, especially with the possibility of intervention of other nations like Communist China and the Soviet Union. For now, they seem to be shifting their policy towards the Americans but are continuing war preparations either way."
 Crown_Domains.1.d:0 "The Crown Domains are autonomous regions of Vietnam under the jurisdiction of local chieftains of the Northwest and the Central Highland. These regions exist to protect French interest and limit Vietnamese migration to the area. Since we're currently at war with the Communist, we have receive a request from Bao-Dai's government to transfer the Crown Domains to them in exchange for their help in the war against the Communists."
 Crown_Domains.2.d:0 "Great news, our glorious leader! The French has accepted our request to annex the rest of the Crown Domains that are not under Communist control. With the Crown Domain under our control once again, we are closer than ever to the unification of Vietnam."
 Crown_Domains.3.d:0 "Tragic news! The French refused our request to hand over the Crown Domains to us. Despite our best to convince them that transfering the Crown Domains would be their only hope for us to aid them against the Communist, they still deny us our rightful claim to the Crown Domains. Since the French refuses to hand us the Crown Domains, we shall deny them any chances of victory against the Communists."

 VIE_USA_Support.1.d:0 "Our attention as of recently has been focused on the ongoing situations in China and Korea, and yet another country in south-east Asia has approached us for assistance. The State of Vietnam, a former French colonial state, has been facing a communist insurgency internally, and a full-scale war from the North Vietnamese state backed by the Soviets. Such an entanglement would likely not take long, and we can predict a rapid collapse of North Vietnam if we were to throw our weight behind the South.\n\nThe Chief of State and Prime Minister have yet to make any requests of us, but the Pentagon is advising us to ready provision of military equipment, and possibly prepare air and ground forces to get formally involved in the event of Northern aggression towards the South."
 VIE_USA_Support.2.d:0 "With the outbreak of hostilities within Vietnam, the South Vietnamese government has once again approached us asking for assistance. This varies from financial and industrial assistance, military advisors, logistical help with bombing and air campaigns, equipment for VNA, and even direct military assistance. The Pentagon is discussing the issue now, but it's quite obvious that not assisting an anti-communist regime against the rising red menace would be dangerous."
 CuongDe.1.d:0 "Recently, news of Prince Cuong-De's arrival in Tay-Ninh did not remain unnoticed by the Vietnamese government. It seems that Cuong-De's arrival in Tay-Ninh has rallied many Cao-Dai and non-Caodaist supporters alike against Bao-Dai's government. Bao-Dai can choose to act now to snuff any chance of Cuong-De retaking the imperial throne or ignore this problem for now since the nation is still at war."
 CuongDe.2.d:0 "With the popularity of Prince Cuong-De and his promises to free Vietnam from French colonial rule on the rise, the Xac-Te has warned Bao-Dai of the potential this can pose on his government. There are even unconfirmed rumors of the prince himself seeking foreign supports from Britain and America. If Bao-Dai does not act soon, there will be consequences for his inaction and his government might not last long."
 CuongDe.3.d:0 ""
 CuongDe.4.d:0 "Despite all of the plannings, it seems that Prince Cuong-De fails to outmaneuver Bao-Dai in the power struggle of Vietnam. With this failure, Prince Cuong-De's chance of reclaiming the imperial throne has vanished and the only thing left for him is a life in exile. Prince Cuong-De is planning to flee to Tokyo, where he resides during his time in exile."

 VIE_Sect_Militias.1.d:0 "In the middle of the night, several French high colonial command staff enter a utilitarian building that stands amidst lush, tropical vegetation, and the building's exterior shows signs of wear from the humid climate and occasional rain. Inside, the meeting room where the officers and Vietnamese staff members are gathered exudes an atmosphere of seriousness and tension. The room is adorned with functional furniture, such as a long wooden table and simple chairs. The walls are adorned with maps of the region and photographs of key military figures, one of them specifically being Phan-van-Giao's.\n\nThe atmosphere is palpably tense as the officers and staff members grapple with the urgent and rising threat of the nationalistic militia group known as the Bao Dai. A relatively mature formation of paramilitaries who had fought both for and against the Japanese oppression, but most importantly, they fought the French on every step they took. The Vietnamese staff discuss the matter with hushed voices, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The weight of responsibility and the potential consequences of their decisions hang heavy in the air, giving the room an almost suffocating feeling. Finally, the voice of a French officer broke the tense silence with a concerned tone: "We can't ignore the threat posed by this nationalistic, monarchist, militia group. They are well-armed and well-trained, and their return is certainly alarming."\n\nOutside the building, the sounds of the bustling military camp can be heard, with soldiers training, vehicles moving, and orders being barked together with the occasional dog bark. After one of those said dogs bark, a second French Officer continues with a well-put-out tone, "Agreed, their history of fighting against us makes their integration into the Vietnamese army a delicate decision as well as a difficult state of cooperation between our forces and theirs."\n\nThe humid air carries a mix of aromas, including the scent of sweat, foliage, and the faint smell of gunpowder from recent drills fills the nostrils of the high echelons of people present at this meeting. A complicated environment for complicated people and this was reflected by the following response by a Vietnamese commander, "But if we don't integrate them, they could become a destabilizing force, and arresting them might just escalate the situation further. Yet at the same time, integrating them could provide valuable insights into their motives and future actions."\n\nLowering his voice, he leans into the ear of the Vietnamese Chief of Staff so that the French would not pry on this rather sensible topic, "Remember, they are our people and they fought for our independence, regardless of our different views. There might be common ground for reconciliation." Finally, the Vietnamese army commander lifts his head and looks at the ever-suspicious French generals and comments with a calculated tone. "We must assess the risks and benefits." The French all give each other a look before one of the officers decisively comments "We should." Yet they have not come to any decision as of now. For? They have locked their eyes at the Vietnamese Chief of Staff who has been silent all this time. Waiting for his input, the tension density in the air grows to an almost palpable degree, but just before it has reached the boiling point, he spoke,"
 VIE_PQC_Mil.1.d:0 "In the wake of our Civil War defeat and our subsequent, albeit temporary, relocation to the Taiwan base of operations, our forces have been strategically positioned in various key locations. These deployments were made in anticipation of a potential return to our homeland. Among these, a notable contingent, nearly 33,000 troops under the command of General Huang Chieh, interned themselves on the South Vietnamese island of Phu Quoc. Apart from these forces, our troops have also maintained a presence in Burma.\n\nSince their deployment, these troops have largely remained stationed in Phu Quoc but have since planned to return home. The ongoing conflict in Vietnam presents considerable risks for these forces to rejoin us, as any movement would necessitate navigating through waters controlled by the NVA and PRC or undertaking a difficult alternative route. Amidst these challenging circumstances, the South Vietnamese government has extended an intriguing proposal. They seek our army's engagement in their conflict against the Marxists in the North. Engaging our forces in this manner could significantly impact the advance of communism, a prospect that is currently under intense deliberation. It is also anticipated that such a move would likely receive support from the American side.\n\nGeneral Huang Chieh, who has been operating semi-autonomously, has yet to be informed of this proposal. We stand at a crossroads with the power to either advance this idea or dismiss it before it reaches the General. The decision presents two distinct options:"
 VIE_PQC_Mil.2.d:0 "It is with regret that we must announce the Republic of China's decision to reject the proposal for integration aimed at countering the North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese forces. The decision was made swiftly, with the Republic citing strategic necessities as the primary reason. They have emphasized the importance of retaining their troops for their operations, a stance that leaves us in a position where we must consider alternative strategies for reinforcing our numbers."
 VIE_PQC_Mil.3.d:0 "We have recently received important communication from two sources; our government in Taiwan and the office of the President of Vietnam in Saigon. Both messages pertain to a significant proposal from President [VIE.GetLeader] of South Vietnam. This proposal involves the integration of our forces into the South Vietnamese army as a semi-autonomous unit. Our primary role would be to assist in their ongoing campaign against the communist forces in the North. This opportunity, while not without risks, presents a compelling chance to halt the advance of the communists on the Indochinese peninsula.\n\nIn response to this proposal, a meeting of our officer corps has been convened to deliberate on the path forward. The decision at hand is critical."
 VIE_PQC_Mil.4.d:0 "While we did have doubts, it seems that both the Republic of China and the forces on Phu Quoc are willing to fight on the correct side of history. Preparations are ongoing to move their base of operations to Saigon in preparation for operations almost immediately. With their assistance, our army will have the experience of some of the most skilled fighters of the Chinese Civil War! The Reds will soon be running back to the hills they came from!"
 VIE_PQC_Mil.5.d:0 "Despite our clear request, and the ongoing threat of the Northern Army, General Huang has rejected our request for integration. They seem to want to sit on the sidelines and watch history pass them by. Reports from the French also indicated significant military buildups and expansions by the Phu-dai's Army on the Island that we should watch for..."

 Etat_du_Vietnam.0.d:0 "Recently, Bao-Dai, the Chief of State of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam has arrived in Saigon in an effort to reunify Cochinchina and Annam under one government. For years, the Bao-Dai government of Vietnam faces many problems across the nation such as an incompetent colonial administration, religious paramilitary groups, bandits, and a nationwide Communist insurgency from North to South. Despite these problems, Bao-Dai managed to unify Cochinchina and Annam under his rule under the name of the State of Vietnam, or État du Viêt-Nam in French. Since Bao-Dai has unified these two regions under his control, he hopes to gain more autonomy from France by gaining control of the other Crown domains of Vietnam and destroying communism once and for all."

Most days, nothing happens, but the fear stays; I wake up and just want to be home. I saw the news that we have new allies 'integrated' into the army. They're not my allies; I watched as one of Leroy's 'UMDC Catholic militia' cut and hacked through random people whom we knew were innocent; that's not the cause I thought we were fighting for. Not to mention that with some of these French's new units, if you turn your back too long, they'll shoot you. We are fighting as best as we can, but this is different than fighting the Japanese. Our French advisors and veteran officers from past world wars don't have any experience fighting something like this. We can go through a village ten times and see nothing wrong, and then the next time, we get ambushed. I'm beginning to think that some of our units are passing on information. The Khinh-Quan units are fairweather friends, and I wouldn't be surprised if they swap sides any day now."
 VIE_MIL.100.d:0 "Today, the Vietnamese's Bo-Quoc-Phong ( National Ministry of Defense ) has announced the successful amalgamation of different armed groups within the country. The seemingly insurmountable task of subordinating so many different army groups and militias has been achieved with great success due to the skilful diplomacy of Chief of State Bao-Dai and his government ministers for the National's cause Observers have commented that the South Vietnamese are experimenting with different types of warfare, including creating Scouting Armored divisions and integrating forces specially trained for jungle warfare (Khinh-Quan). Somehow, Catholics, Buddhists, and remaining Religious Sects's Militaries have all been brought under one banner, united under the nationalist cause, and finally brothers in arms. With such impressive achievements being made in the country, it seems that the insurgency in the south is in its final days, and peace will soon be restored to that part of the world."
