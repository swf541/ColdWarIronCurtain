HUM_Building_up_a_Tourism_Industry:0 "Building up a Tourism Industry"
HUM_Building_up_a_Tourism_Industry_desc:0 "We are severely limited by regional space for traditional economic methods. As such, a key factor in our future economic strategy will be the lush beaches and beautiful oceans. Tourism is a golden goose that we can tap, which can begin with the basic expansion of local tourist industries."
HUM_Rebuild_the_Royal_Hotel:0 "Rebuild the Royal Hotel"
HUM_Rebuild_the_Royal_Hotel_desc:0 "The Royal hotel is one of the key institutions which bring us revenue. The money from the hotel is vital for our income streams, and provides an excellent base from which the rich and powerful can explore the archipelago of their own volition, with incredible luxury and even more incredible prices."
HUM_Widen_the_Southwark_Port:0 "Widen the Southwark Port"
HUM_Widen_the_Southwark_Port_desc:0 "As of the current moment, the arrival of cruise ships is a vital step in our aims for a tourist industry. The port right now is insufficient for our needs, both domestic and international, as such we will need to fund a widening of the key piers and construction of new boarding infrastructure."
HUM_Modernizing_southwark:0 "Modernising Southwark"
HUM_Modernizing_southwark_desc:0 "The crown jewel of our territories is Southwark, and Southwark is a mess of outdated infrastructure, poor housing arrangements, and an economy of entirely fisherman and shippers. Some funding towards proper road infrastructure, a governance structure suitable for an independant nation, and some rentable office spaces will begin turning Southwark into a proper capital"
HUM_Finding_an_Oil_Drilling_Partner:0 "Finding an Oil Drilling Partner"
HUM_Finding_an_Oil_Drilling_Partner_desc:0 "Oil drilling operations are challenging, especially when very few nations even regard us seriously. We'll need a partner to help raise the necessery capital to construct oil drilling platforms. Our ambassadors are ready to begin discussing concessions, but we need confirmation from the state on who to pursue a deal with."
HUM_Electrification_of_Southwark:0 "Electrification of Southwark"
HUM_Electrification_of_Southwark_desc:0 "A modern state needs modern infrastructure, and that infrastructure includes lighting, heating and the latest and greatest consumer goods. This will need an expansion of electricity transmission and transformer capacity, as well as acquiring some new generators."
HUM_Import_De-salination_Treatment_Machines:0 "Import Desalination Machinery"
HUM_Import_De-salination_Treatment_Machines_desc:0 "Water is a fundamentally important need for any state, and we aren't exactly flush with underground wells or freshwater lakes and rivers. That leaves us only one admittedly expensive option, which is to set up a desalination plant to convert saltwater into freshwater. Thankfully this does mean most of the population will have access to clean water, something most states can only dream of"
HUM_Invest_in_Salt-tolerant_Crops:0 "Invest in Salt-tolerant Crops"
HUM_Invest_in_Salt-tolerant_Crops_desc:0 "There aren't many farms in our state, quite obviously because most of the soil is non-arable, and doesn't have enough freshwater to sustain crops like cotton. We can put some investments into salt-tolerant crops like Barley and plantations for cash crops like Coconuts."
HUM_Rebuild_the_IJA_Shinnan-Shoto_base:0 "Rebuild Shinnan-Shoto Naval Base"
HUM_Rebuild_the_IJA_Shinnan-Shoto_base_desc:0 "During the second world war, the Japanese occupied these islands, and the Imperial Japanese Army set up several military bases. The largest, now a decrepit decaying mess is only some minor investments away from being reactivated as the headquarters of a proper defense force to deter aggression."
HUM_Smuggling_Pirate_Weapons:0 "Smuggling Pirate Weapons"
HUM_Smuggling_Pirate_Weapons_desc:0 "Piracy is a major source of stolen or acquired weapons worldwide. East and West, modern and ancient. We can't get weapons through manufacturing and buying them from major nations is expensive, leaving us the only option as acquiring weaponry on the black market. It will also be low-key compared to traditional licensing."
HUM_Resettle_the_Nagashima_Submarine_Base:0 "Resettle the Nagashima Submarine Base"
HUM_Resettle_the_Nagashima_Submarine_Base_desc:0 "The Nagashima Submarine base will serve as the ideal headquarters for our new navy, and it's slipways can be used for planned retrofits of small coastal patrol craft. Operating proper submarines is out of reach for now, but some cutters and patrol craft will instantly provide us the means to at least slow potential invaders and prevent raids from pirates"
HUM_Repair_Leftover_IJA_Patrol_Craft:0 "Repair Leftover IJA Patrol Craft"
HUM_Repair_Leftover_IJA_Patrol_Craft_desc:0 "The IJA operated quite a few small patrol gunboats for anti-raiding actions and as a form of coastal reconnaissance, some of which are still here, though admittedly they have seen better days. Our options are limited though, so repairing them will be our route to being able to secure our coastal waters. Sadly there are none of the IJAs midget submarines left to supplement them."
