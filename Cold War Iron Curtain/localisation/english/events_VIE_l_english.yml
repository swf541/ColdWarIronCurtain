French Union forces to regroup south of the line and Viet Minh north of the line. 4. Free movement of the population between the zone for 300 days. 5. Neither zone to join any alliances or seek military reinforcements for up to 300 days. 6. An establishment of the International Control Commission to monitor the ceasefire.
