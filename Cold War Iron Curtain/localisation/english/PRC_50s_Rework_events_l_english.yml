When the troops landing on the island lost their unified command and did not consolidate their beachhead positions, they still carried out operations in accordance with the established operational direction and penetrated deep into the enemy. By 4:30 on October 25, the Kuomintang launched a counterattack with the help of reinforcements and tanks. In the afternoon, our army suffered heavy casualties, and only the remaining troops joined up at Guning tou and repelled several counterattacks by the Kuomintang army.\nDue to the weather and strafing by the Kuomintang air Force, all our landing ships were destroyed. By the afternoon of October 27, our troops were found and surrounded by the Kuomintang near ShuangRushan Mountain, and our troops fought bloody battles until the afternoon of October 28, until the head of the 246th Regiment Sun Yuxiu was wounded and committed suicide, and the rest were captured."

Although Hu Feng has long been a leading figure in leftist literary theory, his ideas have been repeatedly criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong. The fundamental reason is that Hu Feng opposed the concept of \"art serving politics,\" which Mao Zedong proposed at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. Despite widespread criticism, Hu Feng persisted in deviating from the national literary line, adhering to his one-sided and abstract theory of subjective fighting spirit, supported by a small group of nearly one hundred people who maintained anti-Marxist literary creation.\n\nHu Feng's theory of subjective fighting spirit, although highly focused on subjectivity and authentic art, has diverged from our country's unique literary ideology.

In the meeting, he made the comment that \"the pace of agricultural co-operative development should not be too fast and the demand should not be too hasty\", which, in the eyes of the other comrades of the Central Committee, was clearly a right-leaning opportunistic mistake and a forgetfulness of the principles of the Party as a communist.

Mao Zedong proposed to \"double\" the number of co-operatives but Deng Zichu still insisted on the original plan of \"halving\" the number of co-operatives.

However, it is annoying that the quality of these supplies varies, and there is no lack of counterfeit and shoddy products among them. In order to earn high profits, the unscrupulous traders in charge of the frontline supplies went so far as to falsify canned food to supplement the nutrition of the soldiers, and cut corners on medicines and bandages to treat injuries and illnesses as well as warm clothing, which led to the untimely deaths of many volunteer soldiers due to malnutrition or infected diseases.

The conference proposed that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private ownership of the means of production, the main contradiction in the country is no longer the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but the contradiction between the people's demand for establishing an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country, and the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current situation where the economy and culture cannot meet the needs of the people.\nThis conference was held under the shadow of the collapse of the Gao Gang Group.

Taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion, the Indonesian ruling group initiated a large-scale anti-Chinese campaign, resulting in severe losses for the local Indonesian Chinese community. The Chinese government repeatedly urged Indonesia to stop its anti-Chinese activities, and the two countries signed a joint communiqué.

He pointed out that the tendency towards egalitarianism denied that there should be differences in the incomes of production teams and individuals, i.e., it denied the socialist principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work; and the tendency towards excessive centralization denied the system of ownership of the production teams, denied the due rights of the teams, and arbitrarily upwardly adjusted the property of the production teams to the commune. Both tendencies include the denial of the law of value and the idea of equal exchange, which is of course wrong."

Then under the chairmanship of Liu Shaoqi, Lin Biao and other members of the Politburo Standing Committee spoke one after another, accusing Peng of opposing Mao Zedong and claiming that Peng had usurped the Party's ideology. Under the leadership of the Standing Committee, many Central Committee members and alternate members of the Central Committee also came forward to criticize Peng Dehuai, accusing him and his supporters of being \"opportunists\" and \"collaborating with foreigners\" and \"forcing Chairman Mao to step down\".and \"forcing Chairman Mao to step down\". Chairman Mao then spoke at the Plenary, accusing Peng of \"bourgeois ideology\", thus bringing the \"criticism of Peng\" to a climax.
