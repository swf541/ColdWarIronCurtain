Now, as the People's Liberation Army advances victoriously towards the Greater Southwest, the failure of the Kuomintang reactionaries has become inevitable. Patriotic Yunnan generals Long Yun and Lu Han have crushed Chiang Kai-shek's plan to establish an anti-communist base in Yunnan.

But the Communists, with no experience of landing operations, were helpless against the Taiwanese fortress which Chiang Kai-shek had operated for so long. As a result, the Chinese Communists passed on to us a letter of request for help, in which they hoped that the Red Navy's Pacific Fleet would provide landing equipment and gun support to assist in the liberation of Taiwan and its neighbouring islands."

Now that we can finally free ourselves to deal with this matter, the Party and the State will enlist volunteers among all levels of Party members and cadres in Fujian and Fujianese fighters of the People's Liberation Army, armed with weapons, equipment and radios, to smuggle them across the Taiwan Strait with the help of intelligence officers who are travelling to Taiwan to support the already very weak Taiwanese Communist Party."

At 1:30 am, three PLA regiments boarded wooden boats and successfully landed on the beach.\nHowever, after the landing, the various units were disorganized and did not receive unified command. When the troops landing on the island lost their unified command and did not consolidate their beachhead positions, they still carried out operations in accordance with the established operational direction and penetrated deep into the enemy. By 4:30 on October 25, the Kuomintang launched a counterattack with the help of reinforcements and tanks. In the afternoon, our army suffered heavy casualties, and only the remaining troops joined up at Guning tou and repelled several counterattacks by the Kuomintang army.\nDue to the weather and strafing by the Kuomintang air Force, all our landing ships were destroyed. By the afternoon of October 27, our troops were found and surrounded by the Kuomintang near ShuangRushan Mountain, and our troops fought bloody battles until the afternoon of October 28, until the head of the 246th Regiment Sun Yuxiu was wounded and committed suicide, and the rest were captured."

In the meeting, he made the comment that "the pace of agricultural co-operative development should not be too fast and the demand should not be too hasty", which, in the eyes of the other comrades of the Central Committee, was clearly a right-leaning opportunistic mistake and a forgetfulness of the principles of the Party as a communist. Afterwards, Comrade Mao Zedong and other CPC patriarchs criticised Deng Zichu's erroneous opinions and right-leaning opportunism. Comrade MAO Zedong had met with Deng Zichu to discuss the number of co-operatives under agricultural co-operation. MAO Zedong proposed to "double" the number of co-operatives but Deng Zichu still insisted on the original plan of "halving" the number of co-operatives. After the fruitless discussion, Mao Zedong pointed out in his report on the Problem of Agricultural Co-operativisation that Deng Zichu "walked like a small-footed woman, committing the right-leaning error of solidification of the mind"."

However, it is annoying that the quality of these supplies varies, and there is no lack of counterfeit and shoddy products among them. In order to earn high profits, the unscrupulous traders in charge of the frontline supplies went so far as to falsify canned food to supplement the nutrition of the soldiers, and cut corners on medicines and bandages to treat injuries and illnesses as well as warm clothing, which led to the untimely deaths of many volunteer soldiers due to malnutrition or infected diseases. At the same time, the country has begun to organise the Three Anti-corruption Campaign, which has uncovered a large number of corrupt bureaucrats colluding with the capitalists, and perhaps we need to make some timely adjustments to the solidarity with the national bourgeoisie."

Subsequently, armed conflicts erupted between Tibetan and Yi ethnic groups, with these ethnic armed forces engaging in intense battles with the People's Liberation Army.

Subsequently, the Tibetan people rose up and took control of Lhasa. With authorization from the central government, the PLA launched the Battle of Lhasa, bombarding multiple Tibetan military positions before capturing Lhasa. The Kashag tore up the previous peace agreement and led the high-ranking lamas and officials to retreat from Lhasa, establishing a temporary government in the south to continue their resistance against the Liberation Army. After proclaiming Tibetan independence, the PLA launched a courageous attack, eliminating the Tibetan army and other insurgent forces, including the Chushi Gangdruk. The Kashag was disbanded, and a democratic reform plan for Tibet was announced. Although small guerrilla groups still roamed in the mountainous regions, the plot of the reactionary elements in the upper echelons of Tibet to divide China had essentially failed."
