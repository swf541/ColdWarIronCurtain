VIE_Form_3_Ministries_desc:0 "In order to keep growing, we must look to acquire funding from all possible sources. This could mean taking on loans from French banks in order to expand businesses and operate new sources of income for our country."

Well, they'll never play chess, but maybe that can help monitor the insurgency system. For a low price, we have been told that a computer system can use punch cards to monitor our success in pacification and track our logistics system. Even the Pentagon uses these computers; we don't want to fall behind. Vietnam will enter the cyber age!"

Commercial farming must be an important part of our slow march to economic prosperity, and the land in Saigon would be a key part of our commitment."
VIE_TongTruong_CongChanh_GiaoThong_desc:0 "Though the railways have been hit very hard, the roads fair little better. Many are still dirt roads, apart from the main highways. This requires an initiative on our part, to rebuild damaged sections of the road, and to pave parts of some roads that are used more than others."
VIE_Introduce_Dong_Currency_desc:0 "At last, we are ready to break from tradition and impose economic independence with the currency we will use. The Vietnamese Dong, the new banknote that will be in circulation, will be backed by strong banks and a strong commitment by the government."
VIE_SmallScale_Agri_Reforms_desc:0 "The way of life in the Central Highlands and for much of the country is the farming community. Improving their crop yields will also mean a steady hand, as pushing too hard too fast may destroy the farmers and their families, and we need to pursue growth with caution."

With so many military operations, they think their products could be of assistance. Looking at the current mess that is our Joint Staffs, they could be right. By established a head office, it will allow us to communicate and order from IBM quickly. Perhaps we might get a bulk discount?"
VIE_Further_Inveset_in_Saigon_desc:0 "Saigon is filthy and free. The pearl of our nation and the heart of its burgeoning industry, we have the means and the capital to invest in it. Our civilian industry must be bolstered, and our infrastructure must be improved in order to make the city in to a capital that could contend with any in the region."

With new investments and technological improvements, it can be another vital vein in the body of the industrial base."
VIE_Protect_French_Plantation_Owners_desc:0 "The French plantations of old, having long been stocked and worked by Vietnamese farmers, young children and old men, must now serve us. Though many wish to have the land split up for use by smaller farmers and more families, we must protect the holdings, for they are an important industrial supplier of food."
VIE_Electrify_Rural_Nam_Phan_desc:0 "The rural regions of Nam-phan have always been backwards and outdated for centuries and largely still are. Thus electrification would be the foundation for further Industrialization and investments in the Region."
VIE_Repair_SaigonMytho_Railway_desc:0 "The Saigon-Mytho Rail line is quickly becoming an important - and antiquated - way for industry to move the fruits of our labor. Our government has recognized that we should devote some capital to improving or expanding the rail lines to better serve us."
VIE_Export_Rubber_Natural_Resources_desc:0 "With our new capabilities, we can now increase rubber production and exportation, and our other resources have also caught up with other countries, meaning we can now afford to open up larger trade ports and trading laws."

VIE_Asian_Desk_desc:0 "We have an important role to play in Asian affairs. Although not the largest nation in Asia, we have a spirit and resolve that can easily sway the balance of a conflict. But we must pick carefully how we apply ourselves. We don't want to become overstretched in fixing the problems of all Asian countries."
VIE_Western_Desk_desc:0 "It's a sad reality that it is difficult to operate in this world without the backing of the West. Although the age of imperialism is supposedly dying, it seems that it is not dying but simply morphing into something new. We need to prep our diplomats so that they can get the Western powers on our side. With their support, we will have their industrial might and diplomatic sway behind our nation, and we will be able to expand our influence worldwide."
VIE_Demand_Japanese_Deport_CuongDe_desc:0 "It is disturbing enough to know of the efforts of Cuong-De to undermine our government, but it is insulting to know that the Japanese government refused to repudiate his attempts. Utilizing political pressure, we must demand that he be deported back to Vietnam, to answer for himself."
VIE_Negotiate_Brevet_Lines_desc:0 "The Brevet Lines, the nautical borders that separate Nationalist Chinese and Vietnamese claims, have been a point of contention. The Kuomintang has made moves to suggest that they believe they are the rightful owners of Vietnamese islands in the South. This requires us to negotiate with the Cambodians to clarify the border situation."
VIE_Demand_PhuQuoc_Ownership_desc:0 "The Nationalist Chinese have gone too far, first in posturing that the island of Phu-Quoc is theirs, and now we have seen armed military personnel moving in positions on and nearby the islands. This is far too much for our government to stand by and accept. We must make strong statements to dispel the illusions that the Kuomintang suffer from."
VIE_PhuQuoc_Launch_Invasion_desc:0 "The time for politics is past. The Kuomintang have ignored all warnings. Our military is prepared to launch a full invasion of the island to take back what is ours. We will not be denied the property we own."
VIE_Focus_on_Other_Matters_desc:0 "Military action against KMT incursions in the Phu Quoc region is not the major concern, other matters must take more of our time and effort. We will concern ourselves with the border question when we come to it."
VIE_Regarding_French_Drawn_Borders_desc:0 "In our continuing border disputes with the Nationalist Chinese, we will have to rely and possibly rework the classical borders written by our original colonial overlords. While fair and solid for a long time, now we must rework them and ensure that these pitiful squabbles end."
VIE_Accept_DeFacto_TranNinh_desc:0 "In an effort to bring peace, we have elected to agree to the borders that the French have drawn up. While we do not feel it punishes the KMT for their efforts against us on our borders, those borders, properly enforced, will work."
VIE_Claim_TranNinh_desc:0 "With the question of our borders up in the air, we must take the opportunity to claim the region of Tran Ninh, full of villagers and people who identify as Vietnamese, and are more closely connected to us than the Laotians."
VIE_Pau_Treaty_desc:0 "Our diplomats with the French have committed to finding a breakthrough in negotiating our financial independence, and we have found that our French counterparts are sympathetic to the cause. We will work to ensure that Vietnamese financial freedom is in our hands above all else."
VIE_Sign_Autonomous_Forex_Agreement_desc:0 "With our agreement with the French, we have on our plate the ability to sign an agreement that will allow us to open the trading and exchanging of currency.

VIE_Accept_Foreign_Affairs_Administrative_Duties_desc:0 "We have prepared ourselves well for the prospect of managing our own affairs and the affairs of state elsewhere in the world, and it is time for us to step into the shoes of foreign and internal policymaking. Ensuring our resources and political bounds permit us to do so, we shall begin to carve our own path."
VIE_Matignon_Treaty_desc:0 "The French have decided to wash their hands completely of Vietnam, and are ready and willing to sign a treaty announcing their total withdrawal from the region. At last, our independence is being assured by the government, and a conference in Matignon will formalize Vietnam's total independence. Freedom has been achieved!"
VIE_Beg_Crown_Domain_French_Renouncement_desc:0 "Our French allies have inadvertently caused a political headache for us by not outright denouncing or renouncing the hold the crown has on the people up to this point. While France does not see the harm in this, they are in fact creating resistance to our government in areas where royalist beliefs are strong."
VIE_Korean_War_desc:0 "Korea is embroiled in a conflict similar to our own; a power vacuum has been created, and the evil forces of communism are seeking to sink their teeth into the newly established nation. We must do something to prevent this, but how much can we really spare in our intervention? If we allow South Korea to fall, a domino effect might occur across Asia and new republics like our own might be snuffed out by the menace of Marxism."
VIE_Korean_Intervention_desc:0 "Our efforts to supply the Korean soldiers in their effort against the communists are not enough. Our national defense administration has committed themselves to preparing an expeditionary force to help solidify the defense of liberty against the Chinese and their North Korean puppets."
VIE_Accept_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. It is a proposal we cannot turn away from, our goals are aligned and our duty to the world is on full display."
VIE_Ignore_Rhee_Proposal_desc:0 "Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, two of the largest movers and shakers in the region, have let our people know that they are prepared to offer us a hand in a movement to unite many of the countries of Asia under a unified banner of political cooperation in the face of communism. Though interesting, it is not within the goals of our nation to cooperate currently with foreign bodies. Indeed, their interference would only damage our ability to run the war as we see fit."
VIE_Attract_US_Support_desc:0 "In our effort against our enemies, our greatest ally is the American government. Steadfast maintenance of our government must now involve full cooperation, and the great resources of the United States will give us the edge we need."
VIE_Greenlight_American_Intervention_desc:0 "America has voiced its willingness to enter the conflict on our side, not content to simply help. With their military might and economic power, we will surely vanquish our enemies in the North and end this bitter conflict."
VIE_A_Change_in_Course_desc:0 "In order to improve inwards, we must look outwards to our close Asian brothers and see how they have managed their affairs. We must move on from the influences of French affairs in our decisions, and chart our own path."
VIE_Look_up_to_Japan_desc:0 "The affairs of the Japanese in developing a stable post-war government and their way of government have influenced our way of thinking. It is time for us to consider following their lead more closely, in order to ensure continued success."

VIE_Accept_Geneva_Treaty_desc:0 "Our dastardly cruel enemies to the North have fought us to a bitter standstill, and our political allies have us in a corner, saying that we should accept the terms being presented in Geneva that would split our country in two. While we hate this idea with our fullest minds, we cannot deny the war has progressed in a way we cannot guarantee our success. We must bite the bullet and accept the terms."

VIE_Recommision_WW_Native_Veterns_desc:0 "Our combat effectiveness only goes as far as our general staff. In order to win the war, we will have to enlist the help of veteran leaders who have fought in the greatest wars of our generation. Their services will ensure our victory in any struggle."

VIE_Incorporate_Religious_Sects_BinhXuyen_Forces_desc:0 "In order to gain legitimacy in the South, we most cooperate with entities not totally sympathetic to our cause. The religious sects in the Mekong Delta and the Binh-Xuyen crime syndicate have been a thorn in our side for years, but if we can “convince” them to work with us, we will have gained a powerful ally."

VIE_Rescue_PhatDiem_Catholic_Militias_desc:0 "The Catholic Militias in and around the city of Saigon have run into trouble dealing with forces in the area.

It is our utmost concern to quickly seize their assets and bases for our national protection effort."
VIE_Organize_Recon_Armored_Battalions_desc:0 "Investing in better and deadlier armaments is paramount in this struggle. We must find a way to bring in heavier equipment ot arm our recon units."
VIE_Section_Marine_desc:0 "With its long coastline and numerous maritime trade routes, our young nation is in dire need of a dedicated navy to protect its territorial waters and vital sea lanes. This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea.

VIE_CD_Incorporate_Religious_Sects_BinhXuyen_Forces_desc:0 "In order to gain legitimacy in the South, we most cooperate with entities not totally sympathetic to our cause. The religious sects in the Mekong Delta and the Binh-Xuyen crime syndicate have been a thorn in our side for years, but if we can “convince” them to work with us, we will have gained a powerful ally."
VIE_CD_Deal_Leroys_Ambitions_desc:0 "It is time to survey the options. The situation with Leroy has reached an impasse, and we may not get another chance to make a decision on what to do."
VIE_CD_Rescue_PhatDiem_Catholic_Militias_desc:0 "The Catholic Militias in and around the city of Saigon have run into trouble dealing with forces in the area.

This development was a natural response to the growing importance of maritime security in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and countering emerging regional threats.\n\nThe formation of the National Army's Section Marine shall mark a crucial milestone in our military history, ensuring that Vietnam possesses a formidable presence not only on land but also at sea.

VIE_Tighten_Noose_On_Western_Journalism_desc:0 "The pen is mightier than the sword, and so we need to regulate it just like any other weapon. We can't have \"journalists\" wielding and invent dangerous fictions against our government. From today, the government will take a guiding hand in ensuring that the news is more \"factual\". Most importantly, we will ensure that corrupted journalists who are being paid to undermine government work do not get the front page or any page for any matters at all!"
VIE_Legalize_Casinos_Prostitutions_desc:0 "Our country's culture is relatively conservative, so opening casinos and allowing prostitution might seem like a bad idea… but it also sounds like a fun one. With these new industries, we will open a valuable new income stream for the government. We know that many of these things happen. Whether it is illegal or not, we might as well profit from it. This way, we can build our own gambling industry in Saigon with blackjack and hookers. "
VIE_Erase_Sex_Scandels_PayOff_Debts_desc:0 "It's not easy being a leader; every day, there is pressure to make the right decision, and everybody lets you know when you make a mistake. So it's no wonder that we like to gamble a bit and enjoy the company of beautiful companions. Unfortunately, the public doesn't understand the stress of power, and if word got out about our \"excesses\" then we could have a serious crisis. We can use our power to lean on any investigative journalists delving into the president's personal life; the only stories about the leader will be him helping old ladies cross the street, not using prostitutes. We can also tap the wealthy beneficiaries of our economic policies for \"donations\" to help pay off our mounting debts. Our virtuous image must be preserved!"
VIE_Expand_Grande_Monde_Casino_desc:0 "People love to gamble; not only our people but visitors from abroad are arriving to lose their hard-earned money in our casinos. The Grande-Monde casino is not only making record profits, but it is also is the largest currently in Southeast Asia; the time has come to expand the main hall of the casino.
