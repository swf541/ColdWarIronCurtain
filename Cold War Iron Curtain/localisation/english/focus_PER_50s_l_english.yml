 iran_oil.1.d:0 "The election of Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran marked tensions with the United Kingdom and United States as he long spoke of nationalizing the liquid gold once the opportunity was granted. After pushing the Majlis toward agreement, the once radical idea seemed far more likely than not. Finally, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was nationalized pushing out Anglo influence over the vast resources of Iran. The United Kingdom has already shown open resentment, threatening Iran if the decision is not reversed. Regardless of Britain's stance, Iran stands firm in face of this crisis."
 iran_assasinations.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Assassination of General Haj Ali Razmara"
 iran_assasinations.2.d:0 "Iranian Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara has reportedly been assassinated by a radical Islamist in Tehran. Serving as prime minister since 1950, Razmara consistently advocated for decentralization and a more favorable arrangement with the British government. Razmara had initially been backed by the British foreign office and alienated many powerful moderate landowners - as well as the National Front - whilst failing to gain the support of the more radical parties. According to eyewitness accounts, Razmara was attending a memorial service at the Shah Mosque when a member of the crowd fired 3 shots. The assassination was carried out by the radical Islamist group Fadayan-e Islam, most likely because of Razmara's opposition to the nationalization of Iran's oil supply. This assassination coincides with the concept of Iranian nationalization seeing a rapid growth of popularity in recent years. Being the latest tragedy in a string of Iranian minister assassinations."

 iran_political.10.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Mossadegh's Resignation Gambit"
 iran_political.10.d:0 "Earlier this month Prime Minister Mossadegh requested from the Shah that the ability to name the Minister of War and Chief of Staff be given to him which was refused. Therefore, Mossadegh announced his resignation and appealed directly to the people. While Ahmad Qavam was appointed as a replacement, radical groups organized nationwide protests and strikes in favor of Mossadegh. All over the country, strikes and demonstrations have broken out. Over the course of the last five days, protesters clashed with troops as the country came to a complete standstill. With the loyalty of the soldiers in doubt, military commanders ordered all troops to return to their barracks, and Tehran was completely in the hands of the protesters. Today, the frightened Shah dismissed Qavam and Mosaddegh was re-appointed, along with all the military powers he had previously demanded. Mossadegh is now more popular than ever and in a position to further expand his position in government"
 iran_political.10.o:0 "Mossadegh's ploy has paid off."
 
 AJAX.12.d:0 "Iranian General Fazlollah Zahedi was a devout loyalist to the Shah and had been accused of being a traitor by Mossadegh prior to the failed coup. He was named as the new Prime Minister in the Shah's imperial decree and after the failure of the coup quickly disappeared from public view. Although Mossadegh has ordered security forces to round up plotters, Zahedi has so far remained out of their scope and on the run. He declared himself the rightful Prime Minister of Iran and called for the people of Iran to rise up against Mossadegh, with very limited effect. However, with Mossadegh's supporters returning to their homes, pro-Shah plotters are now in a considerably stronger position. More recently, rumors claim that Zahedi has attended a secret meeting of supporters of the Shah, and should they be able to gather popular support, Mossadegh's position would be in considerable danger. Whatever the case, Zahedi's presence in Iran constitutes a major thorn in the side of Mossadegh's rule."
 AJAX.11.d:0 "Following the failed Royalist coup, there was much speculation about the whereabouts of Reza Shah. However, it now appears that the Shah fled the country immediately following the coup attempt and arrived in Baghdad with his second wife. After his request for temporary asylum was granted, he spent time at the Iraqi government's guest house before being flown to Italy, where he remains. With the departure of the Shah, Mossadegh rules the country virtually unopposed. However, he has ordered all his supporters back to their homes and without them his government appears almost vulnerable - and the firmly pro-Shah General Zahedi is still on the run."
 AJAX.10.d:0 "After his successful resignation gambit, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh continued to consolidate his power, while the Shah grew increasingly concerned with his growing influence. Recently, Mossadegh's efforts have culminated in him issuing an order officially abolishing parliament, effectively giving him and his cabinet absolute power and stripping the Shah of any real authority. Scared of Mossadegh's absolute power, a royal decree was drawn up by Royalist plotters and signed by the Shah dismissing Mossadegh from his role and appointing loyalist General Zahedi in his place. The commander of the Imperial Guard delivered the decree to Mossadegh, however he had been warned of the plot, presumably by the communist Tudeh Party, and had the commander arrested, arguing that the Shah no longer had power to issue decrees. Both Zahedi and the Shah's whereabouts are unknown and many suspect Western involvement in the attempted coup. While the situation continues to deteriorate, it appears that Mossadegh has, at least for the time being, maintained his authority in Iran."
