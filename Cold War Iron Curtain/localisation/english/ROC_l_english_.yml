Chen was promised the position of Hunan governor by Chiang Kai-shek in Post-War China, should he not defect to the Communist Party.§!"
 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_NORMAL_DESC:0 "§gLiu Wenhuis relationship with Chiang Kai-shek has been as unstable as the provinces he has been governing for the past 20 years. Liu has joined the Kuomintang in 1926 and commanded the 24th army of the NRA in Sichuan. He was eventually driven back to Xikang Province by his nephew, General Liu Xiang, where he continued to sabotage the central government by allowing communist troops to walk through Xikang undisturbed. Chiang however did not have the political ressources to take measurements against Liu. During the War of Resistance, Liu made sure that his forces saw as little action as possible, often ignoring orders from Nanjing. Liu remains untrustworthy in the eyes of Chiang but his local autonomy and influence make it difficult to replace his administration.§!"
 
 
 POLITICS_YU_HUNG_CHUN_DESC:0 "§gYu Hongjun, also known as O. K. Yui, has been serving in the KMT his entire political life. The Nationalist government appointed him mayor of Shanghai in the year of 1937, a position that he utilized to negotiate peace between Chinese and Japanese forces right before the Battle of Shanghai, which ultimately went unsuccessful. After the Chinese Civil War and the Great Retreat of the Kuomintang government to Taiwan, he served as the 4th Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial government of the Republic of China until his recent promotion to Premier of the Republic under the Presidency of Chiang Kai-shek.§!"
 POLITICS_WU_GUOZHEN_DESC:0 "§gWu Guozhen began his political career at Princeton University, where he earned a doctoral degree in political science in 1926. Upon his return to China the same year, he climbed up the career ladder in Hunan under the reign of local warlord Hsia Tou-yin. After the Japanese occupied Hunan in 1939, Wu joined Chiang Kai-sheks government in Chungking and held various important political roles until the Great Retreat including mayorship of Chungking, Shanghai and the position as vice-minister of Foreign Affairs. In the aftermath of the retreat to Taiwan, Wu served as Governor of Taiwan, attempting to bring greater self-governance and less police brutality to the Taiwanese people. Wu was opposed by the conservative members of the Kuomintang, which eventually lead to his dismissal from the government and the Kuomintang. Now, with the old government suspended, Wu once again does see the chance for Taiwan to take a liberal, peaceful and moderate anti-communist path.§!"
 POLITICS_KUO_LIANG_DESC:0 "§gKuo Ting-liang is one of the few generals to be educated at the Virginia Military Institute, where he eventually met his future subordinate Sun Li-jen. Together they both fought against the Japanese army in the Burma campaigns and pushed for American-styled reforms in the Republic following the loss of the Chinese mainland. Despite his opposition to Chiang Kai-shek, Kuo is still an anti-communist at heart but is willing to listen to the advice and orders given by the United States of America. It is safe to assume that under his vice-presidency he will spend countless efforts to improve and maintain relations with Washington and reconsider the reclaimation of the Chinese mainland by military force.§!"
 POLITICS_XISHAN_JUNTA_DESC:0 "§gFollowing the turmoil of the Great Retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan, Yan Xishan was eventually relieved of his duties as Premier by Chiang Kai-shek after Li Zongrens political downfall. Yan expected to spend the rest of his life outside of politics, being seperated from his beloved home Shanxi for the unforseen future. However, when General Sun Li-jen marched into the Presidential Palace in Taipei and deposed Chiang Kai-sheks government, everything changed yet again for Yan. The provisional government has decided to appoint him as temporary Premier of the Republic until the end of Military rule, reasoning that his mediation skills between Li Zongren and Chiang Kai-shek during the civil war could prove effective for the integration of the old government of Chiang Kai-shek. Maybe this will be the opportunity for Yan to start a political development that could eventually lead to his return to Shanxi, whether that'd be through diplomacy or war.§!"
 POLITICS_WANG_YUN_WU_DESC:0 "§gConsidered by various Chinese and foreign circles as one of Chinas greatest modern scholars, Mr. Wang has been serving key roles in political and educational institutions, including the Chinese National Institute of Woosung, various newspaper and press agencies, the ministry of education and finance as well as the Executive Yuan. Wang, believing in Chinese tradition, culture and confucianism, was opposed to the communists during the Chinese revolution, decided to re-enter politics and has worked his way up into the newly elected conservative government of the Republic of China.§!"
 POLITICS_ZHU_JIAHUA_DESC:0 "§gKnown and respected by many party members as the the man responsible for the relocation of the Academia Sinica, Zhu Jiahua is an influential politican within Kuomintang, serving as President of the Academia Sinica since 1940 and has founded various projects for Chinese students to study abroad in the United States of America, seeing the American educational and academic landscape as a necessary step towards an efficent education for future politicians and scholars. His projects were originally disapproved by Chiang Kai-shek but now with him gone from power, Zhu returned to the political sphere and is now serving as the Prime Minister of the Republic of China as part of the Conservative government, aiming to continue his former policies at the Academia Sinica.§!"
 POLITICS_CHANG_LI_SHENG_DESC:0 "§gChang spent his young life as part of the Chinese work-study program in France, where he later enrolled in the University of Paris and majored in political science. During that time he met the young Zhou Enlai, trying to convince Chang to join the Communist Party which Chang eventually declined. After his return to China, he joined the Kuomintang in 1924 and alligned himself with General Chen Cheng during World War Two, launching campaigns against the CCP. During the last years of Chiang Kai-sheks reign, he assisted Chen Cheng's land and economic reform programs and after the deposition of Chiang, he has began studying possible implementation programs for cultural autonomy of the native Taiwanese population and constitutional governance, which he is hoping to implement and reinforce during his term.§!" 
 POLITICS_ZHANG_JUNMAI_DESC:0 "§gZhang Junmai rose to prominence during the 1930s as the co-founder and leader of the Third Force Party in the Republic as an alternative to the paternalistic Kuomintang and the totalitarian Communist Party. Zhang advocated for the implementation of a social democratic political structure in China after the social democratic model of the German SPD with strong commitments to human rights, seperation of powers, nationalisation of major industries such as railroads and mines. Displeased with the unconstitutional reign of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, he left the country for the United States but returned after the Anti-Chiang coup and has joined the social liberal circle around Sun Fo, becoming a close associate of him which eventually lead up to him being appointed the Premier of the Republic.§!"
 POLITICS_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "§gSun Fo, also known by some as Zhesheng, has to be one of the most prominent and most symbolic members of the Kuomintang. Being the son of Sun Yat-sen, the father of the revolution of 1911, the father and first president of the Republic and founder of the Kuomintang, Sun Fo has quite an impressive parental background to look at. Having served in the Nationalist government under his father but also Chiang Kai-shek in various ministries and other positions, he became one of the most high-ranking officials in the Kuomintang. However due to his liberal and nationalist believes, inspired by his father, he had multiple arguments and fallouts with former chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarding the question of constitutional government and negotiations with the Communist Party in the face of Japanese Aggression. After the departure of the Nationalist government to Taiwan, he left the country in 1952 but like many other liberal-minded scholars he returned after the deposition of Chiang and immediately became the top candidate of the social liberal camp in the Kuomintang.§!"
 POLITICS_LEI_CHEN_DESC:0 "§gBefore moving to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government, Lei Chen played an important role in the reorganisation of the China Youth Party and the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party during the 1946 National Assembly Session and the first Legislative Yuan Elections of 1947. Already before his departure to Taiwan, he as well as Hu Shi, Wang Shiije and Hang Liwu prepared to publish the newspaper "Free China", which was however delayed due to the Communist crossing of the Yangtze River. While maintaining good relations with Chiang Kai-shek at first and supporting his political plans, Lei criticized the authoritarian measures of the government. He was dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek from his position of Political Advisor to the President and was facing expulsion from the Kuomintang. With the Generalissimo being ousted from power and civilian governance returning, Lei Chen has won the recent election as the head of his newly founded China Democratic Party. Although his party does not hold the absolute majority, it is expected that Lei's presidency will see fundamental changes in governmental strucutre of the Republic of China.§!"

 ##Parties and Ideologies##
 
 Three_principles_of_people:0 "Tridemism"
 Three_principles_of_people_desc:0 "Tridemism follows the philosophy of Sun Yat-sen which is known as the San-Min Doctrine. Those 3 principles are often translated into nationalism (Minzu), democracy (Minquan) and welfare (Minsheng). In order to achieve those principles, the country needs to go through the three phases of the revolution starting with military rule which focuses on erasing corruption and opponents of the revolution, followed by the second phase which is a transitional period, during which a provisional constitution will be promulgated. Its object is to build a local selfgovernment system for the development of democracy. The third stage, which marks the completion of national reconstruction, will usher in constitutional government. During this period the self-governing bodies in the various districts should exercise the direct political powers of the people."
 
 Three_principles_of_people_conservative:0 "Kuomintang (Minzu-Orthodox Wing)"
 Three_principles_of_people_conservative_desc:0 "In contrast to the other factions of the reformed Kuomintang, the conservative circle is advocating for preserving Chinese heritage and roots as a major priority of the state domestically. Economically, it supports a mixed economy that usually involves Central Planning from the Government itself alongside partial privitization of some industries, allowing the co-existence of Nationalization and Privitization. Diplomatically, the right-wing members hope for the eradication of Communism as the main Foreign Policy of the Republic, alongside increasing China's self-reliance and preventing any American attempts of subjugating China into its sphere of influence."
 
 Three_principles_of_people_progessive:0 "Kuomintang (Social Liberal Wing)"
 Three_principles_of_people_progessive_desc:0 "The Progessive wing of the Kuomintang consists of more liberal minded members who seek to distance themselves from the military wing and advocate for more reforms towards market liberalism and welfare for the common people, based on non-radical reforms. They also seek to limit corruption within the government and advocate for Free Trade with the West."
 
 Three_principles_of_people_socdem:0 "Kuomintang (Minsheng faction)"
 Three_principles_of_people_socdem_desc:0 "The left wing of the Kuomintang consists of members advocating for the Minsheng principle, which traces back to Sun Yat-sens philosophy during the Tongmenghui. The concept can be understood as social welfare and thus focuses on improving the life of the common people. The Inspiration of this principle was influenced by American thinker Henry George and his theory of Georgism. The area of said livelihood is divided into 4 areas (food, clothing, housing and transportation) and the reforms and policies of the Left Kuomintang are centered around those areas, while they also advocate for Chinese Nationalism and Anti-Imperalism."
 
 Three_principles_of_people_nationalist:0 "Kuomintang (Minzu faction)"
 Three_principles_of_people_nationalist_desc:0 "The right wing of the Kuomintang consists of members advocating for the Minzu principle, which traces back to Sun Yat-sens philosophy during the Tongmenghui. The concept can be understood as Civic Nationalism and thus focuses on uniting the different Chinese ethnic groups in the face of imperialist aggression. While opposed to social and constitutional reforms, the right wing is advocating for financial reforms to strengthen the industrial capacities of the country."

That is why our glorious leader Chiang Kai-shek has seen their true intentions during his time in Moscow and decided to preemptively strike against the CCP in 1927.

Following Generalissimo Chiangs resignation in the face of various communist victories on the mainland, he and his supporters have now had enough of Li Zongrens ambitions and policies.

They serve as the guideline for improving China during the republican era and can briefly be summarized as 'Democracy, Nationalism and Welfare'.\n\nMinzu, the first principle, advocates for developing national identity rather than an ethnical identity and calls for the Independence of the whole Chinese people from external imperialist threats and internal minority rule.\n\nMinquan, often translated as Democracy, supports the right of the Chinese people to express political opinions and to control administrative positions, which is being represented by the National Assembly. Such rights include the right to vote, recall, initiative rights and the right to hold referendum. The political system is to be divided into five seperate branches instead of just three. The state is divided into a Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuan, combining the Montesquieuan thought with Chinese tradition.\n\nMinsheng, often translated as the People's Welfare, focusing on four areas: Clothing, food, housing and mobility. This principle is also heavily influenced by the thoughts of Henry George, calling for taxation of land as "the only means of supporting the government via an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system."\n\nIn the last decades since the death of Dr. Sun, the Kuomintang has failed to implement those principles and has shown little to no believe in this philosophy anymore. But from this day on, we will put all of our resources and efforts into the completion of the national revolution under the Three Principles of the People.

By establishing new policies, emphazising on compromise, you will eventually satisfy the majority of people to a certain point where they will accept your reign and recognise some sort of legitimacy. It is all about finding the perfect balance of concessions and restrictions.'\n\nOf course this can't be the solution forever, he added. Times are changing and so do people.

After what happened at Xi'an, Chiang arrested Zhang shortly afterwards placing him under house arrest for treason against the Kuomintang, stopping him from managing to defect to the Communists.

Specifically, several articles have criticized the Kuomintang for not following constitutional procedures, especially in terms of term limits and the government felt Lei Chen was behind these criticisms.

It also instigated a harsh campaign of repression against the Taiwanese people who were forbidden from discussing or remembering the events. This all increased tensions between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. Many Taiwanese have not forgotten and continue to see the events as a clear example of the corruption and brutality of the mainland Chinese Kuomintang. They also see it as proof as to why Taiwan must be free and independent to control its own destiny."
 
 Formosa.11.d:0 "In a stunning development in the Republic of China, the ruling government has collapsed to an uprising led by Taiwanese resentful at the domination and control of their island following the arrival of the Kuomintang from mainland China after their defeat during the Chinese Civil War. In previous days, across the island, especially in the capital Taipei, thousands took to the street. The government deployed police and military with orders to end the protests through violence but this only caused more people to join the protests. When the government ordered troops to use live weapons, this saw many troops refuse and join the uprising. Without the support of the military, the government surrendered with many fleeing to friendly diplomatic missions or the airport in order to seek protection or flee. Newspapers in the country have announced the success of the Formosan Revolution."

The successful revolutionaries recently announced the establishment of a new Provisional Government of Formosa to transition the island to a new era of inclusive and just governance. In the upheaval, some former government officials and supporters managed to flee but a large number remains on the island, especially refugees who fled mainland China and the communists there. For now, the new government has stated these people will be watched closely, those who committed crimes will be dealt with and once the government establishes itself it will decide what to do with the refugees. The statement was not seen as reassuring by the refugees and many Kuomintang supporters are also concerned about the sacred mission of liberating the mainland."
 
 Formosa.100.d:0 "The new state of Formosa recently announced in a national broadcast that it has rescinded all claims to mainland China. It stated the nation would no longer be devoting its efforts and sacrificing its resources for a cause that held little importance beyond the refugees and Kuomintang loyalists. Formosa is only concerned about the welfare, safety, and development of its own people. They added their hope that by washing its hand of these land claims it hopes to establish friendly, neighborly ties with the communist Chinese regime but it remains committed to defending its borders from aggression. A formal response from Beijing has not come but many analysts believe the Formosa announcement will likely not change the stance of the mainland Chinese government that the island is a province of China and should be returned to the country."

The two countries are expected to discuss expanding defense cooperation, trade, and the regional security environment. President [USA.GetLeader] is will meet leading government officials and is expected to visit cultural sites across the country. The communist Chinese government released its own statement condemning the United States for interfering with the internal affairs of China and reiterated that it would soon bring the rebellious island back.

 CHI_KMT.1.d:0 "The KMT stands at a crossroads. In recent years it survived a war with Japan and a massive communist resurgence that nearly overthrew the regime. Many in the party are now saying the moment is right to initiate reforms and change the course of the party. They blame martial law, centralization, and authoritarian tactics as the reason why Japan and the communists were able to thrive. More democratization and liberties will strengthen the state and ensure any hostile ideology or force is unable to thrive in the republic. However, there are headliners in the party who disagree and argue it was only through centralization and martial law that the republic was strong enough to defeat the threats. They argue China must continue on this path in order to complete its independence and unification. President [CHI.GetLeader] must decide on reform or staying the path."

The Chinese government hopes nuclear energy could play a major role in meeting future energy demands as all of China advances. However, the institute will also consider the private development of nuclear weapons. The question will be whether China seeks to develop such weapons on its own or by asking the Americans for help. If developed on our own, we would be in complete control of such weapons but it may take a long time. Bringing the Americans would accelerate the development but limit our independence and ability to gear the program to our situation. We must decide which route to take as the communists are no doubt developing their own bomb."
 
 CHI_INDO.0.d:0 "During the last war the Japanese seized Indochina from the French and established a brutal regime. However, the Vietnamese resistance tenaciously fought first the French and then the Japanese, often using China as their main base. At the end of the war, China occupied northern Vietnam until the French returned. France now seeks to reestablish its prewar colonial but are now facing an uprising by the Viet Quoc. We have strong ties with Vietnam and many of its factions use our land as bases or supply hubs. We must decide to either back the French, to ensure no communist Vietnamese faction becomes dominant, or support the anti-French Vietnamese nationalists and push for the non-communists to triumph."
 
 CHI_BANDIT.0.d:0 "The chaos of war and civil war has left the countryside and isolated towns the victims of bandits. Many are military units which disserted or armed militias ravaging the countryside. These bandits commit unspeakable crimes on travelers and raid goods moving along the roads. The KMT government will have to address this crisis in order to restart internal trade and better unify the country. For many peasants, it is the local warlords they look to for protection from the bandits, not the government. If the bandit problem is not addressed, popular support and the economy will rapidly erode."
 
 CHI_VIN.0.d:0 "As part of our policy of backing the anti-colonial Viet Quoc, our intelligence agents have begun quietly assassinating Viet Minh officiers. The communist Viet Minh are another major anti-colonial Vietnamese party and they compete with the Viet Quoc for legitimacy and recruitment. Removing their officiers will hinder their ability to recruit more fighters or establish organized bands of fighters. The Viet Quoc should be able to better recruit and present themselves as a true party for the independence of Vietnam. The Viet Minh do not appear to be aware of our involvement in the killings."
 
 CHI_VIN.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, a number of our officiers have been assassinated, mostly in our bases along the Chinese border. Investigations are ongoing but the likely culprits appear to be either the French, the Chinese, or the Viet Quoc. The French view us as the primary threat but are not as established in the region. The Chinese are virulently anti-communist but are supporting the anti-colonial cause. The Viet Quoc claim to be our comrades and wish to fight together against the French but seem incapable of such sophisticated operations. Regardless, removing our officiers weakens our recruitment and combat effectiveness. We will have to monitor the situation closely."

 KMT_LAND_REFORM.0.d:0 "One of the biggest issues facing the Republic of China, since its earliest days, has been the issue of land reform. The perceived failure to break the power of landowners and provide opportunities for peasants has long been blamed on peasant unrest and communist popularity. The failure to institute a sweeping land reform is also blamed for lackluster economic development as China continues to not reach its true agricultural capacity. However, landlords offer political and financial support for the government and breaking their power may risk empowering those groups who often oppose the KMT. The government must decide to either initiate a full-scale land reform to rectify the problem, or offer a more modest reform plan in order to provide peasant relief while also not alienating the powerful landlord classes."
 

 
 TIBET_KMT.100.d:0 "The Republic of China recognizes the Panchen Lama, seen as spiritually second only to the Dalai Lama, is increasingly seeking a more prominent political role. The Panchen Lama is said to command his own loyal military forces and is looking for outside help. The Chinese government is willing to offer his forces arms, training, and funds on the condition that in the event the Dalai Lama refuses to accept Chinese sovereignty, he will act. This puts the Dalai Lama in a difficult position as it is now clear that he risks a potential uprising or coup if he does not follow the dictates of China."
 
 TIBET_KMT.4.d:0 "The Republic of China has requested we accept their sovereignty over our lands. The Chinese promise they would respect our current government and administration but wish to oversee our foreign policy and defense. If we do not accept this demand, we risk some overt or covert attempt to change our mind. But we would have a chance to maintain our independence. If we do accept, we will maintain a degree of autonomy and freedom of action, however, overtime, the Chinese may seek to directly occupy Tibet."
 
 TIBET_KMT.20.d:0 "The Dalai Lama received reports that major roads and strategic crossings are being blocked by armed men. It appears the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama himself in terms of spiritual importance, is orchestrating a coup. This is a direct reaction to our decision not to accept Chinese sovereignty and we suspect the Chinese are urging the Panchen Lama to act. For the Panchen Lama, he has expressed a desire for greater political authority, and it appears that is what the Chinese are promising him. He has also been organizing his own fighters and is no doubt using them in this coup attempt. Our own loyalists in Lhasa are organizing to respond, but it is unclear if we will stop the coup."
 
 KMT_MIL.2.d:0 "The Justice Investigation Bureau is the premier intelligence agency for the republic. It is directly under the executive committee but the recent war with Japan and the communists exposed its weaknesses. The organization at times appears prone to corruption and bribery. On the ground intelligence was also weak as the organization struggled to gather information of communist infiltration and movements. A new reform plan is being implemented to upgrade training, improve the organization, and increasing pay to raise morale. More importantly, the influence of military officiers will be limited to improve the ability of the JIB to investigate military matters."
 
 KMT_MIL.3.d:0 "The reforms and investigations of the Republic of China military reveals a number of high-ranking officiers are ideologically compromised or prone to corruption. The executive leadership must decide how to proceed. Some advocate a great purge be conducted to remove these negligent officers from important positions. Such drastic action may alienate the military and impact morale for the short-term, but have long-term benefits. The other possible solution would be to send these officers to difficult or isolated posts, especially in the frontier. These officiers would no longer be in a position to negatively affect the defense and be kept from achieving higher ranks. Going this route would lessen the impact on the military institutionally, but the positive impacts would not be as much as with a mass purge."
 
 KMT_MIL.4.d:0 "The executive leadership decided to deploy those officiers identified as being ideologically compromised, corrupt, or militarily inept to the frontier. This will keep these officiers from important leadership positions and often isolated from forming military cliques. These frontier positions lack many of the comforts or glory found in other postings. These officiers will now find their routes to promotion blocked and many are expected to eventually retire. Removing these officiers to the frontier will help us curb corruption and inefficiency, opening the way for more competent and patriotic officiers to take over."
 
 KMT_MIL.5.d:0 "President [CHI.GetLeader] directed military, police, and intelligence authorities to begin the mass arrest of officiers identified as being ideologically compromised, politically corrupt, or criminally incompetent for their position. This mass arrest of military officiers opens many vacancies and will cause unease within the military. However, the path for younger, patriotic, and competent officiers to take higher positions is now open. This period of arrests and purges will no doubt cause panic and organizational challenges in the military, but once it ends, the defense of the Republic of China will be far stronger."
 
 KMT_MIL.6.d:0 "The purges of military officiers by the Republic of China government appears to be ending. The last group of officiers were recently detained, tried, and sentenced. Many analysts believe it will take time for the Chinese military to re-establish morale and stability within its ranks. However, the government is confident once the newly promoted officiers gain confidence and experience, the military capabilities of the republic will be much stronger than before. There is also confidence that the purges will indicate to younger officiers and those joining the military academies that they must be professional and devoted to the nation."

 FRA_KMT.2.d:0 "The French government indicated they will aid us in our efforts to develop our nuclear program. This will be a major boon for our efforts to acquire a nuclear deterrence. More importantly, we will not be beholden to the United States and the relationship with France will be far more cooperative. We can offer France access to nuclear materials for their own programs. Our top nuclear officials plan on visiting Paris to visit their counterparts in the coming days."
 
 FRA_KMT.3.d:0 "The French government rejected our proposal for nuclear cooperation. They apparently do not see the benefits of a joint venture and alignment of interests between our states. We are not aware if the French decision is due to fears of foreign repercussions or direct threats from other powers. Regardless, it is their loss and the people of China will continue its path to nuclear deterrence. The government will redouble its efforts to support the scientists and facilities dedicated to advancing Chinese nuclear technology."
 
 KMT_Sinification.0.d:0 "The Republic of China launched an intensification of its Sinification Campaign. The government has long sought to forge national unity by spreading Chinese culture and language across all communities. Privately, one official said that all people must become Chinese or leave the country and that the day of the barbarian was over. The campaign is facing resistance, especially in the frontier provinces of China who are often not ethnically Chinese or follow their own cultural or religious traditions. The government does not appear to be overly concerned of non-Chinese backlash."
 
 KMT_VICTORY_TERROR.0.d:0 "The Republic of China government recently launched a campaign to stamp out dissent and threats to the state. The police and other state agencies have already opened investigations of politicians, writers, activists, and intellectuals accused of either sympathizing with or openly supporting enemies of the state. In particular, the focus appears to be on communist sympathizers and criminal elements. Many human rights activists are  expressing concern that this new crackdown on dissent marks a "White Terror" and will be used to crush any threat to the ruling party at the expense of individual or political rights."
 
 KMT_CULTS.0.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to legitimize the secret cults that flourish across rural China. These quasi-religious and cultural movements have existed for centuries. Many of the most powerful uprisings in Chinese history have occurred because of these cults. In recent decades, local self-defense forces have formed from these groups in the era of warlords and civil war. The Chinese government believes that by legitimizing these groups, it will bring these self-defense forces and stability provided by these groups in support of the state. However, there are fears that such groups may use this legitimization to expand their influence with the protection of the state."
 
 KMT_CULTS.1.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to crackdown and dismantle the secret cults and societies that flourish across rural China. While these groups have existed for centuries, in recent decades they began forming local self-defense forces amidst the general lawlessness from the era of warlords and civil war. By targeting these groups, the Chinese government will risk a law and order crisis until it can establish a presence in these areas. Others worry these cults may even turn into brigands and further erode law and order. Regardless, the move indicates a strong commitment by the Chinese state to assert its control over the country."
 
 KMT_SHOW_TRIALS.1.d:0 "A series of mass public trials are occurring across the Republic of China. Japanese Collaborationists from the Second Sino-Japanese War and communist activists accused of crimes during the civil war are being put in open court. The government is publicizing these trials across the country and early indications indicate the courts will convict all those charged. The government is eager to demonstrate the strength of the Republic of China and provide the Chinese people justice. Opponents to the government and international observers condemn the trials as purely for show and political theatre."
 
 KMT_LAND_REFORM.1.d:0 "In a surprise decision, the Republic of China passed a new, comprehensive Land Reform Law, meant to reducing the overwhelming power of landlords and provide opportunities to peasants. For decades, the ruling KMT established strong ties with rural landlords and for years its failure to support land reform proved advantageous to the communists. The government hopes its commitment to land reform will endear peasants to the state and cut the communists from a fertile pool of recruits for their insurgency operations."
 
 KMT_LAND_REFORM.2.d:0 "The Republic of China passed a new Land Reform Law, which the government claims mark a dramatic victory for the peasants of China. However, despite their claims of achieving a major reform, many local and international observers claim the reforms are minimal. Landlords retain many loopholes and peasants will not find dramatic changes to their situation. It appears the government is not willing to lose its traditional support from the landlords who provide economic and political support to the state."
 
 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.0.d:0 "The Republic of China announced it would lift Martial Law from the country. This is part of a major reform effort within the ruling KMT party. The reformers strongly believe the restoration of constitutional and democratic rights will weaken dissent and popular support to regional leaders or communist infiltrators. Similar reforms are likely to continue, despite criticism from some of the old guard in the party that such reforms and democratization could lead to a loss of control and dissent. The decision to lift Martial Law is being largely lauded across the country."
 
 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.1.d:0 "The Republic of China passed legislation making the current Martial Law in the country permanent. This is a major victory for the KMT old guard which long argued against reformers advocating a restoration rights or democratic practices. They argue such reforms would make China weak and vulnerable to the threat of regional warlords and communist influence. The Chinese government believes continued Martial Law will keep the state strong, stop internal dissent, and help curb the influence of hostile ideologies or nations."
 
 TIBET_KMT.3.d:0 "The Republic of China strongly condemned the Dalai Lama for his naked usurpation of sovereignty from China. The Chinese government claims the Dalai Lama has illegally ceded territory and conducting foreign affairs without permission from China, who is the sovereign. The Chinese call on the Dalai Lama to cease his provocations and affirm his loyalty to China, noting that he should appreciate how much autonomy and respect he receives from the republic."
 
 TIBET_KMT.10.d:0 "In a surprise to many observers, the Republic of China signed an agreement with Tibet that recognizes its independence. The Chinese government stated its belief that the territory had been conquered by an oppressive Qing Empire and the new, democratic Chinese state could not hold on to a territory seized for the vanity of an emperor. The Tibetan government, led by the Dalai Lama, praised President [CHI.GetLeader] for his able leadership and promised a new era of peace between the two states. Many observers believe China is seeking to establish friendly ties with Tibet and keep it as a buffer state with South Asia."
 
 TIBET_KMT.5.d:0 "The leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, refused an ultimatum from the Republic of China to recognize the Chinese government as the sovereign of the country. The Chinese accuse the Dalai Lama of ceding territories and conducting affairs as a head of state and not as a subordinate to the Republic of China. The Chinese argue they are willing to give the Dalai Lama and Tibet wide autonomy, but in exchange, the Dalai Lama must stop conducting himself as an independent head of state. The Tibetan government refusal is a clear indication that the Dalai Lama is claiming complete independence from China."
 
 TIBET_KMT.6.d:0 "The Dalai Lama announced that Tibet is a sovereign part of the Republic of China and he is not a head of state. This marks an acceptance by the Dalai Lama of Chinese demands that he accept the sovereignty of the republic and halt any efforts to negotiate treaties or cede territories on his own authority. The Dalai Lama likely agreed after receiving assurances that the Chinese would provide Tibet immense autonomy and keep the current government to administer the territory for China. Some observers believe fears of a military intervention or Chinese-sponsored uprising were also factors pushing Tibet to accept the Chinese demands."
 
 TIBET_KMT.21.d:0 "The Dali Lama was overthrown in a recent coup organized by the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama, the spiritual number two of the Dalai Lama has for years harbored a desire for increased political influence. It appears armed troops loyal to him were able to secure key passes and towns, including the entrances to Lhasa. With the only recourse being a civil war, the Dalai Lama decided to instead order his loyalists to stand down. The new Tibetan government announced it will accept Chinese sovereignty on the condition Tibet retains its autonomy. Many international observers believe the Panchen Lama enjoyed the backing and even the arms of the Republic of China."
 
 TIBET_KMT.22.d:0 "An attempted coup to remove the Dali Lama in Tibet ended in failure. Fighters loyal to the Panchen Lama, spiritually second to the Dalai Lama, sought to seize control of strategic towns, passes, and entrances to Lhasa in order to force the rapid capitulation of the Dalai Lama. However, loyalists to the Dalai Lama thwarted the effort to capture areas around Lhasa and the Panchen Lama soon found his loyalists melt away once groups of pro-Dalai Lama fighters came to challenge them. In a statement the Dalai Lama claimed to have stopped a pro-Chinese attempt to seize power and pledged he would not compromise on the independence of his country. The Republic of China denied any involvement, although some photographs emerged showing the Panchen Lama fighters with Chinese rifles."
 
 TIBET_KMT.11.d:0 "A new agreement was reached between the Republic of China and India. Many of the previous disputes were removed following the Republic of China recognizing the independence of Tibet. Previously, China claimed sovereignty over Tibet and viewed itself as the sovereign to decide the border between India and Tibet. With Tibet recognized as independent, the Chinese border with India is much smaller and less in dispute. After brief negotiations the two sides were able to sign an agreement to formally settle their border. Both the Chinese and Indian government expressed hope that the new settlement will hopefully spur a renewed friendship between the largest democracies in Asia."
 
 CHI_SEATO.1.d:0 "The Republic of China agreed to join the Southeast Treaty Organization (SEATO) in order to expand its cooperation between member states and combat communist influence in the region. For the Chinese government, joining the group will expand its regional role and allow it access to local allies as it seeks to coordinate anti-communist activities in Asia. The Chinese government expressed its excitement at participating in the next SEATO Summit. The United States is especially happy for China to join as it gives the organization greater legitimacy. The Soviet Union and regional communist parties are condemning the action and accuse SEATO of being an imperialist front. Opposition members have privately told the media their concerns that SEATO may offer little material benefits and make China a larger target for international communism."
 
 TIBET_KMT.15.d:0 "The Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibet, called on the international community to defend the country following reports that the Republic of China launched an invasion. Chinese troops are reportedly streaming into Tibet with the objective of establishing Chinese control. The Chinese government claims it is not launching an invasion but is instead doing a local action to restore control over a province. The Chinese argue the Dalai Lama is an autonomous administrator, but his recent claims to being independent and efforts to negotiate territory are clear violations and he must be brought to task. The Chinese insist all efforts at a peaceful resolution were rejected by the Dalai Lama and it hopes to swiftly restore law and order for the people of Taiwan."
 
 TIBET_KMT.16.d:0 "Following the recent invasion of Tibet by the Republic of China, the traditional Tibetan aristocracy finds itself facing arrest or charges. This aristocracy has long been a major source of legitimacy, membership, and power for the Dalai Lama and his government. The Chinese decision to target this group and weaken them economically and militarily is to break the base of support for the old government. If the Dalai Lama and his allies lose bases of local support, this will strengthen efforts by the Chinese government to establish a more compliant Tibetan state. More importantly, Chinese officials brought to Tibet will also be protected from local competition. A number of Tibetan aristocrats are said to be fleeing in the direction of Nepal, India, and Burma."
 
 TIBET_KMT.105.d:0 "Following the successful coup by the Panchen Lama against the Dalai Lama, Tibet signed an agreement with the Republic of China. Tibet will be a part of China and be known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Chinese government promised to provide support for the Panchen Lama, including giving him extensive political power, in exchange for his government submitting to Chinese sovereignty. The Tibetan and Chinese government insist that the administration and governance of Tibet will remain largely the same, however, Tibet will no longer be able to conduct foreign policy or have complete control of its military forces."
 
 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.0.d:0 "As part of the recent political reforms and democratization in the Republic of China, President [CHI.GetLeader] signed a new law relinquishing a number of powers back to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan, once a rubber stamp for the ruling KMT has begun holding much more debates and passing laws without direction from the executive council. Observers believe the new reforms are turning the Legislative Yuan into a more potent political institution and check to executive power in the Republic of China."
 
 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.1.d:0 "The CC Clique faction within the KMT has seen a major drop in its influence and power within the Republic of China. Many of its prominent leaders are facing corruption charges or being removed from key posts. Media reports highlight some of the military and political failures of CC Clique leaders over the last few decades. The CC Clique represents the rightwing of the KMT and established a reputation for being virulently anti-communist, anti-Japanese. However, the new democratization reforms have opened positions to other groups and many reformers view the CC Clique as the old guard that must be replaced if China is to prosper. Reformers hope the weakening of the CC Clique will enable a smooth transition to democracy. CC Clique leaders warn rapid reforms will lead to instability and misgovernance."
 
 KMT_Atoms.1.d:0 "The Republic of China announced its full acceptance and support for the Atoms for Peace program initiated by the United States. Atoms for Peace is a program that encourages nations to learn about the risks and benefits of nuclear technology. The program provides support on education and technical assistance in developing nuclear reactors. The Chinese government believes the program will help it train nuclear scientists and develop its own nuclear technology to better reach its energy needs as it looks to a brighter future. Regional communist parties are criticizing the program as a covert means for China to acquire the means to produce nuclear weapons and accuse the United States of supporting the nuclearization of East Asia."
 
 KMT_Atoms.2.d:0 "Under a project started by the Republic of China which has been kept secret from the public for years now, was officially made public when the first Chinese Nuclear Test was a success under the codename of "Project Blue Sky White Sun". The Chinese population both living in China and living overseas have encouraged the Chinese Republic's acquirement of Nuclear Weapons, proud that their country could be seen as equal to the Western Powers and that the days of the Centuries of Humiliation are over for good. At the same time it has been condemned by many Western News Reporters who stated that the American Government who worked with the Republic of China in acquiring Nuclear Weapons, has only fed the Chinese lust for challenging the current World Order led by the United States and the Soviet Union, potentially forming their own World Order to challenge the Americans and Soviets. Nevertheless, Chinese Nationalism is at its peak everywhere, with the Chinese population celebrating their nation's marvelous achievement."

 CHI_INDO.10.d:0 "The Republic of China clearly showed its pro-French position in regard to Indochina by launching a series of military operations against Viet Minh positions along the Chinese border with Vietnam. The Chinese had stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in the region during the second World War and have extensive knowledge of Vietnamese nationalist positions. The Chinese government claims its forces are targeting the communist Viet Minh and its operations are meant to prevent the expansion of communism in the region. In response to criticism that it is supporting imperialism, the Chinese noted that not targeting the Viet Minh would only ensure the Vietnamese people replace the oppression of colonialism with the slavery of communism. The Viet Minh are said to be reeling from these strikes."
 
 ROC_VICTORY.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union and its ally Mongolia recently intervened in the Chinese Civil War to prevent the total collapse of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) as it struggled to hold back the Armed Forces of the Republic of China. After intense fighting, a ceasefire emerged, with Inner Mongolia re-establishing another Republic and the PRC setting up their government in the Beijing, its surrounding areas, and Manchuria. In the west, Sinkiang has joined East Turkestan. The rest of China, including most of its industrial base and ethnic Han population, is under the control of the Republic of China. The uneasy ceasefire is currently holding, but both sides are expected to rebuild their arsenals and plan for a future resolution of the conflict in their favor."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.15.d:0 "Efforts of restoring internal stability and harmony in the Republic of China appear to be failing as several military cliques have risen up against the government. These military cliques are reminiscent to what was seen during the Warlord Period where military leaders formed loyal forces led by officiers who shared similar professional, cultural, or territorial backgrounds. Many in China claim a Second Warlord Period has begun and there are worries of potential civil war, political instability, or a breakdown in law and order. The Chinese government claims the situation will be handled swiftly and China would not be the victims of any warlords."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.16.d:0 "Jiao Yulu, a former communist, has returned to his roots as a cult leader by proclaiming himself the heir to the Ming Empire. His claim is being backed by the popular Red Spear Society and other cults dedicated to the restoration of the Ming dynasty. The return of warlordism and rise in public distrust has seen a surge of popularity to such groups which organize local self-defense forces to combat warlords, bandits, and those deemed as corrupt government officials. The Ming pretender wants to overthrow the Republic of China to restore imperial rule, claiming the republic lacks the mandate of heaven and China needs a new dynasty. The Chinese government will have to restore public trust and respond swiftly before this monarchist movement becomes too powerful."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.1.d:0 "Recent news suggest that the Hunan Clique has risen up against the Republic of China. These military officiers, citing oppressive government actions and interventions in local affairs, want greater autonomy and a reduction of centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Hunan to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Hunan officiers are known to have established ties with the communists during the 1920s and 1930s. There are fears from the Chinese government that the Hunan Clique may use those contacts and invite the communists for military help but end up handing the region over to the enemy."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.2.d:0 "The Ningxia Ma Clique has risen against the republic. These military officiers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Ningxia to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.3.d:0 "The New Guangxi Clique has risen against the republic. One of the most powerful cliques during the 1920s and 1930s, its uprising is being viewed with great concern by the Chinese government. The Clique is rising up due to centralizing efforts and reforms targeting the cliques and old guard of the republic. The Chinese government accuses the rebelling officiers of acting out of self-interest and call on all loyal officiers to stay loyal to the republic. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Guangxi is a major population and economic base for China."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.4.d:0 "The Qinghai Ma Clique of western China has risen up against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and the oppression of cultural rights along with autonomy as the primary cause of their unrest. The Chinese government called on all officers to remain loyal and condemned the clique for seeking to stop the development of China. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Qinghai is close to disputed borders and there are already concerns the rebel officers may seek to ally with either a foreign or domestic enemy of the republic."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.5.d:0 "The Shanxi Clique has risen against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at breaking the current military organization as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal to the state. The Chinese government will seek to act fast in order to quell other uprisings and to bring order to Shanxi quickly. Shanxi sits close to the communists and there are fears local and foreign communist agitators may seek to use this conflict to expand their influence."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.6.d:0 "The Xinjiang Clique has risen against the republic. These military officers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Xinjiang to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China. The clique is noted to have had close ties with the Soviets in the past."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.7.d:0 "The Yunnan Clique has risen against the Republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at changing the current military structure of the country as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal. The Chinese government will seek to ask fast as Yunnan is strategically a vital province and has access to several foreign states who may seek to use the uprising to their advantage."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.100.d:0 "The self-proclaimed Ming emperor of China, Jiao Yulu and his coalition of militias and cultists has brought the Second Warlord Period to an end. The charismatic former communist was able to tap into the anger and frustration of rural Chinese peasants who have grown fed up with the constant fighting between the Kuomintang, communists, and warlords. The return of the warlords was the last straw for many who feared their arrival would lead to more hardship and banditry. With Jiao Yulu victorious, the Republic of China appears on the verge of either joining forces and restoring the Ming dynasty or being destroyed."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.101.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. Internationally, there are increasing calls and pressure for the government to initiate new policies to prevent such a situation from emerging again."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.102.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) announced its forces had ended the Second Warlord Period. The PRC stated the corrupt and incompetent republic had led China to the point of disintegration and ruin. It then praised the peasants and people for rising up with the Peoples Liberation Army to sweep aside the corrupt warlords and incompetent republican provincial and national officials. The PRC concluded by announcing a program to provide development, prosperity, and modernization to the peasants who have been neglected and exploited for decades."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.103.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Republic of China managed to reunify the country despite the threat of militias, warlords, communists, and cults. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. President [CHI.GetLeader] promised to build a strong republic and lead China to its great destiny."

Being favored by the Americans, many claim that the coup was backed by the CIA and by the U.S. President, but these claims have not had any, hitherto, any backing whatsoever; it seems it will be a rumor among a plethora of rumors in the deposition of Chiang."

Following the recent months there have been multiple political changes within the Kuomintang. Certain party officials have disappeared, and new young promising talents are being trained in new party cadre schools, according to US-Observers in China. In a speech to his followers and critics, Chiang has promised to continue his approach of reforming the party and state, to combat corruption and suppressing communist remnants in Free China. Foreign scholars predict that Martial Law will be continued for the time being and hopes of Chinese Constitutionalism will be crushed for the following years or decades."

 KMT_mainlandburma.1.d:0 "Under the orders of Nanjing, thousands of troops crossed the sino-burmese border and established military bases within the region of Northern Kachin, encroaching on the region mainly to enforce its control over the territorial disputed area. Although Rangoon has acknowledged the presence of Chinese troops in Kachin and has ordered troops to resist their presence, burmese troops were utterly crushed upon launching a series of failed counterattacks. Nanjing has so far pressured Rangoon into not appealing to the UN regarding the issue, while threatening them with funding rebel groups in Burma who wish to collapse the authority of Rangoon should they attempt to appeal to the UN."

The colony itself marks the days and memories of the Centuries of Humiliation, the only way China can recover from such humiliation is to retake what was stolen by the Yangrens (Westerners) and to assert our strength, forcing them to acknowledge that their days of dominating China and Asia are over."

China has stated that Hong Kong belongs to them, using the former US President Roosevelt's promise to China regarding Hong Kong's return after World War 2 as the justification. Although the Chinese have wrongfully invaded the colony, they have so far yet to expel the local British Businessesmen and instead allowed them to remain in Hong Kong."

The Generalissimo has sent his son back to the city of Shanghai to be in-charge of forcing Shanghainese to rectify their nuisance behavior and be held accountable for it. Corrupt Businessmen, Secret Societies and even Gang members have decided to return to the city after the Civil War was won by us, showing that the task to tame the city won't be any easier than before.

Shanghai Youth Service Corps and Bandit-Suppression National Reconstruction Corps began massed arrests following the capture of many of their members, most of which were either involved in managing the Shanghai black market smuggling activities or were robbing people on the streets through violent means.

These actions would force many of these infamous Businessmen to be locked behind bars and some to have their heads cut off as part of Ching-kuo's plan to 'set an example for other Businessmen'."

Though allowing Capitalism but not Capitalist Corruption, Chiang Ching-kuo has publicly stated that 'those middle class Businessmen who have not found themselves within any places they shouldn't be should not worry about the raids'. Minor punishments were in-place for them however, as Ching-kuo did not wish to antagonize the middle class who would soon be the backbone of Shanghai after the reforms had concluded."

He had written down to his father about his previous grievances in 1948 after the failure to enact the reforms in Shanghai, and how he had tried various methods to pursue differently from before. As he was prepared to leave the office, he saw a report that he forgot to open.

This was met with joy by Chiang, who immediately saw the potential to turn the city into an internationally recognised rich metropolis. The city had recovered from the previous conflicts, with business back to usual for many of them.

He had also made the mistake of mobilizing the Shanghai Youth Service Corps, many of which began taking being ruthless and abusive with their strength, which caused a number of cases of innocent people being targeted by them.

The Communist Party of China has labelled these as 'fake western media claims' and that these landlords and businessmen are going through a period of rehabiliation.

After Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself Emperor of China, a national crisis erupted and numerous provinces declared their Independence from Beijing, beginning the era of Warlordism in China. The Kuomintang found itself in Guangdong from where it began to plan an expedition to unite the country. Sun-Yat-sen, the founder of the Party, died in 1925 and after a power struggle between Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-Shek, Chiang emerged triumphant and launched the Northern Expedition to unite the country under the KMT Banner. The following ten years went down in history as the Nanjing Decade, with the Kuomintang slowly trying to establish its rule over the country. Those years eventually came to an end, following the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident of 1937, escalating into a full blown war between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. After over eight years of tough resistance, the Republic emerged victorious and regained its former provinces of Manchuria and Taiwan from the Japanese.

The KMT follows the Three Principles of the People, which include Welfare, Democracy and Nationalism. After the rise of Yuan Shikai following the great revolution, the Kuomintang was banned but reorganised itself in Liangguang after the country split into various warlord regions. In order to unite the country, the KMT and the relatively small Communist Party of China formed the First United Front and defeated the Beiyang Cliques in the north, officially uniting China under the KMT Banner. However, various warlords were bribed and recruited by the KMT to maintain regional stability. Shortly after Dr. Suns death in 1925 and Chiang Kai-sheks consolidation of power, the CCP was purged from the KMT in 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Throughout the next decade until today, the KMT has been a shadow of its former self. Corruption, opportunism, factionalism and lack of popular support have brought the KMT into a terrible state.

However, when Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and the Wang Jingwei faction of the Kuomintang was defeated by the Chiang Kai-shek faction, the United Front broke apart and the Communist members were purged during the Shanghai massacre 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Following the next ten years, the Kuomintang tried everything to eradicate the remaining Communist bandits who escaped to Shaanxi but following the Mukden Incident of 1931 and the Shanghai Incident of 1932, anti-Japanese sentiments within the KMT have drastically increased which lead to the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek by General Zhang Xueliang in 1936, who forced the Generalissimo to join yet another united Front with the CCP against Japanese Imperialism. With the war against Japan coming to an end in 1945, it did not take long for the conflict between KMT and CCP to re-ignite.

The move shocked many western countries and made them realize that the weak China, which had only run away from it, had begun to stand up to it.\n\nNot only did it shape the Anti-Concessionist Movement in the country but it also re-ignited Chinese Nationalism and as of now we do again stand against the Imperalist in the West who are still trying to exploit our country for their own benefits.

It allowed a small handful of upper citizens to rule over the majority of the population. Also known as the Gentry, it was an elite class in the Chinese Society which held important positions in the bureaucracy and the military and was responsible for the collection taxes and the administration of local armed forces in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1911 this concept kept living on on a more intense level during the Warlord area which saw various generals and military governors declaring their independence from the Central Government in Beijing, with their base of support being the local armed forces. The old principle of despotic hierarchy lived on and even kept itself alive during the years from 1927-1952 within the Kuomintang. Exploitation, bureaucratic capitalism, opportunism, money laundring, opium smuggle, it all contributed to the downfall of China in the modern age.\n\nLeaving 1000 year old values behind is not easy, but it is a necessary step to lead the country into the modern age.

Various establishments of it will be installed throughout the country. The Union is not to be confused with the totalitarian "Labour Unions" of the despotic marxist countries in Europe and East-Asia which are being used to reeducate and brainwash the common people according to the governments policies. We aim to establish a union for the common man, who can finally raise his voice in his work environment and shall not be brutally exploited by his higher ups.

The position is relatively weak compared to the Presidential and Premier position but could still promise us some democratic legitimacy.\n\nFirst choice is the current Examination Yuan President and son of Dr.Sun, Sun Fo. He is also known for having an "iron neck" - meaning an outspoken liberal stance against Chiang Kai-sheks authoritarian measures. As a supporter of Constitutionalism and Chinese Nationalism, Sun Fo is advocating for reforms favouring constitutional institutions and the peaceful unification with the Communist Party. While this is totally unacceptable for our policies we can't purge him due to his status as son of the father of the Republic, which also gives him great popularity among the people.\n\nFavoured by Chiang Kai-shek and his allies, Chen Cheng is the other top choice. Chen was serving as a main commander in the NRA during the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Communist campaigns, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War against the CCP. In the late phase of the civil war he was appointed Governor of Taiwan Province where he declared Martial law in order to establish a strong Nationalist stronghold on the island in case of a defeat of the Nationalist Army on the mainland. While being a staunch anti-communist and supporter of Chiang Kai-sheks policies, he is advocating for economic liberalisation and landreform in order to calm tensions between the peasants and the government, but also seeking for close cooperation with the United States as a bulwark against Socialism."

But this visit is different, as Zhesheng is now standing here as the Vice President of the Republic of China, a unified China on paper but the goals of the Chinese Revoultion had still not been achieved to this day. In front of the marble sarcophagus he quietly starts to talk to his father promising him that he will do everything in his might to fulfill the dreams and ambitions of the Chinese Revoultion.

Nanjing proposes the establishment of a central council in Nanjing, with the reasoning being that such an institution will allow for greater cooperation between the member states in certain policy fields and will also reinforce peace in the region.

With tensions calming down between Nanjing and Moscow, the Chinese government approached us and asked for potential compensation for the victims and the families of those deportations. While refusing would greatly damage Sino-Soviet relations, we might need to consider refusing it due to our economic stagnation and arms race with the United States of America."
