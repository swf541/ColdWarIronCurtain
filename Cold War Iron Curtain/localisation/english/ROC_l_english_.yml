From 1930 to 1936, the Clique organized the reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a "model" province with a progressive administration.

However there are still obstacles on his journey to strengthen the Kuomintangs rule over all of China. Warlords and various other political cliques rule over major parts of China which could pose a serious threat to the National Leadership in Nanjing. Chiang has expressed his desire to reform the Kuomintang various times throughout the years, and with peace and civil order slowly returning to China he might be able to achieve his goals.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the defeat of the Beiyang Cliques in Zhili and Nanjing, the Kuomintang relocated its headquarters to Nanjing, declaring it the new capital of the Republic. Over time the Kuomintang secured their authority in the provinces of Central China. The government in Nanjing is the dominant political institution in those provinces and has effectively sidelined any other political rivials, whether they are former local warlords or opposed political cliques. Centralisation has lead to less corruption and more efficient governance in those regions and are considered the "core territory" of the Kuomintang regime, with the KMT seeking to expand their influence in the other regions of China as well.§!"

Yan, alongside various other young promising talents, was sent to study in Tokyo where he was fascinated by the Japanese westernisation efforts, believing that China needs to take similar steps to not fall behind on the international stage. After the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China and joined the fight against the Qing and eventually consolidated his power as Governor of Shanxi following the death of Yuan Shikai. Under his rule, Shanxi saw incredible progress in agriculture, healthcare and education as well as Yans own kind of Ideology called "Yan Xishan Thought", combining new elements of Neo-Confucianism such as self-criticism and self-cultivation.

Those 3 principles are often translated into nationalism (Minzu), democracy (Minquan) and welfare (Minsheng). In order to achieve those principles, the country needs to go through the three phases of the revolution starting with military rule which focuses on erasing corruption and opponents of the revolution, followed by the second phase which is a transitional period, during which a provisional constitution will be promulgated. Its object is to build a local selfgovernment system for the development of democracy. The third stage, which marks the completion of national reconstruction, will usher in constitutional government. During this period the self-governing bodies in the various districts should exercise the direct political powers of the people."

The Inspiration of this principle was influenced by American thinker Henry George and his theory of Georgism. The area of said livelihood is divided into 4 areas (food, clothing, housing and transportation) and the reforms and policies of the Left Kuomintang are centered around those areas, while they also advocate for Chinese Nationalism and Anti-Imperalism."

But following the defeat of the Beiyang clique, the party only focused on maintaining and expanding its power, eventually losing the support of the common people. Unefficient bureaucrats, corruption, factionalism and opportunism contributed to the decline of the Kuomintang.

 KMT_70s_Call_New_Legislative_Elections_desc:0 "While we held a handful of sham elections in the last decades, we now face the problem that our close associates in the Legislative Yuan who are loyal to Chiang and his government are slowly dying away as most of them are veterans and members who joined the party during the Nanjing decade. We need to reshuffle the institution but it is to be expected that not all new mandates will share the same hardline authoritarian views."

 KMT_70s_Appoint_Chiang_Ching_Kuo_PM_desc:0 "Chiang Kai-sheks advancing age is making the process of ruling over China more and more difficult.

 KMT_70s_Mandarin_Learning_Efforts_desc:0 "In order to maintain our grip on society we need to put more efforts into Mandarin Learning campaigns starting in school and going all the way to universities.

 KMT_70s_Appoint_Hsieh_Tung-min_Governor_Taiwan_desc:0 "In an effort to appease local minorities and communities we should appoint native KMT-alligned locals to crucial government position towards these regions such as governors and garrison officiers. We will start by appointing Hsieh Tung-min to governor of Taiwan who was born on Taiwan during the Japanese reign but decided to leave the Island in the 1920 to join the Kuomintang on the mainland. While we needed hardline anti-communists in key positions during the consolidation area following the years after the end of the civil war we should now encourage less radical and locally known people to replace them. Hsieh Tung-mins promotion will serve as an example of this."

 KMT_70s_Promote_moderate_patriotism_desc:0 "While Nationalism is an integral part of Dr. Sun Yat-sens three principles it can become a dangerous element if it becomes to radical. Instead of creating the missbelieve that the Chinese people are superior to the rest of the world we should emphasize the thought of patriotism, meaning that you can be proud of your country while not expressing any superior thoughts and the desire to go to war for your nation. Nationalist tendencies will only create the image of a hostile society and will greatly harm our relations with the West." 
 
 KMT_70s_Maintain_US_relations:0 "Maintain Relations with the US"
 KMT_70s_Maintain_US_relations_desc:0 "While Chiang Kai-shek had some heated arguments with the Americans during and after World War II it is clear that the United States have been our closest ally who provided us with capital, political philosophy and militarily support. It is a necessity to keep good relations with Washington for our nation, especially if you have their biggest rival, the USSR, at your own doorstep."

 KMT_70s_Open_the_nanjing_memorial_museum_desc:0 "Even after decades the War of Resistance had such a remakable influence on China that it will most likely still be an emotional factor for the forseen future. In order to never forget what happened on the battlefields and the occupied areas we should build a museum that will not only remind us of the brave resistance the Chinese showed in the face of foreign Imperialism but also how cruel human beings can be to each other so we humans will never let this happen again."

 KMT_70s_Modernise_Education_Institutions_desc:0 "The rise of Computers can be monitored in various armies all around the world, including the armed forces of the Republic.

 KMT_70s_spread_anti_ussr_propaganda_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has served as the root of all evil, the evil that is Communism. While Dr. Sun and even Chiang Ching-kuo saw certain effective aspects such as the organisation of the armed forces or the way of carrying out an anti-imperialist revolution it was clear that the CPSU was only trying to help the Kuomintang to influence it and eventually replace it with the Communist Party. That is why our glorious leader Chiang Kai-shek has seen their true intentions during his time in Moscow and decided to preemptively strike against the CCP in 1927. Given our close relationship with the US and our personal story with Anticommunism it is more than necessary to denounce the USSR as the enemy of the country."

 KMT_70s_secure_soviet_borders_desc:0 "While a direct invasion is not very likely it is not a bad idea to put various efforts into the defense of our borders.

 roc.1.d:0 "Time is running out for President Li Zongren. Following Generalissimo Chiangs resignation in the face of various communist victories on the mainland, he and his supporters have now had enough of Li Zongrens ambitions and policies. Li and Chiang were never on good terms and their rivalry has proven to be disastrous for the KMT leadership during the civil war, splitting the party and the army staff further and thus allowing the communist to advance further into Nationalist areas. Li has been traveling to the US and has discredited the Generalissimo as a "dictator" and "usurper" and claiming to return to crush Chiangs movement. Chiang Kai-shek has now re-assumed his duties as President of the Republic of China, alongside with his long time friend Chen Cheng replacing former Premier Yan Xishan."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.1.d:0 "Following the last months, World War Two veteran and famous war hero Sun Li-jen has shown various signs of dissatisfaction with the Generalissimos governmental structure of the Kuomintang reign on Taiwan. Being trained in Virginia, he is Washingtons closest associate in the Republic and has been opposing the Leninist party reforms which focus on penetrating society and the military on a political level to ensure loyalty. Thanks to his connections to the United States and his successful reforms in the army, he has gained enough influence and support to topple the government of Chiang Kai-shek. In the morning hours he marched into the presidential palace alongside his loyal batalions, disarming the local guards and relieving the Generalissimo of his duties. General Sun has now declared himself provisional president of the Republic until a new government can be formed. The United States have not given an official response to this event but it is safe to assume that Washington was aware of the recent development in Taipei."

Now with the Empire defeated by our hands, Taiwan is finally under Chinese sovereignty again.\n\nHowever there is much work to do to cure the Taiwanese population from Japanese colonisation and nationalisation diseases. We will transform the island into the model of a true modern Chinese province, fulfilling the Three Principles of the People, demonstrating that only the vision of Dr.Sun can save China and not Soviet imperialism."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.3.d:0 "The great Master once said:' Failure to cultivate moral power, failure to explore what I have learned, incapacity to stand by what I know to be right, incapacity to reform what is not good -- these are my worries.'\n\nWhen the Kuomintang ruled over the mainland, it was diseased, rotten to the core and full of opportunism, corruption and various other egoistic individuals who did not believe in the cause of the National Revolutionary movement. In order to avoid such a development on Taiwan, we will start to introduce the teachings of Confucius in educational and governmental instiutions, with the focus on Self-Reflection and Self-Criticism, encouraging our people to review their actions whether they are beneficial to the Republic. Not everyone is perfect, not even our beloved President, but showing that he is staying loyal to the norms and values of Confucius and the revolution will greatly increase popular support for said teachings."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.4.d:0 "When we arrived on Taiwan, Japanese influence was strongly integrated into Taiwanese society. However it is safe to assume that the Japanese have pursued great cultural campaigns to promote the Japanese Language and sanctioning the usage of local languages. Taiwans native population shares diversity in terms of local languages but the Kuomintang government is now faced with the question whether it should also follow the Japanese way and ban local languages and emphazise Mandarin or tolerate the usage of local languages. On one hand we would gain more popular support from the native population but if Mandarin is not spread further on the Island, transforming Taiwan into the model of a modern Chinese province will prove to be more difficult and isolate us more from Chinese culture and traditions which will decrease our credibility and legitimacy as the sole government of China."

The government in Taipei claimed that it will serve as a source of reliable news and information about developments in China and spread the word about the alleged atrocities of the Communist movement on the Chinese mainland. Media scientists from the West estimate that the true purpose of the station is to spread nationalist propaganda of the Kuomintang to discredit the CCP and to legitimize the status of the Kuomintang government as the rightful and only government of the Chinese people."

Chen Cheng, former Governor of Taiwan and long-time friend of Chiang Kai-shek, has suggested to introduce various land reform based on compensation and mediation, unlike the Expropriation methods of marxist land reforms in Russia, Eastern Germany and the occupied mainland. We will adapt his advice and begin redistributing the land of Taiwanese landlords and pass them to the peasants while offering the former landlords government funds and local political positions.\n\nOur economic experts have also layed out proposals to deal with the current inflation crisis that we brought from the mainland.

When the Premier entered the room, [CHI.GetLeader] found himself in surprise when he was accompanied by another man of middle age. He introduced himself to the President as Yin Zhongrong, a cabinet member who was invited into the Kuomintang by President Li Zongren in 1949, serving so far as vice chairman of the Taiwan District Production Management Committee and chairman of the Central Trust of China Bank. He also served an important role during the transfer of the gold reserves from the mainland to Taiwan and has been responsible for the planning and use of US aid funds to the republic. The Premier argues that, although Sir K. Y. Yin is not a member of the Kuomintang, he should serve as our next minister of economic affairs. His experience in former private companies on the mainland and his idea of a 'planned market economy', focusing on import substitution and export-oriented policies, could prove beneficial to our government, as we need to build a prosperous economy to transform Taiwan into the modern model of a Chinese province.\n[CHI.GetLeader] agrees with his points and reaches out his hand to Sir Yin."

However, the rapid advances of the Communist Party on the mainland and mass desertations forced us to suspend the Constitution and establish Martial Law in the Republic until stability and order returns. With the CCP occupying the Chinese mainland and proclaiming a new government, it is only natural that the National Assembly will approve to renew the Provisions until the mainland is fully liberated from the Communist bandits."

Chiang specified that, to attract superior members, 'the reform time table should stress the importance of the party being a new organization, with new party guidelines, new demands, and new tasks.' Our goal is to defeat factionalism within the Kuomintang by sidelining the various cliques who have now lost their influence, but also taking care of uncooperative party veterans.\n\nThe Generalissimo has said the following in a private meeting with Chen Cheng: \n\n'Party members have become rude and unreasonable. In their minds they no longer care about the survival of the party and the state. I must set my mind on the task of rectifying the party so that it can survive. Without completely reforming the party, there will be no hope to save our nation.'\n\nWe will transform the Kuomintang into the united political entity it used to be during the First United Front.

They serve as the guideline for improving China during the republican era and can briefly be summarized as 'Democracy, Nationalism and Welfare'.\n\nMinzu, the first principle, advocates for developing national identity rather than an ethnical identity and calls for the Independence of the whole Chinese people from external imperialist threats and internal minority rule.\n\nMinquan, often translated as Democracy, supports the right of the Chinese people to express political opinions and to control administrative positions, which is being represented by the National Assembly. Such rights include the right to vote, recall, initiative rights and the right to hold referendum. The political system is to be divided into five seperate branches instead of just three. The state is divided into a Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuan, combining the Montesquieuan thought with Chinese tradition.\n\nMinsheng, often translated as the People's Welfare, focusing on four areas: Clothing, food, housing and mobility. This principle is also heavily influenced by the thoughts of Henry George, calling for taxation of land as "the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system."\n\nOn the mainland, we have failed to implement those principles but from now on we will put all of our resources and efforts into the completion of the national revolution under the Three Principles of the People."

Thanks to the reform effort, a new political regime was established and while we could not retake the mainland yet, we have successfully transformed the defeated and demoralized Kuomintang into a fresh new inclusive political party. The Reform Committee succesfully established a new party leadership of young and talented executives while also giving the KMT an identity and purpose as well as setting up various cadre schools to train party members in order to effectively penetrate and restructure society, economy and polity."

Originally being an anti-communist, the newspaper has seen a great increase in seperatist values and has been calling out the KMT goverment on numerous occasions, criticising the absence of constitutionalism and the extension of martial law.

Displeased with the authoritarian rule of the KMT on Taiwan, a circle around former party member Lei Chen, including famous Chinese and Taiwanese academics and politicians such as Hu Shih, Hsu-Shih-hsien, Huang Hua and Wellington Koo has been criticizing the government for their authoritarian measures and repression of the native population. As a response, Lei Chen has organised a new political movement what he calls the "China Democratic Party", demanding democratic reforms, tighter cooperation between mainlanders and native Taiwanese and peaceful anti-communism. This new party has grown to a point where it can not be ignored any further by our government and we need to decide how to approach this recent development. We could try and invite the CDL into the government but may risk that we will lose support and legitimacy for the inevitable reclaimation of the occupied mainland, which could greatly threaten our position as the sole legitimate government of China. However, forcefully disbanding the party will cause great dissent within the democratic and native factions of not only the Kuomintang but within the entire free area of the Republic of China, considering that even influential people within the Kuomintang call on Chiang to follow the constitution and not seek another term."

In order to maintain our legitimacy as the sole government of China, we can not allow any further elections until the mainland is finally liberated from the Communist bandits. Otherwise any elected circle of representatives in the free zone of the Republic would not represent the interests and desires of the entire Chinese population.

It is unknown if the government can somehow defuse this situation but given the fact that the Kuomintang lost the local support of the native people of Formosa, it seems unlikely."

After the end of the war, the rivalry between Li Zongren and Chiang Kai-shek resumed, which ultimately lead to Li resigning from the Vice Presidential office and returning to his home province of Guangxi.

They serve as the guideline for improving China during the republican era and can briefly be summarized as 'Democracy, Nationalism and Welfare'.\n\nMinzu, the first principle, advocates for developing national identity rather than an ethnical identity and calls for the Independence of the whole Chinese people from external imperialist threats and internal minority rule.\n\nMinquan, often translated as Democracy, supports the right of the Chinese people to express political opinions and to control administrative positions, which is being represented by the National Assembly. Such rights include the right to vote, recall, initiative rights and the right to hold referendum. The political system is to be divided into five seperate branches instead of just three. The state is divided into a Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuan, combining the Montesquieuan thought with Chinese tradition.\n\nMinsheng, often translated as the People's Welfare, focusing on four areas: Clothing, food, housing and mobility. This principle is also heavily influenced by the thoughts of Henry George, calling for taxation of land as "the only means of supporting the government via an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system."\n\nIn the last decades since the death of Dr. Sun, the Kuomintang has failed to implement those principles and has shown little to no believe in this philosophy anymore. But from this day on, we will put all of our resources and efforts into the completion of the national revolution under the Three Principles of the People. Every member of the party must fully commit to this and needs to keep those principles always in mind."

Their excessive propaganda campaigns and local policies almost lost us the war. The people won't forget that fast.'\n\nChiang Kai-shek leans back and puts on a light smile. He's claiming that he has learned from the past and excatly knew how to challenge this problem:\n\n'The reformation of the party was just the first step. By establishing new policies, emphazising on compromise, you will eventually satisfy the majority of people to a certain point where they will accept your reign and recognise some sort of legitimacy. It is all about finding the perfect balance of concessions and restrictions.'\n\nOf course this can't be the solution forever, he added. Times are changing and so do people. But for the time being, the Kuomintang is in a stable position in contrast to the disastrous state of 1949.

It also instigated a harsh campaign of repression against the Taiwanese people who were forbidden from discussing or remembering the events. This all increased tensions between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese.

In previous days, across the island, especially in the capital Taipei, thousands took to the street. The government deployed police and military with orders to end the protests through violence but this only caused more people to join the protests. When the government ordered troops to use live weapons, this saw many troops refuse and join the uprising. Without the support of the military, the government surrendered with many fleeing to friendly diplomatic missions or the airport in order to seek protection or flee. Newspapers in the country have announced the success of the Formosan Revolution."

In the upheaval, some former government officials and supporters managed to flee but a large number remains on the island, especially refugees who fled mainland China and the communists there. For now, the new government has stated these people will be watched closely, those who committed crimes will be dealt with and once the government establishes itself it will decide what to do with the refugees. The statement was not seen as reassuring by the refugees and many Kuomintang supporters are also concerned about the sacred mission of liberating the mainland."

They added their hope that by washing its hand of these land claims it hopes to establish friendly, neighborly ties with the communist Chinese regime but it remains committed to defending its borders from aggression.

More democratization and liberties will strengthen the state and ensure any hostile ideology or force is unable to thrive in the republic. However, there are headliners in the party who disagree and argue it was only through centralization and martial law that the republic was strong enough to defeat the threats.

If developed on our own, we would be in complete control of such weapons but it may take a long time.

The Viet Quoc should be able to better recruit and present themselves as a true party for the independence of Vietnam. The Viet Minh do not appear to be aware of our involvement in the killings."

Investigations are ongoing but the likely culprits appear to be either the French, the Chinese, or the Viet Quoc. The French view us as the primary threat but are not as established in the region. The Chinese are virulently anti-communist but are supporting the anti-colonial cause. The Viet Quoc claim to be our comrades and wish to fight together against the French but seem incapable of such sophisticated operations. Regardless, removing our officiers weakens our recruitment and combat effectiveness. We will have to monitor the situation closely."

The perceived failure to break the power of landowners and provide opportunities for peasants has long been blamed on peasant unrest and communist popularity. The failure to institute a sweeping land reform is also blamed for lackluster economic development as China continues to not reach its true agricultural capacity. However, landlords offer political and financial support for the government and breaking their power may risk empowering those groups who often oppose the KMT. The government must decide to either initiate a full-scale land reform to rectify the problem, or offer a more modest reform plan in order to provide peasant relief while also not alienating the powerful landlord classes."

The Panchen Lama is said to command his own loyal military forces and is looking for outside help. The Chinese government is willing to offer his forces arms, training, and funds on the condition that in the event the Dalai Lama refuses to accept Chinese sovereignty, he will act. This puts the Dalai Lama in a difficult position as it is now clear that he risks a potential uprising or coup if he does not follow the dictates of China."

The Chinese promise they would respect our current government and administration but wish to oversee our foreign policy and defense.

If we do accept, we will maintain a degree of autonomy and freedom of action, however, overtime, the Chinese may seek to directly occupy Tibet."
 
 TIBET_KMT.20.d:0 "The Dalai Lama received reports that major roads and strategic crossings are being blocked by armed men. It appears the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama himself in terms of spiritual importance, is orchestrating a coup. This is a direct reaction to our decision not to accept Chinese sovereignty and we suspect the Chinese are urging the Panchen Lama to act. For the Panchen Lama, he has expressed a desire for greater political authority, and it appears that is what the Chinese are promising him. He has also been organizing his own fighters and is no doubt using them in this coup attempt. Our own loyalists in Lhasa are organizing to respond, but it is unclear if we will stop the coup."
 
 KMT_MIL.2.d:0 "The Justice Investigation Bureau is the premier intelligence agency for the republic. It is directly under the executive committee but the recent war with Japan and the communists exposed its weaknesses. The organization at times appears prone to corruption and bribery. On the ground intelligence was also weak as the organization struggled to gather information of communist infiltration and movements. A new reform plan is being implemented to upgrade training, improve the organization, and increasing pay to raise morale. More importantly, the influence of military officiers will be limited to improve the ability of the JIB to investigate military matters."
 
 KMT_MIL.3.d:0 "The reforms and investigations of the Republic of China military reveals a number of high-ranking officiers are ideologically compromised or prone to corruption. The executive leadership must decide how to proceed. Some advocate a great purge be conducted to remove these negligent officers from important positions. Such drastic action may alienate the military and impact morale for the short-term, but have long-term benefits. The other possible solution would be to send these officers to difficult or isolated posts, especially in the frontier. These officiers would no longer be in a position to negatively affect the defense and be kept from achieving higher ranks. Going this route would lessen the impact on the military institutionally, but the positive impacts would not be as much as with a mass purge."
 
 KMT_MIL.4.d:0 "The executive leadership decided to deploy those officiers identified as being ideologically compromised, corrupt, or militarily inept to the frontier. This will keep these officiers from important leadership positions and often isolated from forming military cliques. These frontier positions lack many of the comforts or glory found in other postings. These officiers will now find their routes to promotion blocked and many are expected to eventually retire. Removing these officiers to the frontier will help us curb corruption and inefficiency, opening the way for more competent and patriotic officiers to take over."
 
 KMT_MIL.5.d:0 "President [CHI.GetLeader] directed military, police, and intelligence authorities to begin the mass arrest of officiers identified as being ideologically compromised, politically corrupt, or criminally incompetent for their position. This mass arrest of military officiers opens many vacancies and will cause unease within the military. However, the path for younger, patriotic, and competent officiers to take higher positions is now open. This period of arrests and purges will no doubt cause panic and organizational challenges in the military, but once it ends, the defense of the Republic of China will be far stronger."
 
 KMT_MIL.6.d:0 "The purges of military officiers by the Republic of China government appears to be ending. The last group of officiers were recently detained, tried, and sentenced. Many analysts believe it will take time for the Chinese military to re-establish morale and stability within its ranks. However, the government is confident once the newly promoted officiers gain confidence and experience, the military capabilities of the republic will be much stronger than before. There is also confidence that the purges will indicate to younger officiers and those joining the military academies that they must be professional and devoted to the nation."
 
 FRA_KMT.1.d:0 "The Republic of China privately approached our government with a request for cooperation in nuclear technology, including weaponization. The Chinese note they have access to nuclear materials and are building an extensive infrastructure. However, they are in need of French expertise and experience in the nuclear field. China is in a vital region and faces major threats from communist neighbors. If we support China, we could strengthen anti-communism in the region and assert our influence in China. Such a relationship could help protect our own interests in the region. However, supporting the Chinese may alienate the Soviets and Americans. Another issue is that some advisors question whether the benefits are worth what the Chinese would need from us."
 
 FRA_KMT.2.d:0 "The French government indicated they will aid us in our efforts to develop our nuclear program. This will be a major boon for our efforts to acquire a nuclear deterrence. More importantly, we will not be beholden to the United States and the relationship with France will be far more cooperative. We can offer France access to nuclear materials for their own programs. Our top nuclear officials plan on visiting Paris to visit their counterparts in the coming days."
 
 FRA_KMT.3.d:0 "The French government rejected our proposal for nuclear cooperation. They apparently do not see the benefits of a joint venture and alignment of interests between our states. We are not aware if the French decision is due to fears of foreign repercussions or direct threats from other powers. Regardless, it is their loss and the people of China will continue its path to nuclear deterrence. The government will redouble its efforts to support the scientists and facilities dedicated to advancing Chinese nuclear technology."
 
 KMT_Sinification.0.d:0 "The Republic of China launched an intensification of its Sinification Campaign. The government has long sought to forge national unity by spreading Chinese culture and language across all communities. Privately, one official said that all people must become Chinese or leave the country and that the day of the barbarian was over. The campaign is facing resistance, especially in the frontier provinces of China who are often not ethnically Chinese or follow their own cultural or religious traditions. The government does not appear to be overly concerned of non-Chinese backlash."
 
 KMT_VICTORY_TERROR.0.d:0 "The Republic of China government recently launched a campaign to stamp out dissent and threats to the state. The police and other state agencies have already opened investigations of politicians, writers, activists, and intellectuals accused of either sympathizing with or openly supporting enemies of the state. In particular, the focus appears to be on communist sympathizers and criminal elements. Many human rights activists are  expressing concern that this new crackdown on dissent marks a "White Terror" and will be used to crush any threat to the ruling party at the expense of individual or political rights."
 
 KMT_CULTS.0.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to legitimize the secret cults that flourish across rural China. These quasi-religious and cultural movements have existed for centuries. Many of the most powerful uprisings in Chinese history have occurred because of these cults. In recent decades, local self-defense forces have formed from these groups in the era of warlords and civil war. The Chinese government believes that by legitimizing these groups, it will bring these self-defense forces and stability provided by these groups in support of the state. However, there are fears that such groups may use this legitimization to expand their influence with the protection of the state."
 
 KMT_CULTS.1.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to crackdown and dismantle the secret cults and societies that flourish across rural China. While these groups have existed for centuries, in recent decades they began forming local self-defense forces amidst the general lawlessness from the era of warlords and civil war. By targeting these groups, the Chinese government will risk a law and order crisis until it can establish a presence in these areas. Others worry these cults may even turn into brigands and further erode law and order. Regardless, the move indicates a strong commitment by the Chinese state to assert its control over the country."
 
 KMT_SHOW_TRIALS.1.d:0 "A series of mass public trials are occurring across the Republic of China. Japanese military prisoners from the Second Sino-Japanese War and communist activists accused of crimes during the civil war are being put in open court. The government is publicizing these trials across the country and early indications indicate the courts will convict all those charged. The government is eager to demonstrate the strength of the Republic of China and provide the Chinese people justice. Opponents to the government and international observers condemn the trials as purely for show and political theatre."
 
 KMT_LAND_REFORM.1.d:0 "In a surprise decision, the Republic of China passed a new, comprehensive Land Reform Law, meant to reducing the overwhelming power of landlords and provide opportunities to peasants. For decades, the ruling KMT established strong ties with rural landlords and for years its failure to support land reform proved advantageous to the communists. The government hopes its commitment to land reform will endear peasants to the state and cut the communists from a fertile pool of recruits for their insurgency operations."
 
 KMT_LAND_REFORM.2.d:0 "The Republic of China passed a new Land Reform Law, which the government claims mark a dramatic victory for the peasants of China. However, despite their claims of achieving a major reform, many local and international observers claim the reforms are minimal. Landlords retain many loopholes and peasants will not find dramatic changes to their situation. It appears the government is not willing to lose its traditional support from the landlords who provide economic and political support to the state."
 
 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.0.d:0 "The Republic of China announced it would lift Martial Law from the country. This is part of a major reform effort within the ruling KMT party. The reformers strongly believe the restoration of constitutional and democratic rights will weaken dissent and popular support to regional leaders or communist infiltrators. Similar reforms are likely to continue, despite criticism from some of the old guard in the party that such reforms and democratization could lead to a loss of control and dissent. The decision to lift Martial Law is being largely lauded across the country."
 
 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.1.d:0 "The Republic of China passed legislation making the current Martial Law in the country permanent. This is a major victory for the KMT old guard which long argued against reformers advocating a restoration rights or democratic practices. They argue such reforms would make China weak and vulnerable to the threat of regional warlords and communist influence. The Chinese government believes continued Martial Law will keep the state strong, stop internal dissent, and help curb the influence of hostile ideologies or nations."
 
 TIBET_KMT.3.d:0 "The Republic of China strongly condemned the Dalai Lama for his naked usurpation of sovereignty from China. The Chinese government claims the Dalai Lama has illegally ceded territory and conducting foreign affairs without permission from China, who is the sovereign. The Chinese call on the Dalai Lama to cease his provocations and affirm his loyalty to China, noting that he should appreciate how much autonomy and respect he receives from the republic."
 
 TIBET_KMT.10.d:0 "In a surprise to many observers, the Republic of China signed an agreement with Tibet that recognizes its independence. The Chinese government stated its belief that the territory had been conquered by an oppressive Qing Empire and the new, democratic Chinese state could not hold on to a territory seized for the vanity of an emperor. The Tibetan government, led by the Dalai Lama, praised President [CHI.GetLeader] for his able leadership and promised a new era of peace between the two states. Many observers believe China is seeking to establish friendly ties with Tibet and keep it as a buffer state with South Asia."
 
 TIBET_KMT.5.d:0 "The leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, refused an ultimatum from the Republic of China to recognize the Chinese government as the sovereign of the country. The Chinese accuse the Dalai Lama of ceding territories and conducting affairs as a head of state and not as a subordinate to the Republic of China. The Chinese argue they are willing to give the Dalai Lama and Tibet wide autonomy, but in exchange, the Dalai Lama must stop conducting himself as an independent head of state. The Tibetan government refusal is a clear indication that the Dalai Lama is claiming complete independence from China."
 
 TIBET_KMT.6.d:0 "The Dalai Lama announced that Tibet is a sovereign part of the Republic of China and he is not a head of state. This marks an acceptance by the Dalai Lama of Chinese demands that he accept the sovereignty of the republic and halt any efforts to negotiate treaties or cede territories on his own authority. The Dalai Lama likely agreed after receiving assurances that the Chinese would provide Tibet immense autonomy and keep the current government to administer the territory for China. Some observers believe fears of a military intervention or Chinese-sponsored uprising were also factors pushing Tibet to accept the Chinese demands."
 
 TIBET_KMT.21.d:0 "The Dali Lama was overthrown in a recent coup organized by the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama, the spiritual number two of the Dalai Lama has for years harbored a desire for increased political influence. It appears armed troops loyal to him were able to secure key passes and towns, including the entrances to Lhasa. With the only recourse being a civil war, the Dalai Lama decided to instead order his loyalists to stand down. The new Tibetan government announced it will accept Chinese sovereignty on the condition Tibet retains its autonomy. Many international observers believe the Panchen Lama enjoyed the backing and even the arms of the Republic of China."
 
 TIBET_KMT.22.d:0 "An attempted coup to remove the Dali Lama in Tibet ended in failure. Fighters loyal to the Panchen Lama, spiritually second to the Dalai Lama, sought to seize control of strategic towns, passes, and entrances to Lhasa in order to force the rapid capitulation of the Dalai Lama. However, loyalists to the Dalai Lama thwarted the effort to capture areas around Lhasa and the Panchen Lama soon found his loyalists melt away once groups of pro-Dalai Lama fighters came to challenge them. In a statement the Dalai Lama claimed to have stopped a pro-Chinese attempt to seize power and pledged he would not compromise on the independence of his country. The Republic of China denied any involvement, although some photographs emerged showing the Panchen Lama fighters with Chinese rifles."
 
 TIBET_KMT.11.d:0 "A new agreement was reached between the Republic of China and India. Many of the previous disputes were removed following the Republic of China recognizing the independence of Tibet. Previously, China claimed sovereignty over Tibet and viewed itself as the sovereign to decide the border between India and Tibet. With Tibet recognized as independent, the Chinese border with India is much smaller and less in dispute. After brief negotiations the two sides were able to sign an agreement to formally settle their border. Both the Chinese and Indian government expressed hope that the new settlement will hopefully spur a renewed friendship between the largest democracies in Asia."
 
 CHI_SEATO.1.d:0 "The Republic of China agreed to join the Southeast Treaty Organization (SEATO) in order to expand its cooperation between member states and combat communist influence in the region. For the Chinese government, joining the group will expand its regional role and allow it access to local allies as it seeks to coordinate anti-communist activities in Asia. The Chinese government expressed its excitement at participating in the next SEATO Summit. The United States is especially happy for China to join as it gives the organization greater legitimacy. The Soviet Union and regional communist parties are condemning the action and accuse SEATO of being an imperialist front. Opposition members have privately told the media their concerns that SEATO may offer little material benefits and make China a larger target for international communism."
 
 TIBET_KMT.15.d:0 "The Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibet, called on the international community to defend the country following reports that the Republic of China launched an invasion. Chinese troops are reportedly streaming into Tibet with the objective of establishing Chinese control. The Chinese government claims it is not launching an invasion but is instead doing a local action to restore control over a province. The Chinese argue the Dalai Lama is an autonomous administrator, but his recent claims to being independent and efforts to negotiate territory are clear violations and he must be brought to task. The Chinese insist all efforts at a peaceful resolution were rejected by the Dalai Lama and it hopes to swiftly restore law and order for the people of Taiwan."
 
 TIBET_KMT.16.d:0 "Following the recent invasion of Tibet by the Republic of China, the traditional Tibetan aristocracy finds itself facing arrest or charges. This aristocracy has long been a major source of legitimacy, membership, and power for the Dalai Lama and his government. The Chinese decision to target this group and weaken them economically and militarily is to break the base of support for the old government. If the Dalai Lama and his allies lose bases of local support, this will strengthen efforts by the Chinese government to establish a more compliant Tibetan state. More importantly, Chinese officials brought to Tibet will also be protected from local competition. A number of Tibetan aristocrats are said to be fleeing in the direction of Nepal, India, and Burma."
 
 TIBET_KMT.105.d:0 "Following the successful coup by the Panchen Lama against the Dalai Lama, Tibet signed an agreement with the Republic of China. Tibet will be a part of China and be known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Chinese government promised to provide support for the Panchen Lama, including giving him extensive political power, in exchange for his government submitting to Chinese sovereignty. The Tibetan and Chinese government insist that the administration and governance of Tibet will remain largely the same, however, Tibet will no longer be able to conduct foreign policy or have complete control of its military forces."
 
 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.0.d:0 "As part of the recent political reforms and democratization in the Republic of China, President [CHI.GetLeader] signed a new law relinquishing a number of powers back to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan, once a rubber stamp for the ruling KMT has begun holding much more debates and passing laws without direction from the executive council. Observers believe the new reforms are turning the Legislative Yuan into a more potent political institution and check to executive power in the Republic of China."
 
 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.1.d:0 "The CC Clique faction within the KMT has seen a major drop in its influence and power within the Republic of China. Many of its prominent leaders are facing corruption charges or being removed from key posts. Media reports highlight some of the military and political failures of CC Clique leaders over the last few decades. The CC Clique represents the rightwing of the KMT and established a reputation for being virulently anti-communist, anti-Japanese. However, the new democratization reforms have opened positions to other groups and many reformers view the CC Clique as the old guard that must be replaced if China is to prosper. Reformers hope the weakening of the CC Clique will enable a smooth transition to democracy. CC Clique leaders warn rapid reforms will lead to instability and misgovernance."
 
 KMT_Atoms.1.d:0 "The Republic of China announced its full acceptance and support for the Atoms for Peace program initiated by the United States. Atoms for Peace is a program that encourages nations to learn about the risks and benefits of nuclear technology. The program provides support on education and technical assistance in developing nuclear reactors. The Chinese government believes the program will help it train nuclear scientists and develop its own nuclear technology to better reach its energy needs as it looks to a brighter future. Regional communist parties are criticizing the program as a covert means for China to acquire the means to produce nuclear weapons and accuse the United States of supporting the nuclearization of East Asia."
 
 CHI_INDO.10.d:0 "The Republic of China clearly showed its pro-French position in regard to Indochina by launching a series of military operations against Viet Minh positions along the Chinese border with Vietnam. The Chinese had stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in the region during the second World War and have extensive knowledge of Vietnamese nationalist positions. The Chinese government claims its forces are targeting the communist Viet Minh and its operations are meant to prevent the expansion of communism in the region. In response to criticism that it is supporting imperialism, the Chinese noted that not targeting the Viet Minh would only ensure the Vietnamese people replace the oppression of colonialism with the slavery of communism. The Viet Minh are said to be reeling from these strikes."
 
 ROC_VICTORY.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union and its ally Mongolia recently intervened in the Chinese Civil War to prevent the total collapse of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) as it struggled to hold back the Armed Forces of the Republic of China. After intense fighting, a ceasefire emerged, with Inner Mongolia re-establishing another Republic and the PRC setting up their government in the Beijing, its surrounding areas, and Manchuria. In the west, Sinkiang has joined East Turkestan. The rest of China, including most of its industrial base and ethnic Han population, is under the control of the Republic of China. The uneasy ceasefire is currently holding, but both sides are expected to rebuild their arsenals and plan for a future resolution of the conflict in their favor."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.15.d:0 "Efforts of restoring internal stability and harmony in the Republic of China appear to be failing as several military cliques have risen up against the government. These military cliques are reminiscent to what was seen during the Warlord Period where military leaders formed loyal forces led by officiers who shared similar professional, cultural, or territorial backgrounds. Many in China claim a Second Warlord Period has begun and there are worries of potential civil war, political instability, or a breakdown in law and order. The Chinese government claims the situation will be handled swiftly and China would not be the victims of any warlords."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.16.d:0 "Jiao Yulu, a former communist, has returned to his roots as a cult leader by proclaiming himself the heir to the Ming Empire. His claim is being backed by the popular Red Spear Society and other cults dedicated to the restoration of the Ming dynasty. The return of warlordism and rise in public distrust has seen a surge of popularity to such groups which organize local self-defense forces to combat warlords, bandits, and those deemed as corrupt government officials. The Ming pretender wants to overthrow the Republic of China to restore imperial rule, claiming the republic lacks the mandate of heaven and China needs a new dynasty. The Chinese government will have to restore public trust and respond swiftly before this monarchist movement becomes too powerful."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.1.d:0 "The powerful Hunan Clique has risen up against the republic. These military officiers, citing oppressive government actions and interventions in local affairs, want greater autonomy and a reduction of centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Hunan to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Hunan officiers are known to have established ties with the communists during the 1920s and 1930s. There are fears from the Chinese government that the Hunan Clique may use those contacts and invite the communists for military help but end up handing the region over to the enemy."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.2.d:0 "The Ningxia Ma Clique has risen against the republic. These military officiers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Ningxia to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.3.d:0 "The New Guangxi Clique has risen against the republic. One of the most powerful cliques during the 1920s and 1930s, its uprising is being viewed with great concern by the Chinese government. The Clique is rising up due to centralizing efforts and reforms targeting the cliques and old guard of the republic. The Chinese government accuses the rebelling officiers of acting out of self-interest and call on all loyal officiers to stay loyal to the republic. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Guangxi is a major population and economic base for China."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.4.d:0 "The Qinghai Ma Clique of western China has risen up against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and the oppression of cultural rights along with autonomy as the primary cause of their unrest. The Chinese government called on all officers to remain loyal and condemned the clique for seeking to stop the development of China. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Qinghai is close to disputed borders and there are already concerns the rebel officers may seek to ally with either a foreign or domestic enemy of the republic."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.5.d:0 "The Shanxi Clique has risen against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at breaking the current military organization as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal to the state. The Chinese government will seek to act fast in order to quell other uprisings and to bring order to Shanxi quickly. Shanxi sits close to the communists and there are fears local and foreign communist agitators may seek to use this conflict to expand their influence."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.6.d:0 "The Xinjiang Clique has risen against the republic. These military officers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Xinjiang to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China. The clique is noted to have had close ties with the Soviets in the past."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.7.d:0 "The Yunnan Clique has risen against the Republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at changing the current military structure of the country as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal. The Chinese government will seek to ask fast as Yunnan is strategically a vital province and has access to several foreign states who may seek to use the uprising to their advantage."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.100.d:0 "The self-proclaimed Ming emperor of China, Jiao Yulu and his coalition of militias and cultists has brought the Second Warlord Period to an end. The charismatic former communist was able to tap into the anger and frustration of rural Chinese peasants who have grown fed up with the constant fighting between the Kuomintang, communists, and warlords. The return of the warlords was the last straw for many who feared their arrival would lead to more hardship and banditry. With Jiao Yulu victorious, the Republic of China appears on the verge of either joining forces and restoring the Ming dynasty or being destroyed."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.101.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. Internationally, there are increasing calls and pressure for the government to initiate new policies to prevent such a situation from emerging again."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.102.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) announced its forces had ended the Second Warlord Period. The PRC stated the corrupt and incompetent republic had led China to the point of disintegration and ruin. It then praised the peasants and people for rising up with the Peoples Liberation Army to sweep aside the corrupt warlords and incompetent republican provincial and national officials. The PRC concluded by announcing a program to provide development, prosperity, and modernization to the peasants who have been neglected and exploited for decades."
 
 ROC_CLIQUE.103.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Republic of China managed to reunify the country despite the threat of militias, warlords, communists, and cults. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. President [CHI.GetLeader] promised to build a strong republic and lead China to its great destiny."

Being favored by the Americans, many claim that the coup was backed by the CIA and by the U.S. President, but these claims have not had any, hitherto, any backing whatsoever; it seems it will be a rumor among a plethora of rumors in the deposition of Chiang."

In a speech to his followers and critics, Chiang has promised to continue his approach of reforming the party and state, to combat corruption and suppressing communist remnants in Free China. Foreign scholars predict that Martial Law will be continued for the time being and hopes of Chinese Constitutionalism will be crushed for the following years or decades."

In addition to that, the representatives of the government of [CHI.GetLeader] claimed that the armed forces of the Republic of China need help from the western nations to defeat the communist insurgency in China via weapon shipments and advisers.

After Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself Emperor of China, a national crisis erupted and numerous provinces declared their Independence from Beijing, beginning the era of Warlordism in China. The Kuomintang found itself in Guangdong from where it began to plan an expedition to unite the country. Sun-Yat-sen, the founder of the Party, died in 1925 and after a power struggle between Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-Shek, Chiang emerged triumphant and launched the Northern Expedition to unite the country under the KMT Banner. The following ten years went down in history as the Nanjing Decade, with the Kuomintang slowly trying to establish its rule over the country. Those years eventually came to an end, following the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident of 1937, escalating into a full blown war between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. After over eight years of tough resistance, the Republic emerged victorious and regained its former provinces of Manchuria and Taiwan from the Japanese. Peace and Order however did not last long, as the conflict between the Kuomintang and the growing Communist movement resumed, dragging the country once more into war and chaos."

 Intro.1.d:0 "The Kuomintang, also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, originated from the revolutionary underground organisation Tongmenghui, founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and various other republican intellectuals who opposed the rule of the Qing Dynasty. The KMT follows the Three Principles of the People, which include Welfare, Democracy and Nationalism. After the rise of Yuan Shikai following the great revolution, the Kuomintang was banned but reorganised itself in Liangguang after the country split into various warlord regions. In order to unite the country, the KMT and the relatively small Communist Party of China formed the First United Front and defeated the Beiyang Cliques in the north, officially uniting China under the KMT Banner. However, various warlords were bribed and recruited by the KMT to maintain regional stability. Shortly after Dr. Suns death in 1925 and Chiang Kai-sheks consolidation of power, the CCP was purged from the KMT in 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Throughout the next decade until today, the KMT has been a shadow of its former self. Corruption, opportunism, factionalism and lack of popular support have brought the KMT into a terrible state. Even the Generalissimo has realised that and has announced great reforms to turn the party into the revolutionary democratic organisation it once was."

The Comintern of the Central Committee of the CCP planned that the CCP will eventually join the Kuomintang in the First United Front against the imperialist Beiyang Cliques and will afterwards try to infiltrate the KMT and turn it into a truly marxist party. However, when Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and the Wang Jingwei faction of the Kuomintang was defeated by the Chiang Kai-shek faction, the United Front broke apart and the Communist members were purged during the Shanghai massacre 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Following the next ten years, the Kuomintang tried everything to eradicate the remaining Communist bandits who escaped to Shaanxi but following the Mukden Incident of 1931 and the Shanghai Incident of 1932, anti-Japanese sentiments within the KMT have drastically increased which lead to the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek by General Zhang Xueliang in 1936, who forced the Generalissimo to join yet another united Front with the CCP against Japanese Imperialism. With the war against Japan coming to an end in 1945, it did not take long for the conflict between KMT and CCP to re-ignite. As of 1946 the Civil War continues to rage on and the Communist bandits have exponentially gained popular support from the Chinese peasants.

It allowed a small handful of upper citizens to rule over the majority of the population. Also known as the Gentry, it was an elite class in the Chinese Society which held important positions in the bureaucracy and the military and was responsible for the collection taxes and the administration of local armed forces in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1911 this concept kept living on on a more intense level during the Warlord area which saw various generals and military governors declaring their independence from the Central Government in Beijing, with their base of support being the local armed forces. The old principle of despotic hierarchy lived on and even kept itself alive during the years from 1927-1952 within the Kuomintang. Exploitation, bureaucratic capitalism, opportunism, money laundring, opium smuggle, it all contributed to the downfall of China in the modern age.\n\nLeaving 1000 year old values behind is not easy, but it is a necessary step to lead the country into the modern age.

The position is relatively weak compared to the Presidential and Premier position but could still promise us some democratic legitimacy.\n\nFirst choice is the current Examination Yuan President and son of Dr.Sun, Sun Fo. He is also known for having an "iron neck" - meaning an outspoken liberal stance against Chiang Kai-sheks authoritarian measures. As a supporter of Constitutionalism and Chinese Nationalism, Sun Fo is advocating for reforms favouring constitutional institutions and the peaceful unification with the Communist Party. While this is totally unacceptable for our policies we can't purge him due to his status as son of the father of the Republic, which also gives him great popularity among the people.\n\nFavoured by Chiang Kai-shek and his allies, Chen Cheng is the other top choice. Chen was serving as a main commander in the NRA during the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Communist campaigns, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War against the CCP. In the late phase of the civil war he was appointed Governor of Taiwan Province where he declared Martial law in order to establish a strong Nationalist stronghold on the island in case of a defeat of the Nationalist Army on the mainland. While being a staunch anti-communist and supporter of Chiang Kai-sheks policies, he is advocating for economic liberalisation and landreform in order to calm tensions between the peasants and the government, but also seeking for close cooperation with the United States as a bulwark against Socialism."
