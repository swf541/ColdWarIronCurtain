 POLITICS_CHIANG_DESC:0 "§YDirector-General of the Kuomintang, Special-Class General of the Republic of China Armed Forces §!\n§gChiang Kai-shek, born in 1887 in Fenghua, Zhejiang Province to a humble salt merchant family, initially pursued a military career in Japan before returning to China during the Xinhai Revolution. He led campaigns against the Qing Dynasty and later sought refuge in Japan during Yuan Shikai's reign. Upon returning, he formed ties with Shanghai's underworld before reuniting with his mentor Sun Yat-sen in Canton. Chiang then traveled to the Soviet Union to study the political and military methods of the Soviet Communist Party. After Sun's death, he seized leadership of the KMT through a coup against Wang Jingwei and launched the Northern Expedition to unify China under the roc.50banner. His attempted purge of the Communists Party in Shanghai sparked a civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. Despite repeated attempts to oust him, Chiang retained power through diplomatic maneuvering and backdoor shenanigans. His efforts to eradicate the Communists failed when he was kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang in 1936, leading to a truce which became known as the Second Chinese United Front. After years of war against the Japanese, Chiang's popularity, alongside the Kuomintang reputation, waned. He resumed the conflict with the Communist Party in 1946, refusing negotiations with Mao causing China to plunge back into war once again.§!"
 POLITICS_ZONGREN_DESC:0 "§YPresident of the Republic of China, Commander of the Steel Army §!\n§gBorn in the Guangxi Province in 1890, Li joined Tongmenghui, the revolutionary party of Sun Yat-sen, in 1910 but had little understanding of Sun's wider goals of reform and national reunification. In 1924 he became leader of the Guangxi clique, and in 1926 helped the KMT during their Northern expedition. This alliance was short lived however as he was expelled from KMT in 1929.\n\nIn 1937 he however reunited with the KMT to repeal the Japanese invasion as a general. He didn't become involved in the KMT politics until 1948 when he was elected the vice-president of Republic of China. In January 1949, after Chiang Kai-Shek resigned as the president, Zongren became the president of China.§!"
 POLITICS_CHEN_CHENG_DESC:0 "§gChen was serving as a main commander in the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Communist campaigns, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War against the CCP. In the late phase of the civil war he was appointed Governor of Taiwan Province where he declared Martial law in order to establish a strong Nationalist stronghold on the island in case of defeat of the Nationalist Army on the mainland. After the downfall of Li Zongren, Chiang Kai-shek reassumed the Presidency alongside with Chen Cheng replacing Yan Xishan as Premier. While being a staunch Anticommunist, Nationalist and supporter of Chiang Kai-sheks policies, he is advocating for peaceful measures via privatisation of industry, landreforms and rent cap policies in order to calm tensions between the peasants and the government in order to stop the spread of Communism.§!"
 POLITICS_CHEN_CHENG_DESC_DEMOCRATIC:0 "§gFollowing the downfall of Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng found himself in a difficult situation at first. Considering his former duties under the Generalissimo, he feared to be purged by the provisional government. The provisional government however saw the potential of his policies and allowed him to stay in politics for the unforseen future. Now he stands at the top of the Conservative Wing of the Kuomintang, following similar policies as before and advocating for closer cooperation with the West in their struggle against Communism.§!"

While he eventually quit the diplomatic service in 1956 he became a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.\n\nIn 1960 Wellington Koo returned to China and became an important figurehead within the Minquan faction advocating for closer cooperation with the West and the constitutionalization of China.§!"

Following the defeat of the CCP he became head of the secret police and was responsible for various campaigns against Communist cells. In 1965 he was promoted to Minister of Defense and worked his way all up to Prime Minister of the Republic of China. When Chiang kai-shek dies, China will be ruled by him but as of now it is unclear whether that future will continue the authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang or maybe see a shift in Chinese politics and allow the path for democratic reforms.§!"

 POLITICS_CHIANG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§gBorn in Chekiang Province, Chiang was a member of the Kuomintang (KMT) and a lieutenant of Sun Yat-sen in the revolution to overthrow the Beiyang government and reunify China.

 POLITICS_CHIANG_DESC_70s:0 "§gFollowing the final conflict against the Communist Party, Chiang won the Battle for China once and for all and goes into the history books as the Great Defender of the Nation against foreign Imperialism and Marxism. After the Kuomintangs victory he used every mean necessary to strengthen his rule over China and hunted the remaining socialist cells with brutal force, suspending the constitutional rights and freedoms while still claiming to fulfill the Three Principles of the People by Dr. Sun.\n\nWhile he has defeated all of his political enemies, Generalissimo Chiang has been ruling over the country for almost 50 years now and his high age has left him mostly unable to decide about political choices on his own. It is unsure how long he will still be the head of the Republic but it is for sure that his legacy and duties will be remembered forever in Chinese History.§!"

This cutting edge knowledge would serve him well when he made a name for himself serving in a Guangxi student militia, later climbing the ranks to become one of the most influential generals in the Warlord Era. A loyal supporter of Sun Yat-sen's vision for a democratic China, he was part of the triumvirate known as the New Guangxi Clique, which sought to overthrow Lu Rongting's regional warlord government.\nHe, alongside Li Zongren, fought against Chiang Kai-sheks government in the Central Plains War of 1930, but eventually reunited with the Generalissimo to defend the country against Japanese and Communist Aggression.

Hu Zongnan would have preferred to die for his country on the battlefields fighting the Japanese invaders.

Chiang however did not have the political ressources to take measurements against Liu.

Despite his opposition to Chiang Kai-shek, Kuo is still an anti-communist at heart but is willing to listen to the advice and orders given by the United States of America.

Yan expected to spend the rest of his life outside of politics, being seperated from his beloved home Shanxi for the unforseen future. However, when General Sun Li-jen marched into the Presidential Palace in Taipei and deposed Chiang Kai-sheks government, everything changed yet again for Yan. The provisional government has decided to appoint him as temporary Premier of the Republic until the end of Military rule, reasoning that his mediation skills between Li Zongren and Chiang Kai-shek during the civil war could prove effective for the integration of the old government of Chiang Kai-shek. Maybe this will be the opportunity for Yan to start a political development that could eventually lead to his return to Shanxi, whether that'd be through diplomacy or war.§!"

Zhang advocated for the implementation of a social democratic political structure in China after the social democratic model of the German SPD with strong commitments to human rights, seperation of powers, nationalisation of major industries such as railroads and mines. Displeased with the unconstitutional reign of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, he left the country for the United States but returned after the Anti-Chiang coup and has joined the social liberal circle around Sun Fo, becoming a close associate of him which eventually lead up to him being appointed the Premier of the Republic.§!"
 POLITICS_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "§gSun Fo, also known by some as Zhesheng, has to be one of the most prominent and most symbolic members of the Kuomintang. Being the son of Sun Yat-sen, the father of the revolution of 1911, the father and first president of the Republic and founder of the Kuomintang, Sun Fo has quite an impressive parental background to look at. Having served in the Nationalist government under his father but also Chiang Kai-shek in various ministries and other positions, he became one of the most high-ranking officials in the Kuomintang. However due to his liberal and nationalist believes, inspired by his father, he had multiple arguments and fallouts with former chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarding the question of constitutional government and negotiations with the Communist Party in the face of Japanese Aggression. After the departure of the Nationalist government to Taiwan, he left the country in 1952 but like many other liberal-minded scholars he returned after the deposition of Chiang and immediately became the top candidate of the social liberal camp in the Kuomintang.§!"
 POLITICS_LEI_CHEN_DESC:0 "§gBefore moving to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government, Lei Chen played an important role in the reorganisation of the China Youth Party and the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party during the 1946 National Assembly Session and the first Legislative Yuan Elections of 1947. Already before his departure to Taiwan, he as well as Hu Shi, Wang Shiije and Hang Liwu prepared to publish the newspaper "Free China", which was however delayed due to the Communist crossing of the Yangtze River. While maintaining good relations with Chiang Kai-shek at first and supporting his political plans, Lei criticized the authoritarian measures of the government. He was dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek from his position of Political Advisor to the President and was facing expulsion from the Kuomintang. With the Generalissimo being ousted from power and civilian governance returning, Lei Chen has won the recent election as the head of his newly founded China Democratic Party. Although his party does not hold the absolute majority, it is expected that Lei's presidency will see fundamental changes in governmental strucutre of the Republic of China.§!"

We will start by appointing Hsieh Tung-min to governor of Taiwan who was born on Taiwan during the Japanese reign but decided to leave the Island in the 1920 to join the Kuomintang on the mainland. While we needed hardline anti-communists in key positions during the consolidation area following the years after the end of the civil war we should now encourage less radical and locally known people to replace them.

Instead of creating the missbelieve that the Chinese people are superior to the rest of the world we should emphasize the thought of patriotism, meaning that you can be proud of your country while not expressing any superior thoughts and the desire to go to war for your nation.

While Dr. Sun and even Chiang Ching-kuo saw certain effective aspects such as the organisation of the armed forces or the way of carrying out an anti-imperialist revolution it was clear that the CPSU was only trying to help the Kuomintang to influence it and eventually replace it with the Communist Party. That is why our glorious leader Chiang Kai-shek has seen their true intentions during his time in Moscow and decided to preemptively strike against the CCP in 1927. Given our close relationship with the US and our personal story with Anticommunism it is more than necessary to denounce the USSR as the enemy of the country."

 #KMT on Taiwan 50s Events#

 roc.1.t:0 "Chiang Kai-shek reassumes the Presidency"
 roc.1.d:0 "Time is running out for President Li Zongren. Following Generalissimo Chiangs resignation in the face of various communist victories on the mainland, he and his supporters have now had enough of Li Zongrens ambitions and policies. Li and Chiang were never on good terms and their rivalry has proven to be disastrous for the KMT leadership during the civil war, splitting the party and the army staff further and thus allowing the communist to advance further into Nationalist areas. Li has been traveling to the US and has discredited the Generalissimo as a "dictator" and "usurper" and claiming to return to crush Chiangs movement. Chiang Kai-shek has now re-assumed his duties as President of the Republic of China, alongside with his long time friend Chen Cheng replacing former Premier Yan Xishan."
 roc.1.a:0 "Welcome back!"

 KMT_Taiwan50s.1.t:0 "Sun Li-jen seizes Power"
 KMT_Taiwan50s.1.d:0 "Following the last months, World War Two veteran and famous war hero Sun Li-jen has shown various signs of dissatisfaction with the Generalissimos governmental structure of the Kuomintang reign on Taiwan. Being trained in Virginia, he is Washingtons closest associate in the Republic and has been opposing the Leninist party reforms which focus on penetrating society and the military on a political level to ensure loyalty. Thanks to his connections to the United States and his successful reforms in the army, he has gained enough influence and support to topple the government of Chiang Kai-shek. In the morning hours he marched into the presidential palace alongside his loyal batalions, disarming the local guards and relieving the Generalissimo of his duties. General Sun has now declared himself provisional president of the Republic until a new government can be formed. The United States have not given an official response to this event but it is safe to assume that Washington was aware of the recent development in Taipei."
 KMT_Taiwan50s.1.a:0 "My allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!"

 KMT_Taiwan50s.2.t:0 "The Sinicization of Taiwan"
 KMT_Taiwan50s.2.d:0 "Over fifty years ago, the Qing Dynasty ceded the island of Taiwan to the Japanese Empire after their defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war of 1895. Now with the Empire defeated by our hands, Taiwan is finally under Chinese sovereignty again.\n\nHowever there is much work to do to cure the Taiwanese population from Japanese colonisation and nationalisation diseases. We will transform the island into the model of a true modern Chinese province, fulfilling the Three Principles of the People, demonstrating that only the vision of Dr.Sun can save China and not Soviet imperialism."
 KMT_Taiwan50s.2.a:0 "Death to Imperalism!"

 KMT_Taiwan50s.3.t:0 "The Importance of New Confucianism"
 KMT_Taiwan50s.3.d:0 "The great Master once said:' Failure to cultivate moral power, failure to explore what I have learned, incapacity to stand by what I know to be right, incapacity to reform what is not good -- these are my worries.'\n\nWhen the Kuomintang ruled over the mainland, it was diseased, rotten to the core and full of opportunism, corruption and various other egoistic individuals who did not believe in the cause of the National Revolutionary movement. In order to avoid such a development on Taiwan, we will start to introduce the teachings of Confucius in educational and governmental instiutions, with the focus on Self-Reflection and Self-Criticism, encouraging our people to review their actions whether they are beneficial to the Republic. Not everyone is perfect, not even our beloved President, but showing that he is staying loyal to the norms and values of Confucius and the revolution will greatly increase popular support for said teachings."
 KMT_Taiwan50s.3.a:0 "A wise Lesson."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.4.t:0 "The Language Problem"
 KMT_Taiwan50s.4.d:0 "When we arrived on Taiwan, Japanese influence was strongly integrated into Taiwanese society. However it is safe to assume that the Japanese have pursued great cultural campaigns to promote the Japanese Language and sanctioning the usage of local languages. Taiwans native population shares diversity in terms of local languages but the Kuomintang government is now faced with the question whether it should also follow the Japanese way and ban local languages and emphazise Mandarin or tolerate the usage of local languages. On one hand we would gain more popular support from the native population but if Mandarin is not spread further on the Island, transforming Taiwan into the model of a modern Chinese province will prove to be more difficult and isolate us more from Chinese culture and traditions which will decrease our credibility and legitimacy as the sole government of China."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.5.d:0 "Today the Broadcasting Corporation of China has made its way to the mainland of China from Taiwan through bypassing the Chinese Communist Party's strong grip over broadcasting stations. The Voice of Free China is an international radio station of the Republic of China that operated from October 10, 1949 onwards, and has since served as the Republic of China's source of propaganda which attacked the Central People's Broadcasting Station and China Radio International and denounced the illegitimacy of the Communist Government on the mainland. The Overseas Broadcasting Department of the China Broadcasting Corporation officially began to broadcast to the outside world under the call sign " Voice of Free China ". Initially, it was only in Chinese and English . and Japanese broadcasts, and later added Korean , French , German , Spanish , Russian , Arabic , Vietnamese , Indonesian and other languages. It is clear that the Chinese Nationalist's infiltration of propaganda on the mainland will not be well-received by the Chinese Communists."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.6.d:0 "The Ministry of Economic Affairs has come to the conclusion that the government has to take drastic measures to stabilise the current economic situation on Taiwan Island, reaching from Inflation policies to Agricultural Policies which also will have a crucial impact on the political input and feedback of the citizens of the Republic.\n\nThe Central Reform Committee came to the conclusion that favouring the Landlords and ignoring the demands of the peasants was a major factor in the downfall of Nationalist governance on the mainland. Chen Cheng, former Governor of Taiwan and long-time friend of Chiang Kai-shek, has suggested to introduce various land reform based on compensation and mediation, unlike the Expropriation methods of marxist land reforms in Russia, Eastern Germany and the occupied mainland. We will adapt his advice and begin redistributing the land of Taiwanese landlords and pass them to the peasants while offering the former landlords government funds and local political positions.\n\nOur economic experts have also layed out proposals to deal with the current inflation crisis that we brought from the mainland. Luckily, many plans emphazising currency reforms to curb the hyperinflation had already started prior to this."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.7.d:0 "In the morning hours of Taipei, [CHI.GetLeader] was awaiting the Premier, who has proven himself to the President as a valuable ally, thanks to his successful agricultural and fiscal reform campaigns. When the Premier entered the room, [CHI.GetLeader] found himself in surprise when he was accompanied by another man of middle age. He introduced himself to the President as Yin Zhongrong, a cabinet member who was invited into the Kuomintang by President Li Zongren in 1949, serving so far as vice chairman of the Taiwan District Production Management Committee and chairman of the Central Trust of China Bank. He also served an important role during the transfer of the gold reserves from the mainland to Taiwan and has been responsible for the planning and use of US aid funds to the republic. The Premier argues that, although Sir K. Y. Yin is not a member of the Kuomintang, he should serve as our next minister of economic affairs. His experience in former private companies on the mainland and his idea of a 'planned market economy', focusing on import substitution and export-oriented policies, could prove beneficial to our government, as we need to build a prosperous economy to transform Taiwan into the modern model of a Chinese province.\n[CHI.GetLeader] agrees with his points and reaches out his hand to Sir Yin."
 KMT_Taiwan50s.7.a:0 "Mr. Yin, we will watch your career with great interest."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.8.t:0 "The Temporary Provisions"
 KMT_Taiwan50s.8.d:0 "When the Constitution of the Republic of China was drafted and adopted by the National Assembly in 1947, it sparked great joy and hopes within the government to finally stabilise China and begin the third phase of Dr. Sun Yat-sens revolution, calling for the progress of constitutionalism. However, the rapid advances of the Communist Party on the mainland and mass desertations forced us to suspend the Constitution and establish Martial Law in the Republic until stability and order returns. With the CCP occupying the Chinese mainland and proclaiming a new government, it is only natural that the National Assembly will approve to renew the Provisions until the mainland is fully liberated from the Communist bandits."

 KMT_Taiwan50s.9.d:0 "Generalissimo Chiang believes that the cause of defeat in the Civil War did not come from military strength, but bureaucratic and institutional disunity. Chiang specified that, to attract superior members, 'the reform time table should stress the importance of the party being a new organization, with new party guidelines, new demands, and new tasks.' Our goal is to defeat factionalism within the Kuomintang by sidelining the various cliques who have now lost their influence, but also taking care of uncooperative party veterans.\n\nThe Generalissimo has said the following in a private meeting with Chen Cheng: \n\n'Party members have become rude and unreasonable. In their minds they no longer care about the survival of the party and the state. I must set my mind on the task of rectifying the party so that it can survive. Without completely reforming the party, there will be no hope to save our nation.'\n\nWe will transform the Kuomintang into the united political entity it used to be during the First United Front. We will especially focus on sidelining corrupt and uncooperative officials, as well as ending party factionalism and recruitment of the local Taiwanese population."

They serve as the guideline for improving China during the republican era and can briefly be summarized as 'Democracy, Nationalism and Welfare'.\n\nMinzu, the first principle, advocates for developing national identity rather than an ethnical identity and calls for the Independence of the whole Chinese people from external imperialist threats and internal minority rule.\n\nMinquan, often translated as Democracy, supports the right of the Chinese people to express political opinions and to control administrative positions, which is being represented by the National Assembly. Such rights include the right to vote, recall, initiative rights and the right to hold referendum. The political system is to be divided into five seperate branches instead of just three. The state is divided into a Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuan, combining the Montesquieuan thought with Chinese tradition.\n\nMinsheng, often translated as the People's Welfare, focusing on four areas: Clothing, food, housing and mobility. This principle is also heavily influenced by the thoughts of Henry George, calling for taxation of land as "the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system."\n\nOn the mainland, we have failed to implement those principles but from now on we will put all of our resources and efforts into the completion of the national revolution under the Three Principles of the People."

Thanks to the reform effort, a new political regime was established and while we could not retake the mainland yet, we have successfully transformed the defeated and demoralized Kuomintang into a fresh new inclusive political party. The Reform Committee succesfully established a new party leadership of young and talented executives while also giving the KMT an identity and purpose as well as setting up various cadre schools to train party members in order to effectively penetrate and restructure society, economy and polity."

His newspaper featured various political ideas that pose a serious threat to our government, including native autonomy, democratic elections and the abolishment of the one-party state. Originally being an anti-communist, the newspaper has seen a great increase in seperatist values and has been calling out the KMT goverment on numerous occasions, criticising the absence of constitutionalism and the extension of martial law.

Displeased with the authoritarian rule of the KMT on Taiwan, a circle around former party member Lei Chen, including famous Chinese and Taiwanese academics and politicians such as Hu Shih, Hsu-Shih-hsien, Huang Hua and Wellington Koo has been criticizing the government for their authoritarian measures and repression of the native population. As a response, Lei Chen has organised a new political movement what he calls the "China Democratic Party", demanding democratic reforms, tighter cooperation between mainlanders and native Taiwanese and peaceful anti-communism. This new party has grown to a point where it can not be ignored any further by our government and we need to decide how to approach this recent development. We could try and invite the CDL into the government but may risk that we will lose support and legitimacy for the inevitable reclaimation of the occupied mainland, which could greatly threaten our position as the sole legitimate government of China. However, forcefully disbanding the party will cause great dissent within the democratic and native factions of not only the Kuomintang but within the entire free area of the Republic of China, considering that even influential people within the Kuomintang call on Chiang to follow the constitution and not seek another term."

In order to maintain our legitimacy as the sole government of China, we can not allow any further elections until the mainland is finally liberated from the Communist bandits. Otherwise any elected circle of representatives in the free zone of the Republic would not represent the interests and desires of the entire Chinese population. And because of said reasoning, the Kuomintang government has decided to postpone the election of the Legislative Yuan, keeping the old representative circle from the mainland in charge."

One of the most prominent being Sun Li-jen, but due to our reliance on the United States and his status as a war hero, we couldn't take any moves against him. But today a handful of his subordinates were arrested and interrogated by Ching-kuos secret police.

Reports from our local advisers indicate that the general has been arrested by the Secret Police, following a confession of a subordinate spying for the Chinese Communist Party.

With the old government removed we began laying the groundwork for a liberal, equal and tolerant atmosphere on Taiwan and will continue to do so. However it is still up to debate whether we include the native population within the bureaucratic structure of the Republic or keep our mainland staff for the time being.

The next day, only one convoy succeeded in resupplying the island, with the rest getting repelled by the constant shellings. n/n/ The United States have come up with a new solution to bypass the blockade, with an emphasis on Airdropping supplies onto the islands, which were small before but could be relied on with better American air cover."

They serve as the guideline for improving China during the republican era and can briefly be summarized as 'Democracy, Nationalism and Welfare'.\n\nMinzu, the first principle, advocates for developing national identity rather than an ethnical identity and calls for the Independence of the whole Chinese people from external imperialist threats and internal minority rule.\n\nMinquan, often translated as Democracy, supports the right of the Chinese people to express political opinions and to control administrative positions, which is being represented by the National Assembly. Such rights include the right to vote, recall, initiative rights and the right to hold referendum. The political system is to be divided into five seperate branches instead of just three. The state is divided into a Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuan, combining the Montesquieuan thought with Chinese tradition.\n\nMinsheng, often translated as the People's Welfare, focusing on four areas: Clothing, food, housing and mobility. This principle is also heavily influenced by the thoughts of Henry George, calling for taxation of land as "the only means of supporting the government via an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system."\n\nIn the last decades since the death of Dr. Sun, the Kuomintang has failed to implement those principles and has shown little to no believe in this philosophy anymore. But from this day on, we will put all of our resources and efforts into the completion of the national revolution under the Three Principles of the People. Every member of the party must fully commit to this and needs to keep those principles always in mind."

Their excessive propaganda campaigns and local policies almost lost us the war. The people won't forget that fast.'\n\nChiang Kai-shek leans back and puts on a light smile. He's claiming that he has learned from the past and excatly knew how to challenge this problem:\n\n'The reformation of the party was just the first step. By establishing new policies, emphazising on compromise, you will eventually satisfy the majority of people to a certain point where they will accept your reign and recognise some sort of legitimacy. It is all about finding the perfect balance of concessions and restrictions.'\n\nOf course this can't be the solution forever, he added. Times are changing and so do people.

After what happened at Xi'an, Chiang arrested Zhang shortly afterwards placing him under house arrest for treason against the Kuomintang, stopping him from managing to defect to the Communists.

Although Free China was founded as an independent publication free to discuss issues openly and act as a contrast to the harshness of the communist controlled media, the Kuomintang has found recent publications in Free China to be dangerous. Specifically, several articles have criticized the Kuomintang for not following constitutional procedures, especially in terms of term limits and the government felt Lei Chen was behind these criticisms. Lei Chen is a noted supporter of the constitution even at the expense of the Kuomintang and it appears this stance has cost him his party membership.

Protests against corruption and the assault of a widow by state officials resulted in the deployment of troops who killed thousands to end the protests. It also instigated a harsh campaign of repression against the Taiwanese people who were forbidden from discussing or remembering the events. This all increased tensions between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. Many Taiwanese have not forgotten and continue to see the events as a clear example of the corruption and brutality of the mainland Chinese Kuomintang. They also see it as proof as to why Taiwan must be free and independent to control its own destiny."

 Formosa.11.d:0 "In a stunning development in the Republic of China, the ruling government has collapsed to an uprising led by Taiwanese resentful at the domination and control of their island following the arrival of the Kuomintang from mainland China after their defeat during the Chinese Civil War. In previous days, across the island, especially in the capital Taipei, thousands took to the street. The government deployed police and military with orders to end the protests through violence but this only caused more people to join the protests. When the government ordered troops to use live weapons, this saw many troops refuse and join the uprising. Without the support of the military, the government surrendered with many fleeing to friendly diplomatic missions or the airport in order to seek protection or flee. Newspapers in the country have announced the success of the Formosan Revolution."

 Formosa.12.d:0 "The recent Formosan Revolution saw the island population from before the arrival of the Kuomintang in 1945 finally take control of the island for themselves. The successful revolutionaries recently announced the establishment of a new Provisional Government of Formosa to transition the island to a new era of inclusive and just governance. In the upheaval, some former government officials and supporters managed to flee but a large number remains on the island, especially refugees who fled mainland China and the communists there. For now, the new government has stated these people will be watched closely, those who committed crimes will be dealt with and once the government establishes itself it will decide what to do with the refugees. The statement was not seen as reassuring by the refugees and many Kuomintang supporters are also concerned about the sacred mission of liberating the mainland."

 Formosa.100.d:0 "The new state of Formosa recently announced in a national broadcast that it has rescinded all claims to mainland China. It stated the nation would no longer be devoting its efforts and sacrificing its resources for a cause that held little importance beyond the refugees and Kuomintang loyalists. Formosa is only concerned about the welfare, safety, and development of its own people. They added their hope that by washing its hand of these land claims it hopes to establish friendly, neighborly ties with the communist Chinese regime but it remains committed to defending its borders from aggression. A formal response from Beijing has not come but many analysts believe the Formosa announcement will likely not change the stance of the mainland Chinese government that the island is a province of China and should be returned to the country."

The two countries are expected to discuss expanding defense cooperation, trade, and the regional security environment. President [USA.GetLeader] is will meet leading government officials and is expected to visit cultural sites across the country. The communist Chinese government released its own statement condemning the United States for interfering with the internal affairs of China and reiterated that it would soon bring the rebellious island back.

 CHI_KMT.1.d:0 "The KMT stands at a crossroads. In recent years it survived a war with Japan and a massive communist resurgence that nearly overthrew the regime. Many reform-minded in the party are now saying the moment is right to initiate reforms and change the course of the party. They blame corruption, incompetence and lack of morale as the reason why Japan and the communists were able to thrive. More radical reforms will strengthen the state and ensure any hostile ideology or force is unable to thrive in the republic. However, there are oppositions in the party, mostly anti-reformist factions who benefit from the current system who disagree and argue it was only through centralization and martial law that the republic was strong enough to defeat the threats. They argue China must continue on this path in order to complete its independence and unification.

The Chinese government hopes nuclear energy could play a major role in meeting future energy demands as all of China advances. However, the institute will also consider the private development of nuclear weapons. The question will be whether China seeks to develop such weapons on its own or by asking the Americans for help. If developed on our own, we would be in complete control of such weapons but it may take a long time. Bringing the Americans would accelerate the development but limit our independence and ability to gear the program to our situation. We must decide which route to take as the communists are no doubt developing their own bomb."

The party, which was less successful among peasants and industrial workers, was organised in small clandestine cells. Experts have predicted Chinese involvement in Vu-hong-Khanhs nationalist movement beforehand, given the Anti-Imperialist course of the Nanjing government, which only views the Northern Rebels as puppets of the Soviet Union and remains skeptical of Western influence in Southern Vietnam.

An approachment to the Southeast Asian nations was made to introduce a Dual-Nationality treaty with these countries to allow the Chinese migrants a choice to return back to the mainland or continue to reside in the region.

Many are military units which disserted or armed militias ravaging the countryside. These bandits commit unspeakable crimes on travelers and raid goods moving along the roads. The KMT government will have to address this crisis in order to restart internal trade and better unify the country. For many peasants, it is the local warlords they look to for protection from the bandits, not the government. If the bandit problem is not addressed, popular support and the economy will rapidly erode."

 CHI_VIN.0.d:0 "As part of our policy of backing the anti-colonial Viet Quoc, our intelligence agents have begun quietly assassinating Viet Minh officiers. The communist Viet Minh are another major anti-colonial Vietnamese party and they compete with the Viet Quoc for legitimacy and recruitment. Removing their officiers will hinder their ability to recruit more fighters or establish organized bands of fighters. The Viet Quoc should be able to better recruit and present themselves as a true party for the independence of Vietnam. The Viet Minh do not appear to be aware of our involvement in the killings."

 CHI_VIN.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, a number of our officiers have been assassinated, mostly in our bases along the Chinese border. Investigations are ongoing but the likely culprits appear to be either the French, the Chinese, or the Viet Quoc. The French view us as the primary threat but are not as established in the region. The Chinese are virulently anti-communist but are supporting the anti-colonial cause. The Viet Quoc claim to be our comrades and wish to fight together against the French but seem incapable of such sophisticated operations. Regardless, removing our officiers weakens our recruitment and combat effectiveness. We will have to monitor the situation closely."

 KMT_LAND_REFORM.0.d:0 "One of the biggest issues facing the Republic of China, since its earliest days, has been the issue of land reform. The perceived failure to break the power of landowners and provide opportunities for peasants has long been blamed on peasant unrest and communist popularity. The failure to institute a sweeping land reform is also blamed for lackluster economic development as China continues to not reach its true agricultural capacity. However, landlords offer political and financial support for the government and breaking their power may risk empowering those groups who often oppose the KMT. The government must decide to either initiate a full-scale land reform to rectify the problem, or offer a more modest reform plan in order to provide peasant relief while also not alienating the powerful landlord classes."



 TIBET_KMT.100.d:0 "The Republic of China recognizes the Panchen Lama, seen as spiritually second only to the Dalai Lama, is increasingly seeking a more prominent political role. The Panchen Lama is said to command his own loyal military forces and is looking for outside help. The Chinese government is willing to offer his forces arms, training, and funds on the condition that in the event the Dalai Lama refuses to accept Chinese sovereignty, he will act. This puts the Dalai Lama in a difficult position as it is now clear that he risks a potential uprising or coup if he does not follow the dictates of China."

 TIBET_KMT.4.d:0 "The Republic of China has requested we accept their sovereignty over our lands. The Chinese promise they would respect our current government and administration but wish to oversee our foreign policy and defense. If we do not accept this demand, we risk some overt or covert attempt to change our mind. But we would have a chance to maintain our independence. If we do accept, we will maintain a degree of autonomy and freedom of action, however, overtime, the Chinese may seek to directly occupy Tibet."

 TIBET_KMT.20.d:0 "The Dalai Lama received reports that major roads and strategic crossings are being blocked by armed men. It appears the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama himself in terms of spiritual importance, is orchestrating a coup. This is a direct reaction to our decision not to accept Chinese sovereignty and we suspect the Chinese are urging the Panchen Lama to act. For the Panchen Lama, he has expressed a desire for greater political authority, and it appears that is what the Chinese are promising him. He has also been organizing his own fighters and is no doubt using them in this coup attempt. Our own loyalists in Lhasa are organizing to respond, but it is unclear if we will stop the coup."

 KMT_MIL.2.d:0 "The Justice Investigation Bureau is the premier intelligence agency for the republic. It is directly under the executive committee but the recent war with Japan and the communists exposed its weaknesses. The organization at times appears prone to corruption and bribery. On the ground intelligence was also weak as the organization struggled to gather information of communist infiltration and movements. A new reform plan is being implemented to upgrade training, improve the organization, and increasing pay to raise morale. More importantly, the influence of military officiers will be limited to improve the ability of the JIB to investigate military matters."

 KMT_MIL.3.d:0 "The reforms and investigations of the Republic of China military reveals a number of high-ranking officiers are ideologically compromised or prone to corruption. The executive leadership must decide how to proceed. Some advocate a great purge be conducted to remove these negligent officers from important positions. Such drastic action may alienate the military and impact morale for the short-term, but have long-term benefits. The other possible solution would be to send these officers to difficult or isolated posts, especially in the frontier. These officiers would no longer be in a position to negatively affect the defense and be kept from achieving higher ranks. Going this route would lessen the impact on the military institutionally, but the positive impacts would not be as much as with a mass purge."

 KMT_MIL.4.d:0 "The executive leadership decided to deploy those officers identified as being ideologically compromised, corrupt, or militarily inept to the frontier. This will keep these officiers from important leadership positions and often isolated from forming military cliques. These frontier positions lack many of the comforts or glory found in other postings. These officiers will now find their routes to promotion blocked and many are expected to eventually retire. Removing these officiers to the frontier will help us curb corruption and inefficiency, opening the way for more competent and patriotic officiers to take over."

 KMT_MIL.5.d:0 "President [CHI.GetLeader] directed military, police, and intelligence authorities to begin the mass arrest of officiers identified as being ideologically compromised, politically corrupt, or criminally incompetent for their position. This mass arrest of military officiers opens many vacancies and will cause unease within the military. However, the path for younger, patriotic, and competent officiers to take higher positions is now open. This period of arrests and purges will no doubt cause panic and organizational challenges in the military, but once it ends, the defense of the Republic of China will be far stronger."

 KMT_MIL.6.d:0 "The purges of military officiers by the Republic of China government appears to be ending. The last group of officiers were recently detained, tried, and sentenced. Many analysts believe it will take time for the Chinese military to re-establish morale and stability within its ranks. However, the government is confident once the newly promoted officiers gain confidence and experience, the military capabilities of the republic will be much stronger than before. There is also confidence that the purges will indicate to younger officiers and those joining the military academies that they must be professional and devoted to the nation."

Falkenhausen has gained prominence in the late stages of World War Two, having contacts to the 20th July Conspiracy, causing him to be arrested by the Gestapo. After the war, he served as a witness at the Nurembourg Trials. Despite being sentenced for 12 years of Forced Labour, Falkenhausen was released just 3 weeks after his sentence, moving to the Inner-German border near the mansion of his old friend Franz von Papen.\n\nSending Falkenhausen to China yet again would re-establish and deepen our relations with the Kuomintang and assist them in their inevitable reconquest of Northern China."

  KMT_MIL.8.d:0 "The training brigade is an important part of the Sixty Division plan. As a demonstration unit, it will become a model for the new modern Chinese army. Through careful design and execution, the training brigade will demonstrate the most advanced tactics, strategy and leadership capabilities, becoming the cradle of cultivating and molding outstanding military talents. As this new model adopt by more new units, it will help improve the combat effectiveness and combat efficiency of the entire Chinese military, allowing it to remain competitive in modern military conflicts and make positive contributions to the country's security and development."

 KMT_MIL.9.d:0 "As a model and experimental subject of military reform, the training brigade has finally created the most suitable military structure for China. Now, we can use this as a template to start the training of the Sixty Division. The establishment of this military structure is the result of repeated trials and adjustments in practice. Through the efforts of the training brigade, we have found the most effective organizational structure and combat mode, which will bring higher combat effectiveness and combat efficiency to our army."

 KMT_MIL.10.d:0 "As the Sixty Division plan comes to an end, the sixty elite divisions which with the training brigade as model and the adoption of new military structure, would be the backbone of the modernized Chinese military, and the reliance on defeating the Communist Party in Manchuria in the future. The Sixty Division Plan also marks an important milestone in the transformation of the Chinese military. It marks a great achievement in the modernization of our military and brings new improvements to our national defense capabilities. This transformation is not only a technical and structural update, but also a redefinition of our military's combat effectiveness and strategic positioning, opening a new chapter for our country's security and development."

 KMT_MIL.11.d:0 "In our pursuit to reform and address the deficiencies of the US Armed Forces structure, the most logical approach involves tapping into the expertise of those intimately familiar with the intricacies of the system - the military advisors from the US Army. Fortunately, leveraging the influence of the China Lobby and our connections with pro-ROC generals such as Wedemeyer, we have successfully secured the assistance of a group of US Military Advisors to aid in our military reform efforts. This collaboration represents a significant opportunity for us to benefit from the knowledge and experience of seasoned professionals, thereby accelerating our progress towards achieving a more robust and efficient military structure."

 KMT_MIL.12.d:0 "Clearly, China remains a nation grappling with developmental challenges, and this reality extends even to the realm of military logistics. The complexity and sophistication of the US Armed Forces structure heavily rely on robust supply chains and well-established infrastructure, elements that are currently lacking in our military framework. Addressing the shortcomings of the US Armed Forces structure necessitates a fundamental overhaul of our logistical systems, only when we achieve sufficient supply can we expect the US Armed Forces structure to function optimally and effectively support our military operations. Thus, improving our logistical system stands as the crucial initial step toward aligning with the standards and requirements of the US Armed Forces structure."

 KMT_MIL.13.d:0 "As time progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that traditional approaches no longer suffice for the evolving needs of our military. Hence, we are diligently crafting novel methodologies tailored to meet the present demands and sustain the effectiveness of our army's structure. This proactive initiative underscores our commitment to adaptability and continuous improvement in ensuring the optimal functioning of our armed forces amidst changing circumstances."

 KMT_MIL.14.d:0 "As the Ninety Division plan concludes, the envisioned ninety divisions, each tailored for specific roles and supported by an overhauled logistical network, are poised to become the cornerstone of China's modernized military. Their strategic significance extends to countering Communist influence in Manchuria and beyond. This plan represents a pivotal moment in the modernization journey of the Chinese army, addressing key deficiencies inherited from the adoption of the US military structure.

 FRA_KMT.1.d:0 "The Republic of China privately approached our government with a request for cooperation in nuclear technology, including weaponization. The Chinese note they have access to nuclear materials and are building an extensive infrastructure. However, they are in need of French expertise and experience in the nuclear field. China is in a vital region and faces major threats from communist neighbors. If we support China, we could strengthen anti-communism in the region and assert our influence in China. Such a relationship could help protect our own interests in the region. However, supporting the Chinese may alienate the Soviets and Americans. Another issue is that some advisors question whether the benefits are worth what the Chinese would need from us."

 FRA_KMT.2.d:0 "The French government indicated they will aid us in our efforts to develop our nuclear program. This will be a major boon for our efforts to acquire a nuclear deterrence. More importantly, we will not be beholden to the United States and the relationship with France will be far more cooperative. We can offer France access to nuclear materials for their own programs. Our top nuclear officials plan on visiting Paris to visit their counterparts in the coming days."

 FRA_KMT.3.d:0 "The French government rejected our proposal for nuclear cooperation. They apparently do not see the benefits of a joint venture and alignment of interests between our states. We are not aware if the French decision is due to fears of foreign repercussions or direct threats from other powers. Regardless, it is their loss and the people of China will continue its path to nuclear deterrence. The government will redouble its efforts to support the scientists and facilities dedicated to advancing Chinese nuclear technology."

 KMT_Sinification.0.d:0 "The Republic of China launched an intensification of its Sinification Campaign. The government has long sought to forge national unity by spreading Chinese culture and language across all communities. Privately, one official said that all people must become Chinese or leave the country and that the day of the barbarian was over. The campaign is facing resistance, especially in the frontier provinces of China who are often not ethnically Chinese or follow their own cultural or religious traditions. The government does not appear to be overly concerned of non-Chinese backlash."

 KMT_VICTORY_TERROR.0.d:0 "The Republic of China government recently launched a campaign to stamp out dissent and threats to the state. The police and other state agencies have already opened investigations of politicians, writers, activists, and intellectuals accused of either sympathizing with or openly supporting enemies of the state. In particular, the focus appears to be on communist sympathizers and criminal elements. Many human rights activists are  expressing concern that this new crackdown on dissent marks a "White Terror" and will be used to crush any threat to the ruling party at the expense of individual or political rights."

 KMT_CULTS.0.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to legitimize the secret cults that flourish across rural China. These quasi-religious and cultural movements have existed for centuries. Many of the most powerful uprisings in Chinese history have occurred because of these cults. In recent decades, local self-defense forces have formed from these groups in the era of warlords and civil war. The Chinese government believes that by legitimizing these groups, it will bring these self-defense forces and stability provided by these groups in support of the state. However, there are fears that such groups may use this legitimization to expand their influence with the protection of the state."

 KMT_CULTS.1.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to crackdown and dismantle the secret cults and societies that flourish across rural China. While these groups have existed for centuries, in recent decades they began forming local self-defense forces amidst the general lawlessness from the era of warlords and civil war. By targeting these groups, the Chinese government will risk a law and order crisis until it can establish a presence in these areas. Others worry these cults may even turn into brigands and further erode law and order. Regardless, the move indicates a strong commitment by the Chinese state to assert its control over the country."

 KMT_SHOW_TRIALS.1.d:0 "A series of mass public trials are occurring across the Republic of China. Japanese Collaborationists from the Second Sino-Japanese War and communist activists accused of crimes during the civil war are being put in open court. The government is publicizing these trials across the country and early indications indicate the courts will convict all those charged. The government is eager to demonstrate the strength of the Republic of China and provide the Chinese people justice. Opponents to the government and international observers condemn the trials as purely for show and political theatre."

 KMT_LAND_REFORM.1.d:0 "In a surprise decision, the Republic of China passed a new, comprehensive Land Reform Law, meant to reducing the overwhelming power of landlords and provide opportunities to peasants. For decades, the ruling KMT established strong ties with rural landlords and for years its failure to support land reform proved advantageous to the communists. The government hopes its commitment to land reform will endear peasants to the state and cut the communists from a fertile pool of recruits for their insurgency operations."

 KMT_LAND_REFORM.2.d:0 "The Republic of China passed a new Land Reform Law, which the government claims mark a dramatic victory for the peasants of China. However, despite their claims of achieving a major reform, many local and international observers claim the reforms are minimal. Landlords retain many loopholes and peasants will not find dramatic changes to their situation. It appears the government is not willing to lose its traditional support from the landlords who provide economic and political support to the state."

 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.0.d:0 "The Republic of China announced it would lift Martial Law from the country. This is part of a major reform effort within the ruling KMT party. The reformers strongly believe the restoration of constitutional and democratic rights will weaken dissent and popular support to regional leaders or communist infiltrators. Similar reforms are likely to continue, despite criticism from some of the old guard in the party that such reforms and democratization could lead to a loss of control and dissent. The decision to lift Martial Law is being largely lauded across the country."

 CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.1.d:0 "The Republic of China passed legislation making the current Martial Law in the country permanent. This is a major victory for the KMT old guard which long argued against reformers advocating a restoration rights or democratic practices. They argue such reforms would make China weak and vulnerable to the threat of regional warlords and communist influence. The Chinese government believes continued Martial Law will keep the state strong, stop internal dissent, and help curb the influence of hostile ideologies or nations."

 TIBET_KMT.3.d:0 "The Republic of China strongly condemned the Dalai Lama for his naked usurpation of sovereignty from China. The Chinese government claims the Dalai Lama has illegally ceded territory and conducting foreign affairs without permission from China, who is the sovereign. The Chinese call on the Dalai Lama to cease his provocations and affirm his loyalty to China, noting that he should appreciate how much autonomy and respect he receives from the republic."

 TIBET_KMT.10.d:0 "In a surprise to many observers, the Republic of China signed an agreement with Tibet that recognizes its independence. The Chinese government stated its belief that the territory had been conquered by an oppressive Qing Empire and the new, democratic Chinese state could not hold on to a territory seized for the vanity of an emperor. The Tibetan government, led by the Dalai Lama, praised President [CHI.GetLeader] for his able leadership and promised a new era of peace between the two states. Many observers believe China is seeking to establish friendly ties with Tibet and keep it as a buffer state with South Asia."

 TIBET_KMT.5.d:0 "The leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, refused an ultimatum from the Republic of China to recognize the Chinese government as the sovereign of the country. The Chinese accuse the Dalai Lama of ceding territories and conducting affairs as a head of state and not as a subordinate to the Republic of China. The Chinese argue they are willing to give the Dalai Lama and Tibet wide autonomy, but in exchange, the Dalai Lama must stop conducting himself as an independent head of state. The Tibetan government refusal is a clear indication that the Dalai Lama is claiming complete independence from China."

 TIBET_KMT.6.d:0 "The Dalai Lama announced that Tibet is a sovereign part of the Republic of China and he is not a head of state. This marks an acceptance by the Dalai Lama of Chinese demands that he accept the sovereignty of the republic and halt any efforts to negotiate treaties or cede territories on his own authority. The Dalai Lama likely agreed after receiving assurances that the Chinese would provide Tibet immense autonomy and keep the current government to administer the territory for China. Some observers believe fears of a military intervention or Chinese-sponsored uprising were also factors pushing Tibet to accept the Chinese demands."

 TIBET_KMT.21.d:0 "The Dali Lama was overthrown in a recent coup organized by the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama, the spiritual number two of the Dalai Lama has for years harbored a desire for increased political influence. It appears armed troops loyal to him were able to secure key passes and towns, including the entrances to Lhasa. With the only recourse being a civil war, the Dalai Lama decided to instead order his loyalists to stand down. The new Tibetan government announced it will accept Chinese sovereignty on the condition Tibet retains its autonomy. Many international observers believe the Panchen Lama enjoyed the backing and even the arms of the Republic of China."

 TIBET_KMT.22.d:0 "An attempted coup to remove the Dali Lama in Tibet ended in failure. Fighters loyal to the Panchen Lama, spiritually second to the Dalai Lama, sought to seize control of strategic towns, passes, and entrances to Lhasa in order to force the rapid capitulation of the Dalai Lama. However, loyalists to the Dalai Lama thwarted the effort to capture areas around Lhasa and the Panchen Lama soon found his loyalists melt away once groups of pro-Dalai Lama fighters came to challenge them. In a statement the Dalai Lama claimed to have stopped a pro-Chinese attempt to seize power and pledged he would not compromise on the independence of his country. The Republic of China denied any involvement, although some photographs emerged showing the Panchen Lama fighters with Chinese rifles."

 TIBET_KMT.11.d:0 "A new agreement was reached between the Republic of China and India. Many of the previous disputes were removed following the Republic of China recognizing the independence of Tibet. Previously, China claimed sovereignty over Tibet and viewed itself as the sovereign to decide the border between India and Tibet. With Tibet recognized as independent, the Chinese border with India is much smaller and less in dispute. After brief negotiations the two sides were able to sign an agreement to formally settle their border. Both the Chinese and Indian government expressed hope that the new settlement will hopefully spur a renewed friendship between the largest democracies in Asia."

 CHI_SEATO.1.d:0 "The Republic of China agreed to join the Southeast Treaty Organization (SEATO) in order to expand its cooperation between member states and combat communist influence in the region. For the Chinese government, joining the group will expand its regional role and allow it access to local allies as it seeks to coordinate anti-communist activities in Asia. The Chinese government expressed its excitement at participating in the next SEATO Summit. The United States is especially happy for China to join as it gives the organization greater legitimacy. The Soviet Union and regional communist regimes are condemning the action and accuse SEATO of being an imperialist front. Opposition members have privately told the media their concerns that SEATO may offer little material benefits and make China a larger target for international communism."

 TIBET_KMT.15.d:0 "The Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibet, called on the international community to defend the country following reports that the Republic of China launched an invasion. Chinese troops are reportedly streaming into Tibet with the objective of establishing Chinese control. The Chinese government claims it is not launching an invasion but is instead doing a local action to restore control over a province. The Chinese argue the Dalai Lama is an autonomous administrator, but his recent claims to being independent and efforts to negotiate territory are clear violations and he must be brought to task. The Chinese insist all efforts at a peaceful resolution were rejected by the Dalai Lama and it hopes to swiftly restore law and order for the people of Tibet."

 TIBET_KMT.16.d:0 "Following the recent invasion of Tibet by the Republic of China, the traditional Tibetan aristocracy finds itself facing arrest or charges. This aristocracy has long been a major source of legitimacy, membership, and power for the Dalai Lama and his government. The Chinese decision to target this group and weaken them economically and militarily is to break the base of support for the old government. If the Dalai Lama and his allies lose bases of local support, this will strengthen efforts by the Chinese government to establish a more compliant Tibetan state. More importantly, Chinese officials brought to Tibet will also be protected from local competition. A number of Tibetan aristocrats are said to be fleeing in the direction of Nepal, India, and Burma."

 TIBET_KMT.105.d:0 "Following a series of political turmoil in Tibet, Tibet signed an agreement with the Republic of China. Tibet will be a part of China and be known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Chinese government promised to provide support for the Panchen Lama, including giving him extensive political power, in exchange for his government submitting to Chinese sovereignty. The Tibetan and Chinese government insist that the administration and governance of Tibet will remain largely the same, however, Tibet will no longer be able to conduct foreign policy or have complete control of its military forces."

 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.0.d:0 "As part of the recent political reforms and democratization in the Republic of China, President [CHI.GetLeader] signed a new law relinquishing a number of powers back to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan, once a rubber stamp for the ruling KMT has begun holding much more debates and passing laws without direction from the executive council. Observers believe the new reforms are turning the Legislative Yuan into a more potent political institution and check to executive power in the Republic of China."

 CC_CLIQUE_FALL.1.d:0 "The CC Clique faction within the KMT has seen a major drop in its influence and power within the Republic of China. Many of its prominent leaders are facing corruption charges or being removed from key posts. Media reports highlight some of the military and political failures of CC Clique leaders over the last few decades. The CC Clique represents the rightwing of the KMT and established a reputation for being virulently anti-communist, anti-Japanese. However, the new democratization reforms have opened positions to other groups and many reformers view the CC Clique as the old guard that must be replaced if China is to prosper.

 KMT_Atoms.1.d:0 "The Republic of China announced its full acceptance and support for the Atoms for Peace program initiated by the United States. Atoms for Peace is a program that encourages nations to learn about the risks and benefits of nuclear technology. The program provides support on education and technical assistance in developing nuclear reactors. The Chinese government believes the program will help it train nuclear scientists and develop its own nuclear technology to better reach its energy needs as it looks to a brighter future. Regional communist parties are criticizing the program as a covert means for China to acquire the means to produce nuclear weapons and accuse the United States of supporting the nuclearization of East Asia."

 KMT_Atoms.2.d:0 "Under a project started by the Republic of China which has been kept secret from the public for years now, was officially made public when the first Chinese Nuclear Test was a success under the codename of "Project Blue Sky White Sun". The Chinese population both living in China and living overseas have encouraged the Chinese Republic's acquirement of Nuclear Weapons, proud that their country could be seen as equal to the Western Powers and that the days of the Centuries of Humiliation are over for good. At the same time it has been condemned by many Western News Reporters who stated that the American Government who worked with the Republic of China in acquiring Nuclear Weapons, has only fed the Chinese lust for challenging the current World Order led by the United States and the Soviet Union, potentially forming their own World Order to challenge the Americans and Soviets. Nevertheless, Chinese Nationalism is at its peak everywhere, with the Chinese population celebrating their nation's marvelous achievement."

 KMT_Atoms.3.d:0 "News from the Gobi Desert of Alasha has reached us that our nuclear project under the name of Project Blue Sky White Sun has succeded. So far only both the United States and the Republic of China has any intel on this recent successful nuclear detonation test. Though, some officials have stated that this news should be revealed to the public and to the international stage, to garner regional influence and show the prowless and strength of our nation. This however, could backfire into backlashes of condemnations of our nuclear program."

After intense fighting, a ceasefire emerged, with Inner Mongolia re-establishing another Republic and the PRC setting up their government in the Beijing, its surrounding areas, and Manchuria. In the west, Sinkiang has joined East Turkestan. The rest of China, including most of its industrial base and ethnic Han population, is under the control of the Republic of China. The uneasy ceasefire is currently holding, but both sides are expected to rebuild their arsenals and plan for a future resolution of the conflict in their favor."

 ROC_CLIQUE.15.d:0 "Efforts of restoring internal stability and harmony in the Republic of China appear to be failing as several military cliques have risen up against the government. These military cliques are reminiscent to what was seen during the Warlord Period where military leaders formed loyal forces led by officiers who shared similar professional, cultural, or territorial backgrounds. Many in China claim a Second Warlord Period has begun and there are worries of potential civil war, political instability, or a breakdown in law and order. The Chinese government claims the situation will be handled swiftly and China would not be the victims of any warlords."

 ROC_CLIQUE.16.d:0 "Jiao Yulu, a former communist, has returned to his roots as a cult leader by proclaiming himself the heir to the Ming Empire. His claim is being backed by the popular Red Spear Society and other cults dedicated to the restoration of the Ming dynasty. The return of warlordism and rise in public distrust has seen a surge of popularity to such groups which organize local self-defense forces to combat warlords, bandits, and those deemed as corrupt government officials. The Ming pretender wants to overthrow the Republic of China to restore imperial rule, claiming the republic lacks the mandate of heaven and China needs a new dynasty. The Chinese government will have to restore public trust and respond swiftly before this monarchist movement becomes too powerful."

 ROC_CLIQUE.1.d:0 "Recent news suggest that the Hunan Clique has risen up against the Republic of China. These military officiers, citing oppressive government actions and interventions in local affairs, want greater autonomy and a reduction of centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Hunan to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Hunan officiers are known to have established ties with the communists during the 1920s and 1930s. There are fears from the Chinese government that the Hunan Clique may use those contacts and invite the communists for military help but end up handing the region over to the enemy."

 ROC_CLIQUE.2.d:0 "The Ningxia Ma Clique has risen against the republic. These military officiers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officiers in Ningxia to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China."

 ROC_CLIQUE.3.d:0 "The New Guangxi Clique has risen against the republic. One of the most powerful cliques during the 1920s and 1930s, its uprising is being viewed with great concern by the Chinese government. The Clique is rising up due to centralizing efforts and reforms targeting the cliques and old guard of the republic. The Chinese government accuses the rebelling officiers of acting out of self-interest and call on all loyal officiers to stay loyal to the republic. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Guangxi is a major population and economic base for China."

 ROC_CLIQUE.4.d:0 "The Qinghai Ma Clique of western China has risen up against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and the oppression of cultural rights along with autonomy as the primary cause of their unrest. The Chinese government called on all officers to remain loyal and condemned the clique for seeking to stop the development of China. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Qinghai is close to disputed borders and there are already concerns the rebel officers may seek to ally with either a foreign or domestic enemy of the republic."

 ROC_CLIQUE.5.d:0 "The Shanxi Clique has risen against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at breaking the current military organization as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal to the state. The Chinese government will seek to act fast in order to quell other uprisings and to bring order to Shanxi quickly. Shanxi sits close to the communists and there are fears local and foreign communist agitators may seek to use this conflict to expand their influence."

 ROC_CLIQUE.6.d:0 "The Xinjiang Clique has risen against the republic. These military officers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Xinjiang to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China. The clique is noted to have had close ties with the Soviets in the past."

 ROC_CLIQUE.7.d:0 "The Yunnan Clique has risen against the Republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at changing the current military structure of the country as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal. The Chinese government will seek to ask fast as Yunnan is strategically a vital province and has access to several foreign states who may seek to use the uprising to their advantage."

 ROC_CLIQUE.100.d:0 "The self-proclaimed Ming emperor of China, Jiao Yulu and his coalition of militias and cultists has brought the Second Warlord Period to an end. The charismatic former communist was able to tap into the anger and frustration of rural Chinese peasants who have grown fed up with the constant fighting between the Kuomintang, communists, and warlords. The return of the warlords was the last straw for many who feared their arrival would lead to more hardship and banditry. With Jiao Yulu victorious, the Republic of China appears on the verge of either joining forces and restoring the Ming dynasty or being destroyed."

 ROC_CLIQUE.101.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. Internationally, there are increasing calls and pressure for the government to initiate new policies to prevent such a situation from emerging again."

 ROC_CLIQUE.102.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) announced its forces had ended the Second Warlord Period. The PRC stated the corrupt and incompetent republic had led China to the point of disintegration and ruin. It then praised the peasants and people for rising up with the Peoples Liberation Army to sweep aside the corrupt warlords and incompetent republican provincial and national officials. The PRC concluded by announcing a program to provide development, prosperity, and modernization to the peasants who have been neglected and exploited for decades."

 ROC_CLIQUE.103.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare.

The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people.

 KMT_50s_Mainland.20.d:0 "If you go through the streets of Shanghai and reach out to the elderly residents, they will not tell you the story of a city, but that of a whole nation. Shanghai rose to become the economic center of trade and industrialisation of China, but at the cost of foreign powers holding great shares and rights within the city.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing, the city grew in numbers, eventually becoming the most populated place on the globe, with various groups of people seeking to start a new life there, including Jewish Refugees from Germany and White Russian emigres. The city emerged even further, electricity, radio and trams found their way into Chinese society via Shanghai, art innovations in music and animation started to blossom.\n\nPolitically wise, the city was in charge of the merchants which were heavily influenced by the underground gangs who entered an alliance with the Kuomintang in the 1920s. However, nobody could predict the horrors that were to come when the Japanese attacked the city. The first bombings of 1932 saw intense fighting between Chinese students and soldiers of the Japanese Concessions. Five years later and the Battle for the "Stalingrad of the East", as some western observers are calling it nowadays, saw various parts of the city destroyed, with casualties so high you could spend weeks counting the bodies (if most of them were not burned or disintegrated). With the Japanese surrender in 1945 and the dissolution of the Shanghai International Settlement in 1941, the city could take a breath from the horrors it had to endure until the next major event, maybe the most important one, struck. On July 13th 1949, peace finally returned to Shanghai for good, when the forces of the Republic were able to withstand the advancing People's Liberation Army against all odds and prevented Shanghai from falling into red hands.\n\nMaybe the time has come for Shanghai to heal its wounds now. All the corruption, the war, the foreigners and such influenced and traumatized the city to such a degree uncompareable to any other city in East-Asia. Maybe it is time for a new beginning."

One wishes to let the private schools stay as a form of appeasement to the Elites, while the other faction with a more hardline stance wishes to close down these private schools and establish only public schooling in the country, both to centralize the curriculum of schools and to regulate what's being thought.

The Communist Party of China has labelled these as 'fake western media claims' and that these landlords and businessmen are going through a period of rehabiliation.

After Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself Emperor of China, a national crisis erupted and numerous provinces declared their Independence from Beijing, beginning the era of Warlordism in China. The Kuomintang found itself in Guangdong from where it began to plan an expedition to unite the country. Sun-Yat-sen, the founder of the Party, died in 1925 and after a power struggle between Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-Shek, Chiang emerged triumphant and launched the Northern Expedition to unite the country under the KMT Banner. The following ten years went down in history as the Nanjing Decade, with the Kuomintang slowly trying to establish its rule over the country. Those years eventually came to an end, following the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident of 1937, escalating into a full blown war between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. After over eight years of tough resistance, the Republic emerged victorious and regained its former provinces of Manchuria and Taiwan from the Japanese.

The KMT follows the Three Principles of the People, which include Welfare, Democracy and Nationalism. After the rise of Yuan Shikai following the great revolution, the Kuomintang was banned but reorganised itself in Liangguang after the country split into various warlord regions. In order to unite the country, the KMT and the relatively small Communist Party of China formed the First United Front and defeated the Beiyang Cliques in the north, officially uniting China under the KMT Banner. However, various warlords were bribed and recruited by the KMT to maintain regional stability. Shortly after Dr. Suns death in 1925 and Chiang Kai-sheks consolidation of power, the CCP was purged from the KMT in 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Throughout the next decade until today, the KMT has been a shadow of its former self. Corruption, opportunism, factionalism and lack of popular support have brought the KMT into a terrible state.

 Intro.2.d:0 "When the Comintern supported the foundation of the Communist Party of China, it started as an unknown political organisation with only a few hundred members. The Comintern of the Central Committee of the CCP planned that the CCP will eventually join the Kuomintang in the First United Front against the imperialist Beiyang Cliques and will afterwards try to infiltrate the KMT and turn it into a truly marxist party. However, when Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and the Wang Jingwei faction of the Kuomintang was defeated by the Chiang Kai-shek faction, the United Front broke apart and the Communist members were purged during the Shanghai massacre 1927, officially starting the Chinese Civil War. Following the next ten years, the Kuomintang tried everything to eradicate the remaining Communist bandits who escaped to Shaanxi but following the Mukden Incident of 1931 and the Shanghai Incident of 1932, anti-Japanese sentiments within the KMT have drastically increased which lead to the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek by General Zhang Xueliang in 1936, who forced the Generalissimo to join yet another united Front with the CCP against Japanese Imperialism. With the war against Japan coming to an end in 1945, it did not take long for the conflict between KMT and CCP to re-ignite. As of 1946 the Civil War continues to rage on and the Communist bandits have exponentially gained popular support from the Chinese peasants. We need to put all of our efforts into defeating the red menace!"

 bss.2.t:0 "The Soviet Intervention"
 bss.2.d:0 "While we were on the verge of victory against the Communists, the Soviet Union intervened to prevent the total collapse of the CCP and invaded the regions of Xinjiang and Inner-Mongolia. The Communists still have control over Manchuria and the Beijing area, however we are not in a position to spark a conflict with the USSR.\n\nNevertheless we are in control of the Main-Han areas of China and secured the leadership of the KMT. As for now we need to focus on rebuilding the Country and getting our internal problems under control if we ever want to reclaim the North from the CCP."
 bss.2.a:0 "The guns rest...for now."

 bss.3.t:0 "The Republic on the World Stage"
 bss.3.d:0 "After the Civil War we found ourselves in a difficult position. We established ourselves as an Anti-Communist Stronghold in East-Asia but now after dealing with our internal problems we need to decide what role we will play in international politics, especially our relations with the United States and its allies in East-Asia."

 bss.4.t:0 "An Offer from the Chinese"
 bss.4.d:0 "A delegation from the Government in Nanjing arrived this morning in Washington. The Kuomintang seeks to deepen their ties with us and suggest that we receive a military base in the Taiwan Strait and are free to move our troops within the Chinese borders in exchange for advisors, equipment and protection against a possible communist aggression. This would increase our influence in China and East-Asia overall but given that a Soviet-backed CCP Invasion does not seems very unlikely it would mean that we would possibly get involved in a major regional war in East-Asia.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 bss.4.a:0 "Excellent! We accept the offer."
 bss.4.b:0 "This is too risky."

 bss.5.t:0 "Washington accepts!"

 bss.5.a:0 "Magnificent."

 bss.6.t:0 "The Americans refuse."
 bss.6.d:0 "The Americans refused our request for equipment and protection with their reasoning being that they do not want to be involved in a possible large scale war in China. However Washington continues to recognize us as the only legitimate government of China and is still open for trade and arms business."

 bss.7.d:0 "After a suprising turn of events, Chinese President [CHI.GetLeader] announced that he and his government are not willing to continue supporting the United States and expelled all American advisors from Chinese Soil as well as refusing to be part of SEATO.\nThe Chinese argued that the United States is just another Imperalist Power that wants to exploit China for money and saw it as necessary to expel American Influence in order to bring the Century of Humiliation one step closer to its end. Washington criticised those actions as foolish and immediately recalled all of its advisors and stopped its arms trade to China. Nevertheless this is a huge blow to American Influence in East-Asia but many experts in the west argue that the Nanjing Government is now exceedingly vulnerable to a possible Communist Invasion."

[CHI.GetLeader] claimed that SEATO can not stop the spread of Communism on its own and made clear that the Republic of China will provide support to any Nations in East-Asia that are under the threat of Communism.\nThe Soviet Union and other Communist governments in the region have criticised this move, declaring the alliance as useless and a threat to peace in the region. The United States of America however have already expressed their support for this idea and are interested in cooperation between SEATO and the Nanjing Pact."

 bss.9.t:0 "Remembering the May Fourth Movement"
 bss.9.d:0 "The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist, cultural, and political movement which grew out of student protests in Beijing on 4 May 1919. The first direct effect of the May Fourth Movement was to get the former Beiyang government to refuse to sign contracts that were unfavorable to China. The move shocked many western countries and made them realize that the weak China, which had only run away from it, had begun to stand up to it.\n\nNot only did it shape the Anti-Concessionist Movement in the country but it also re-ignited Chinese Nationalism and as of now we do again stand against the Imperalist in the West who are still trying to exploit our country for their own benefits. Famous scholar and Contemporary witness of the May Fourth Movement Hu Shih suggests that if we ever want to end the Century of Humiliation we need to remember and re-implement the thoughts and norms of the May Fourth Movement.\n\nMay China be free from foreign Imperalism. For ten thousand years!"

The chapter of the Chinese Civil war has been the longest conflict in the recent history, stretching from 1927 to [GetYear] where the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China were fighting over the control of the nation. Following the end of World War Two the Soviet Union intervened in the Civil War in favour of the Communists and secured them a political base in Manchuria. However the Kuomintang, which was in control over the majority of the country, has closed this chapter of Chinese history with their recent Invasion of Manchuria, marking the final battle between the two parties. The Kuomintang was victorious and today in a speech President [CHI.GetLeader] announced to the Chinese people that "the threat of Marxism is finally defeated" and that now "nothing stands in the way of prosperity for the Middle Kingdom".

Ever since becoming a part of the Qing Empire in the 18th Century, establishing peace and order in this region has always been a tough challenge for the Chinese Government due to local tensions between the various ethnic groups.\n\nThroughout the history of the Chinese Republic, the Province of Xinjiang went through tough times. It was plauged by internal threats, such as the Kumul Rebellion from 1931-1934, the Charkhlik Revolt of 1935 and the Islamic Rebellion of 1937 as well as external threats, especially from the Soviet Union, which has been trying to increase its Influence in the region ever since.\n\nAfter the Ili Rebellion, a Coalition was established between KMT Members, Uighurs and Pro-Soviet forces in the region but following our 'victory' in the Chinese Civil War against the Communist, the Soviet Union intervened in the region and supported the Turkestan Uprising in Ili which eventually seized control all over Xinjiang and established a pro-communist Regime.\n\nAs of now we need to decide how we approach this situation but at the same time we can't allow us to provoke the Soviet Union as we are in no position to risk a war with Moscow."

It allowed a small handful of upper citizens to rule over the majority of the population. Also known as the Gentry, it was an elite class in the Chinese Society which held important positions in the bureaucracy and the military and was responsible for the collection taxes and the administration of local armed forces in the various provinces.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1911 this concept kept living on on a more intense level during the Warlord area which saw various generals and military governors declaring their independence from the Central Government in Beijing, with their base of support being the local armed forces. The old principle of despotic hierarchy lived on and even kept itself alive during the years from 1927-1952 within the Kuomintang. Exploitation, bureaucratic capitalism, opportunism, money laundring, opium smuggle, it all contributed to the downfall of China in the modern age.\n\nLeaving 1000 year old values behind is not easy, but it is a necessary step to lead the country into the modern age.

The Union is not to be confused with the totalitarian "Labour Unions" of the despotic marxist countries in Europe and East-Asia which are being used to reeducate and brainwash the common people according to the governments policies. We aim to establish a union for the common man, who can finally raise his voice in his work environment and shall not be brutally exploited by his higher ups.

Many voices raised the concern of election rigging and corruption as well as repression of independent liberal parties. However what we could do is holding a nationwide vice presidential election. The position is relatively weak compared to the Presidential and Premier position but could still promise us some democratic legitimacy.\n\nFirst choice is the current Examination Yuan President and son of Dr.Sun, Sun Fo. He is also known for having an "iron neck" - meaning an outspoken liberal stance against Chiang Kai-sheks authoritarian measures. As a supporter of Constitutionalism and Chinese Nationalism, Sun Fo is advocating for reforms favouring constitutional institutions and the peaceful unification with the Communist Party. While this is totally unacceptable for our policies we can't purge him due to his status as son of the father of the Republic, which also gives him great popularity among the people.\n\nFavoured by Chiang Kai-shek and his allies, Chen Cheng is the other top choice. Chen was serving as a main commander in the NRA during the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Communist campaigns, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Civil War against the CCP. In the late phase of the civil war he was appointed Governor of Taiwan Province where he declared Martial law in order to establish a strong Nationalist stronghold on the island in case of a defeat of the Nationalist Army on the mainland. While being a staunch anti-communist and supporter of Chiang Kai-sheks policies, he is advocating for economic liberalisation and landreform in order to calm tensions between the peasants and the government, but also seeking for close cooperation with the United States as a bulwark against Socialism."

On the 12th of March 1925 not only did a whole nation lose its figurehead, but also a son lost his beloved father. But this visit is different, as Zhesheng is now standing here as the Vice President of the Republic of China, a unified China on paper but the goals of the Chinese Revoultion had still not been achieved to this day. In front of the marble sarcophagus he quietly starts to talk to his father promising him that he will do everything in his might to fulfill the dreams and ambitions of the Chinese Revoultion.

Following World War Two the NRA was reorganised into the Republic of China Armed Forces but even after the defeat of the CCP the army maintained a great authority within the country. Being trained after the Soviet model by Chiang Ching-Kuo it favours discipline, political obedience but is also a root for corruption and networks.

 bss.301.d:0 "Chairman! Our Spies that are tasked to infiltrate the Kuomintang government and their army have made a shocking discovery. The circle around traitor Chiang kai-shek has established plans for an Invasion of Manchuria and are now mobilising their armed forces to attack us! We need to take various measures to protect the Chinese people of Manchuria from western imperialism but many within the PLA Army staff don't think we can withstand an Invasion on our own for long. While the Soviet Union will definetly support us via weapon shipments, we should consider getting our other socialist comrades in Mongolia, Korea, Vietnam and Turkestan to help us and defeat the capitalists in East Asia once and for all."

 bss.302.t:0 "The Soviet Intervention"
 bss.302.d:0 "While we were on the verge of total defeat against the Kuomintang, the Soviet Union intervened to prevent the total collapse of our forces and invaded the regions of Xinjiang and Inner-Mongolia. The Bourgeoise are now in control over the main han areas of China, however we are not in a position to spark a conflict with the Kuomintang in the next years.\n\nNevertheless we are still in control of Beijing and Manchuria. As for now we need to focus on rebuilding the army and getting our internal problems under control if we ever want to reclaim China from the KMT."
