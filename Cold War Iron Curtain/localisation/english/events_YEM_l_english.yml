 #Yemen 1950s Events
 MagicCarpet.1.d:0 "Newspapers across the globe have released information regarding Operation Magic Capet which saw the successful evacuation of the Jewish community from Yemen to Israel. In 1949 the Imam of Yemen agreed to allow his Jewish community to leave, with the condition their property would be confiscated. With this approval, the Israeli, American, and British government dispatched transport planes to Aden. Over the next year, 49,000 Yemeni, 1,500 Aden, and 2,000 Saudi Jews were flown to Israel. This represented virtually the entire Jewish community of the region and marked a great achievement for the Israeli state as it rescued an at-risk Jewish community. Following the emergence of Israel in 1947, the Jewish community in Yemen suffered from communal riots and looting. In addition, the Imam of Yemen instituted a policy of heavy taxation and harsh economic policies towards the Jewish community. Many in Israel now believe it is the state's duty to protect all Jewish communities and offer refuge whenever it is needed."
 Yem.14.d:0 "The Imam of Yemen, Ahmed bin Yahya, has publicly designated his eldest son, Prince Muhammad al-Badr as Crown Prince. Imam Ahmed's decision has raised the anger of many in the government, especially among the Imam's brothers. They feel one of them deserves to inherit the title and that Prince al-Badr is too junior to be made crown prince. In addition, the young Prince al-Badr is seen as being highly sympathetic to Arab nationalist rhetoric and is expected to use his position to further Yemen's involvement in the Arab world. Traditionalist Yemeni officials and royals are said to be concerned by the Prince's views and hope he will understand Arab nationalism posses a risk to the monarchy and their centuries old standing as a political and religious institution. Prince al-Badr is said to believe his interest with Arab nationalists will ensure a brighter future for Yemen and he will be able to control such forces within the country."
 Yem.13.d:0 "Mohammad al-Badr today transitioned from crown prince to the Imam of Yemen following his successful coup against his father. The coup unfolded after Imam Ahmad bin Yahya, al-Badr's father, went to Italy to undergo several months of treatment. Rumors of his health fueled speculation and Prince al-Badr used his position as regent to institute radical reforms for the country, including the establishment of a parliamentary committee. Following the advice of Arab nationalist officers and officials, Prince al-Badr also invited Egyptian experts to modernize Yemeni state, military, and economic activities. Several major tribes revolted against this turn of events, leading to open conflict. The return of Imam Ahmad almost turned the tide against al-Badr but the young prince was able to hold on and defeated the tribes efforts to restore his father. With his rule now secured, Mohammad al-Badr finally coronated himself and traditional leadership in Yemen fears the revolutionary forces unleashed will soon engulf the entire nation. For Imam al-Badr, his reforms and assumption of leadership signifies Yemen's continued progress to modernization and a rebirth of the Yemenis people."
 Yem.10.d:0 "The Yemeni government announced it had abrogated the Treaty of Friendship and Trade it established with the Soviet Union. The original treaty established nascent trade links and mutual recognition of both countries but recent efforts at renewing the treaty and expanding diplomatic contacts are now ended. Many believe this decision marks a clear victory for the traditionalists and tribal elites in Yemen over reformists and Arab nationalist factions in government. The traditionalists believed increased exposure to leftist ideas and revolutionary ideologies threaten to transform and breakdown Yemeni society. However, this failure may spur the reformists to seek alternative methods of asserting their agenda, including through rebellion or public unrest. However, the Yemeni government is said to be confident such a result is highly unlikely and if any unrest occurs, the government will take care of the situation. Arab nationalist parties and states across the regions are said to be considering their options on how to aid their allies in Yemen."
 Yem.12.d:0 "Abdullah Yahya Hamid al-din, the brother of the recently deposed Imam, was officially coronated in Yemen. Imam Abdullah now sits in command of the Yemeni state with the support of the Army led by Lt. Colonel Ahmed al-Thalaya. The coup occurred following the decision of Ahmed bin Yahya, the former Imam, to appoint his son, Prince Muhammad al-Badr as crown prince. Leading liberals and moderate reformers approached Ahmed al-Thalaya to ensure al-Badr did not take the throne. Al-Thalaya and his cabal of supporters decided that Abdullah Yahya would be the best candidate to become Imam as he was more established and perceived as being less unpredictable as Prince al-Badr. On the day of the coup, al-Thalaya's troops surrounded the royal palace in Taiz, demanding Imam Ahmed relinquish his position to his brother. Imam Ahmed eventually agreed as a counter-attack failed to materialize. After his coronation, Imam Abdullah accepted the vows of loyalty from the leading tribal chieftains, although many still sympathize with his predecessor. In addition, there is a fear that Imam Abdullah will not be able to maintain authority over Lt. Colonel al-Thalaya and within the palace supporters of Prince al-Badr remain a potent threat. Imam Abdullah faces a difficult and delicate task in his efforts to restore stability over his realm."
 Yem.20.d:0 "Imam Ahmed bin Yahya declared his desire to continue his dynasty's quest for the establishment of a Greater Yemen. The vision is to the see the restoration of a Yemen encompassing the territories of the thirteenth century Rasulid state. Imam Ahmed's father consolidated quite a bit of land but was blocked by British Aden and the Aden Protectorate. In addition, Yemen's northern expansion was halted by the Saudi advances in the 1920s. Imam Ahmed has continued his father's ambitions and openly has called for Greater Yemen to be a mission for all Yemeni people. The British have grown increasingly concerned by the Imam's rhetoric as minor border skirmishes on the disputed Yemen-Aden border has appeared to have increased. These aspirations of a Greater Yemen have helped strengthened the Imam's political influence and role, but his actions have hurt ties with Britain and raised some alarms within the Yemen government that overzealous officers may seek to force a solution through arms."
 Aden.1.d:0 "In Aden today, masses of demonstrators have taken to the street to demand an end to British colonial rule in Yemen. Many believe the continued colonial occupation has delayed the inevitable unification of the Yemeni people. The British authorities remain firm in their stance and blame the unrest on provocations coming from neighboring Yemen and the rise of Arab nationalist feeling in the region. The British have had a presence in Aden and its surrounding areas since 1839. Aden offers the British a strategic presence in the region. London is currently divided into two camps. One argues that retaining its possessions in the region help solidify Britain's continued status as a global power and regional stakeholder. For them, the protests are confirmation that Britain must remain to prevent the region from falling to a hostile Yemeni state. However, the other camp sees the British presence as a drain on limited national resources and a stain on Britain's standing in the region. They will no doubt point to these protests as more evidence that the territory is untenable. Regardless, the protests emphasize the increasing unrest in the region."
 UAS.1.d:0 "In another major success for the movement of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism, Yemen has joined with the United Arab Republic (UAR) to form the United Arab States (UAS). Unlike the federation arrangement of the UAR between Egypt and Syria, the UAS is a confederation and Yemen shall retain its sovereignty. In recent years Yemen has sought Egyptian aid as a counter-weight to Saudi Arabia and to challenge the British in Aden. Within Yemen, young officers and officials welcomed the news as Yemen marching towards modernity. In addition, they feel Yemen now has a place in the wider-Arab world. More traditional leaders however feel uncomfortable as the revolutionary nature of the UAR runs counter to how leaders have run Yemen for centuries. More importantly they fear Egyptians and Syrians may soon flood in and destroy the Yemeni way of life. Within the UAR the news has been well-received but there are also concerns. Will Yemen accept eventual integration and can the UAR really support the amount of funds, equipment, and personnel required to develop Yemen. Instead of devoting such resources so far from the UAR, would that investment not be more effective at home. Despite these misgivings, the UAR and Yemeni leadership are adamant about how the UAS will be a beacon of development and growth for the Arab World."
 Yem.5.d:0 "Lt. Colonel Ahmed Yahya Al-Thalaya was among those senior Yemeni officials who saw the Imam's son, Prince Badr, as a risk to Yemen if he took the throne. Prince Badr was known to sympathize with radical Arab nationalists and many believed a brother of the Imam would have made a better heir. Al-Thalaya joined a cabal against the Imam and his heir. Al-Thalaya, a senior army commander, lead the coup to restore order in Yemen. Leading a group of like-minded officers and loyal troops, Al-Thalaya surrounded the royal palace in Taiz and once in control decided to not execute Imam Ahmed and instead demanded he abdicate in favor of his brother. The coup ultimately failed as loyalist tribes led by Prince Badr received word of the attempt and arrived to break it up. Once Imam Ahmed took control, he immediately ordered the execution of Al-Thalaya and the officers who supported him in Taiz. Lt. Colonel Al-Thalaya was said to have been defiant and unrepented of his actions upon the rapid completion of his trial and accepted his fate."
 Yem.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the failed coup against Imam Ahmed, the Yemeni ruler quickly executed the military officers and their leader in Taiz, where the coup attempt occurred. He decided to exile his two brothers, Prince Abdullah and Prince Abbas to Hajjah instead. The coup leaders had demanded Imam Ahmed abdicate in favor of one of these two brothers and it is clear both were involved in the plot. Although Prince Abdullah and Prince Abbas have had their statuses revoked and they are living in exile, Imam Ahmed decided to complete his purge. It was revealed that due to their role in the coup attempt, both former senior royal family members were executed in Hajjah. Considering the earlier executions in Taiz of the military officers involved in the coup, these latest executions mark the final reprisals of Imam Ahmed against his enemies. Many are saying the executions were carried out to secure the position of Prince Badr, Imam Ahmed's eldest son. Especially considering the princes had already lost their titles and were under close surveillance."
 Yem.15.d:0 "The 1959 revolt against Imam Ahmed ultimately failed as his son lacked the political skill and conviction to seize power from his father who was undergoing treatment in Italy. Rumors of his ill-health fueled Prince Badr's efforts at reforming the state along Arab nationalist lines and increasing unrest among the tribes. However, once Imam Ahmed returned he quickly reasserted control over the government and directed his loyalists to crush the tribes which had rose in revolt and seized territories without permission. Imam Ahmed's forces successfully restored order and have suppressed the uprisings around their main centers of revolt, Taiz and Sanaa. The tribes around Taiz were particularly hostile to Imam Ahmed during the revolt and as punishment he has decided to exile their leaders from Taiz. The punishment not only sets an example of what awaits enemies of the Iman, but it also keeps the royal palace in Taiz safe from future plots."
 Yem.16.d:0 "Amidst Prince Badr's regency, he sought to buy support for his Arab nationalist inspired reforms by offering tribal leaders' greater autonomy, arms, and cash. Prince Badr hoped calming the tribes would cripple the main means of armed force available to those who opposed his reforms. In addition, he sought to use some tribes to suppress his opponents. However, many of the tribes used this freedom to settle old scores and wreak havoc in areas across the country, turning public opinion against Prince Badr. Once Imam Ahmed returned to Yemen from Italy, the reforms were quickly halted and loyalists brutally restored order in Yemen. For the tribes which took cash from his son, Imam Ahmed has sent them empty bags to return the money and goods given. If the tribal leaders obey the Imam and return what they should never has accepted, they will be brought back to prominence, however, any tribal leader who fails, will face the Imam's wrath. Many are expected to comply with the demand, though several tribal leaders are said to have already refused and the Imam's expected repression will serve as an example of his continued absolute control over Yemen."
