 news_trieste.1.d:0 "Following a short campaign, the Italian military has successfully managed to seize control of the city of Trieste and the immediate surrounding areas. This comes after tensions over the city have flared since the conclusion of the Second World War. Following the conclusion of said war, the region was split off and put under United Nations jurisdiction via the Free Territory of Trieste. However, the region is noted for an ethnically divided population and being a major point of contention over ownership between Yugoslavia and Italy. As discussions on dissolving the Free Territory, tensions escalated into outright armed conflict between the two nations. To the surprise of the international community, Italian forces were capable of routing Yugoslav forces from both Zone A and Zone B of the territory and had announced their intentions to annex the entire area. The move has been widely condemned by Yugoslavia along with various communist nations."

 ITA_trieste_crisis_category_desc:0 "For the past few years, the city of Trieste and it's surrounding areas have been under occupation by Anglo-American forces; whilst the Yugoslav army occupies the southern part of the Free Territory. With Marshall Tito's pressuring the United Nations and the Allies to the Free Territory status of Trieste and annex it into Yugoslavia, we must do whatever we can to regain what has, and always will be, Italian land. Even if by force."

 ITA_trieste.6.d:0 "Excellent news has arrived from the general staff of the armed forces, our forces in Trieste have managed to secure the entirety of the Free Territory of Trieste. Per the reports, the Yugoslav army was ill prepared to face a major assault and was swiftly pushed out of the region. After pushing the Yugoslav forces out, our forces established fortifications on the border which were capable of rebuffing counter attacks by the Yugoslavian forces. This will surely help cement the current government’s legacy in attempting to salvage some of our losses from the prior war. More importantly, a failure here would surely have led to a collapse of the current government and major damage in the next elections. This said, the international response to this, especially from non-aligned and Soviet-bloc nations will surely be swift in their condemnation of our moves. Moving to ensure our NATO allies, especially the United States continues their close collaboration with our armed forces and equipment provisions will continue to be a necessity to preserve our gains."

 sieze_capodistria_desc:0 "Capodistria also known as Koper is the area located south of Trieste that is currently occupied by the Yugoslav army, while being formally in the free territory, it's by all means Yugoslav territory."


 Italy_Gladio_Coup.1.d:0 "In a series of shocking events in Italy, the commander of the Carabinieri, Giovanni de Lorenzo has seized control of the government. This follows an assassination of the late Prime Minister by communist sympathizers. In addition to the Carabinieri seizing key media and government institutions at the onset of the coup, the premises of the Italian Communist Party, Italian Socialist Party and Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity have been occupied and numerous arrests have been carried out based on local reporting. International response has been mixed at best, with the United States supporting the move as a necessary step towards restoring stability to Italy while others have criticized the move as violating democratic principles as well as the Soviet bloc condemning the newfound repression of pro-Soviet parties in Italy."
 Italy_Gladio_Coup.2.d:0 "Italy has experienced significant unrest in recent years with conflicts between neofascist, communist and government forces. However, the situation unexpectedly has reached new heights with militants from the National Front, National Vanguard  and dissidents within the army and security services launching a coup against the government. In the hours since the coup began, militants quickly were able to seize control of the interior ministry along with their stockpiles of heavy weaponry. Several government ministers, including the prime minister and head of national police have been executed and military units supporting the coup have sought to take over strongholds of the Italian Communist Party. With the coup seeming to have succeeded, the leader, Junio Valerio Borghese, a noted Italian war hero during World War II and hardline fascist has been declared the leader of the new government."

 ita_communist.1.d:0 "The results of the Italian national elections are out, and the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI) has won in a landslide victory. Led by Palmiro Togliatti, the party has managed to gain 335 seats out of 574, a landslide victory to the Christian Democratic Party and other opponents. The election, heavily influenced by external powers, with the USA backing the Christian Democrats and the Soviet Union backing the PCI, this has  shown the political might of the Soviet Union and no doubt, they have increased their sphere of influence. This election outcome was feared by the NATO members as it another nation has fallen to communism, just like the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Togliatti is yet to make an announcement on what stance the country will take next. Some speculate that the new regime might pull out of NATO and even join the Cominform, as Togliatti is a Stalinist. This is indeed a turning point for Europe and may very well be one for the world."
 ita_communist.2.d:0 "Today Palmiro Togliatti officially announced their withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Although [ITA.GetNameDef] was a founding member of the democratic defensive alliance, the recent election of a coalition dominated by the Partito Comunista Italiano into power has alienated the nation from their former allies. Though Palmiro Togliatti said nothing of the future of [ITA.GetNameDef], rumors are already emerging of communiques to [SOV.Capital.GetName], though they are as of yet unconfirmed."
 trieste_crisis.1.d:0 "After many years of reconstruction in both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Italy, the time has come for the matter concerning the Free Territory of Trieste to be laid to rest, once and for all. Having been divided  into two separate occupation zones; one of them, Zone A, to be patrolled by British and American Forces  along the metropolitan area of Trieste, and the other zone, Zone B, manned by Yugoslav partisans, controlling the rural countryside outside the city limits. Both the Italian and Yugoslav governments, with the aid of the United Nations, are hopeful to reach an accord regarding their continued policy towards Trieste."
 annex_trieste.1.d:0 "Efforts to arrive at a peaceful resolution to the Trieste Crisis came to a screeching halt today as the Italian Army crossed into the Yugoslavian Occupation Zone of Trieste to facilitate their forceful reintegration with the Italian State. After many days of hectic and tension-filled talks between the Adriatic nation states over the status of Trieste and it;s mixed Italian and Slavic population, the Italian government, following months of nationalistic rhetoric from Prime Minister Palla, ordered the Italian Army out of the metropolitan occupation zone and into the largely Slavic countryside, showing little regard for the overtures of Yugoslavian Premier Josip Broz Tito's clear plans of peaceful partition. The eyes of the world, once again, fall upon Belgrade in anticipation of the Federal Government's response to Italian Aggression in Trieste, and with the memories of both the first and second world wars fresh in the minds of both nations, many around the world fear that another violent chapter in the history of Mediterranean may be about to unfold once again."
 italy_resign.1.d:0 "After having only served six months in office, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Pella handed in his resignation today in the Italian capital of Rome. Having served as under former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi as Under Secretary of Finance in the second and third cabinets and Secretary of Finance under the fourth, he became the target of unrelenting scrutiny from communists and socialists for his attempts at westernizing the Italian post war economy. Following the failure of passing the Cheat Law, he was appointed Prime Minister of Italy wherein he was harshly criticized for his role in the recent tensions with Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia with regards to the Free Territories Trieste, the aftermath of which, many believe, to be the primary reason for his departure."

 ita.1.d:0 "The time has come for the city of Trieste, currently controlled by the UNSC, to be brought back to their respective leader. It is panned to split Trieste in Zone A, the main city and Zone B, the countryside outside of Trieste. Yugoslavia would get the countryside and we would get the city. Do we allow this split or do we want both parts?"

 ita.202.d:0 "San Marco 1 was launched on December 15, 1964 by an Italian ground crew using an American Scout rocket from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is the first Italian satellite and a great achievement for Edoardo Amaldi and his team. Because of their devotion and hard work, Italy became the fifth country to have its own artificial object in Earth's orbit. The main goal of the mission is to conduct ionospheric research. After 272 days of service, San Marco will burn while re-entering Earth's atmosphere."

########1950s event
ita_scomunica_commie.1.d:0 "In a significant and unprecedented move, Pope Pius XII has officially excommunicated all members of communist parties and anyone who supports communist ideologies. This decision, announced today, comes as a direct response to the growing influence of communism in Europe and its perceived threat to the Catholic Church and Christian values.The decree, issued by the Holy Office, states that Catholics who profess, defend, or promote the materialistic and anti-religious principles of communism are automatically excommunicated. The Church views communism as fundamentally incompatible with the teachings of Christianity, particularly concerning the nature of human dignity, the family, and the social order.The announcement has sent shockwaves through Catholic communities worldwide, especially in countries where communist parties have gained significant political power. This excommunication means that those affected are barred from receiving the sacraments, including the Eucharist and confession, and cannot hold any church office or role.The Vatican emphasized that the decision aims to protect the faithful from the dangers posed by communist ideology and to reaffirm the Church's commitment to promoting social justice through Christian teachings rather than through secular, materialistic ideologies."
ita_calabria_rain.1.d:0 "On 21 October 1953 a heavy flood hit central-southern Calabria, in the provinces of Catanzaro and Reggio Calabria, and unfortunately caused dozens of victims and very serious damage. It is one of the worst hydrogeological disasters since the post-war period. Hundreds of millimeters of rain fall in a few hours. In Badolato (Catanzaro) 362 mm were reached in a few hours, in Stilo 315 mm, while in Montebello Ionico over 290 mm. The torrents swell beyond belief within a few hours, causing exceptional floods. There are dozens of landslides, with interruption of communication arteries. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, including shacks built to accommodate those displaced by the 1951 f"On Wednesday 21 October 1953, Rai broadcast the second half of a national team training match live on television from the San Siro stadium in Milan with commentary from Nicolò Carosio and Carlo Bacarelli.It was the first time ever that Italian television proposed an event concerning the Italian national football team. And it was also Nicolò Carosio's first commentary. “A new sensation in our lives”, this is how the reporter remembered those moments in the column “At the Carosio microphone” on “Il Calcio e il Ciclismo Illustrato” where he also reported the words exchanged with his colleague Bacarelli: “We need to look at the television table , and then talk, as in any radio commentary, without too many details because everything can already be seen. It's better to add a lot of comments and name a few."The only visual testimony of that event is the photo published on Radiocorriere 52, programs on 27 December 1953."
ita_benevento_flood.1.d:0 "Last night a strong storm hit the Campania region, unleashing torrential and intense rain. The Calore Irpino river, which runs through the city of Benevento, swelled rapidly and broke its banks in several places, flooding numerous city neighborhoods.In the early hours of October 2, the situation became disastrous: the water flooded streets, houses and shops, reaching the second floors of buildings in some areas. The Vanvitelli Bridge, one of the symbols of the city, was completely destroyed by the fury of the river.Rescue operations began immediately, but conditions were extremely difficult: roads were impassable and many residents were stranded on rooftops. The Italian Army and the Red Cross mobilized to evacuate people and provide aid to the wounded.The flood caused extensive damage to Benevento: around 3,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed, over 10,000 people were evacuated and there were 20 deaths. The damages were estimated at approximately 3 billion lire. The Railway district was the hardest hit, with entire blocks completely submerged.Rebuilding the city will be a long process. The Italian government has allocated funds for repairs and the construction of new houses. The Vanvitelli Bridge will be rebuilt and is expected to reopen in 1951."
maxi_trial.1.d:0 "The so-called Maxi Trial, a criminal trial against the Sicilian Mafia began today in Palermo Sicily. Due to security concerns the trial is being held in a bunker-style courthouse specially constructed for this purpose inside the walls of the Ucciardone prison. Already violence against the judges is expected and concerns have been further raised about protecting judicial staff. The trial is being heralded as the most significant trial ever against the Sicilian Mafia and may perhaps become the largest trial in world history. This comes on the heels of the Second Mafia War which lasted until 1984 and resulted in thousands of deaths and the overall victory of the Corleonesi clan which had instigated the conflict to take over the overall Sicilian Mafia. Whether or not this trial will be able to finally stomp down the Cosa Nostra has yet to be determined, however past attempts have only ended in blood and failure."
