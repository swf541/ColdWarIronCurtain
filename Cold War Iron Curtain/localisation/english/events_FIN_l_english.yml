 fin.1.d:0 "For too long the workers at Kemi Oy Pajusaari have been striking. After Ministry of Social Affairs wage department wanted to lower the salary of the woodworkers by 30-40 percent, the workers decided to strike. Soon after the workers of Kemi Harbor and Kaarihaara Saw followed, including some local woodworkers resulting in thousands of workers striking. The situation started escalating when multiple parties attempted to end the strike in their favor. The struggle was mostly between Communist Party of Finland and the Prime Minister K-A Fagerholm's cabinet. The cabinet controlled a large part of the trade unions through the Social Democratic Party and the communists wanted to regain the power their parliamentary organization Finnish People's Democratic League had lost in the 1948 legislative election. Even the Soviets tried interfering, with the Soviet ambassador Grigori Savonenkov who voiced his support for the striking workers.\nAs the strikes went on, the government declared the strikes illegal. The strike caused a jam of 20,5 million cubic foot of logs to the mouth of Kemijoki river. The employers recruited strikebreakers, bringing them to work under police protection.\nAs the strikers went on a peaceful march of more the 3,000 strikers went on their way to the estuary, where the strikebreakers were driving logs and releasing the jam. As the march was stopped by armed policemen, a violent riot burst out. Protesters were equipped with sticks and rocks, while the police were using their batons and guns. One striker was shot and a female worker was fatally hit by a truck. It is still unclear who fired the deadly shot. According to official forensic examination the bullet was not shot from any of the police guns. One police officer stated he was prevented from shooting at a violent striker only by his gun jamming.\nAs a result, president Juho Kusti Paasikivi called a general alert of the armed forces and the government sent army troops to Kemi. This ended up with an arrest of 22 leading activists. A total number of 127 strikers were later accused of uprising, 63 of them were sent to prison. The police violence caused a series of sympathy strikes around Finland by communist dominated trade unions like the seamen's union led by Niilo Wälläri and a large number of metal workers.\nFinnish government was even afraid of communist uprising and Soviet intervention. Communists in turn, were accusing the government for violating the Paris Peace Treaty since they had sent military against the striking workers. The American press characterized the incident as a \"test for Finnish democracy\". Soviet newspaper Pravda was talking about \"police terror\" and "Prime Minister Fagerholm's collaboration with American imperialists". The sympathy strikes were finally put down several weeks later, as the Social Democrat controlled Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions expelled the striking unions. Several other unions decided to cancel their planned strikes. Some trade union leaders were later put on trial and given short sentences."

The job was given to a work group called Matematiikkakonekomitea, known in english as Mathematics Machine Committee lead by Erkki Laurila.\n\nThey started working on a first Finnish build computer based off a prototype German G1a computer. However the project faced many problems, including errors in the blueprints, inability to modify it due to it being a pre-made design and the fact that the G1a was already outdated. The computer, named ESKO, short for Elektroninen SarjaKOmputattori was eventually finished in 1960.\n\nThe first computer in Finland however was a IBM 650 nicknamed ENSI ordered by Postisäästöpankki in 1958."

 fin.4.d:0 "The Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine is a foreign policy doctrine established by President Juho Kusti Paasikivi and his close ally Urho Kekkonen, which aims to keep Finland an independent, sovereign, democratic, and capitalist country in the immediate proximity of the Soviet Union. This means using sometimes even radical measures to make sure the Soviets see Finland as a good neighbor.\n\nThe doctrine has received quite a bit of criticism though, ranging from the Soviets not seeing Finland as neutral, cooperation with Western intelligence agencies to some seeing the doctrine tending towards a \"liturgy\" of good relations."

 fin.5.d:0 "The Porkkala Naval Base is a Soviet held naval base in the Porkkala peninsula, compromising of the municipalities of Deferby, most of Kirkkonummi, Porkkalanniemi, Upinniemi and several small islands. The base is located only 30 kilometers (19 mi) west of Helsinki. According to the armistice of 1944, the area was leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years. On February 10, 1947, the Paris peace treaty reaffirmed the Soviet Union's right to occupy this area until 1994.\n\nDescribed by some as a dagger pointing at the Finnish capital, it would provide a remarkable advantage to the Soviets in case of a war. As a result, it would be in our best interests to drive the Soviets out of there.\nHowever, there have been rumors that they might be willing to return it back to us due to technological progress making coastal artillery obsolete, along with showing the west the peaceful relationship between our nations. Despite this, when our diplomat Eero A. Wuori asked the Soviet ambassador Viktor Lebedev about these rumors, he quickly dismissed them, stating \"Porkkala is essential to defense of Leningrad and harmless to Finland.\" This however hasn't stopped the rumors, and [FIN.GetLeader] has been advised to discuss this in the upcoming state visit."

After a brief talk about the global situation, the discussion moved towards the relations between us and Finland. Firstly it was decided that the agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (YYA) would be extended by 20 years. At some point the area of Porkkala became the subject of discussion. [FIN.GetLeader] mentioned about hearing rumors that we might be willing to return it early.\n\nIt's true that for a while now, [SOV.GetLeader], along with several generals have been considering the usefulness of the base. As technology has advanced significantly since we gained the base in 1944, the original benefit has been lost. Among other things, the base is very expensive to maintain due to its location and the need for extremely tight border security.\n\n[SOV.GetLeader] didn't deny these rumors, but wasn't willing to share the reasons due to state security. [FIN.GetLeader] then asked if we would be willing to start the negotiations about returning the base back to Finland."
 fin.6.tt:0 "This means you keep the base until the end of the lease (1994). Do note however, that it is very expensive to maintain due to its location and the need for extremely tight border security. As time passes, the costs will only increase. Along with this, the personnel stationed there tend to have very little interest in their duties, preferring to get drunk and cause trouble. Some might even try to defect to Finland.\nIf that's not enough, we miss a great diplomatic opportunity to show the West our willingness to peace with our neutral neighbor. The Finnish government is unlikely to object our decision, but the Finnish people will be sour. [SOV.GetLeader], we won't stop you from doing this but please remember, we warned you.\n"
 fin.7.d:0 "On[GetDateText], the people of Finland were shocked by the news of the death of Marshal Carl Gustaf Mannerheim the night before in Switzerland. The departure of the Marshal was expected both in the close circle and among the Finnish people.\nFew days earlier, Mannerheim had fallen ill and had an emergency abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful, however his heart could no longer withstand the strains of the previous illnesses. He understood that the end was near, said goodbye to those present, and thanked them for all that they had done for him. Shortly after, he fell unconscious and died four hours later.\nAt the Canton Hospital, the body of the Marshal rested on a podium in the middle of the chapel, covered with the Finnish flag and surrounded by flowers. Around him stood Swiss police officers in the guard of honor. The next day, president [FIN.GetLeader] spoke solemnly beautifully on the radio about Mannerheim's memory and life's work. The government appointed a commission to prepare the state funeral. It was decided that the funeral would be held 2 weeks later."

This will however take several months as the soviets prepare to leave the area by destroying the military installations and moving their troops away. We meanwhile have to ratify the agreement in the parliament and prepare to return the land to their rightful owners. Soon after his arrival, president [FIN.GetLeader] gave a radio speech, stating "For the first time, I've returned from the Soviet union satisfied. The pen has fixed what the sword has broken.\"\n\nAnother topic of the meeting was the agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (YYA), which was renewed for another 20 years."

While [SOV.GetLeader] confirmed it was considered, it was ultimately decided that the area is still useful to them. Besides that, the meeting was described as good.\n\nAnother topic was the agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (YYA). It was extended by another 20 years unchanged, despite some objection to it."

 fin.10.d:0 "After months of preparations from both us and the Soviets, the area of Porkkala finally returns to our control after being controlled by the Soviets since 1944. The last of the Soviet soldiers have left the area and agreement of the return was signed in Soviet embassy in Helsinki.\nSoon after this, the border gates opened in Espoonlahti bridge and Finnish soldiers marched to the area. The Soviets organized a tour of the area to Finnish and foreign journalists.\n\nThe press describes the event as \"A Victory for the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine.\" Some are even thinking this as a possibility for return of Karelia. The return however has also gathered some criticism, with some criticizing Kekkonen for taking too much credit for the event. Minister Aarre Simonen downplayed the event due to the fact that the deal didn't include Karelia. President [FIN.GetLeader] scolded him harshly, ending his rant stating \"Maybe Mr. Simonen goes to Moscow himself and brings an American soldier with him.\"\n\nAs the Soviets didn't have much use for the base towards the end, many of the remaining buildings showed signs of neglect. Even worse, many graveyards had been destroyed and graves vandalized. While this was disregarded as a work of only a few drunk soldiers, they have already agreed to repair the damages and pay abundant compensations for it."

The reasons stated for the occupation of Porkkala related to the defense of Soviet sea lanes in the Gulf of Finland and the protection of Leningrad. However, Porkkala also functioned as an army base which had a role in projected Soviet land operations.\n\nWhile the Finnish people celebrate the return, many western nations labeled it as nothing more than a cheap priced propaganda trick."

The Social Democrats involved in the government did not approve of the program, and as a result, the Kekkonen III Cabinet collapsed and was replaced by the Kekkonen IV Cabinet, which was made up of bourgeois parties and was a minority government.\nIn the autumn of 1953 the Kekkonen IV Cabinet drafted a proposal for the state budget called \"Niukkis-budjetti\" (the Stingy Budget), which would have significantly reduced social expenditure, including statutory expenditure, in accordance with the K-program proposals. However, in October 1953, Kekkonen's Board of Directors announced that it was ready to abandon the K-program.\n\nNow, the issue has once again been brought up. After the recent parlamentary elections, it has been very hard to form a government. Now, the SAK and SDP have announced that they will support Kekkonen V Cabinet if they agree to cancel the K Program forever and replace it with a new S Program.

 fin.40.d:0 "On January 3, 1961, an Aero Oy DC-3 passenger plane on its way from Kokkola to Vaasa crashed into the ground in the area of Koivulahti in Mustasaari. 22 passengers and a crew of three were killed in the crash.\n\nThe aircraft was scheduled for take-off from Kronoby Airport at 07:00, but take-off preparations were late and the plane departed at 07:16. The pilots did not follow the minimum flight altitude for the Kronoby-Vaasa route, which was 1,500 feet, instead flying below 330 feet. Shortly after the flight's last radio contact with the air traffic control the plane turned abruptly to the left. This slowed the plane and disrupted air flow significantly. The pilots tried to correct the situation by applying full throttle, but this did not help and the plane went into a spin. The last thing seen by eyewitnesses on the ground was that the pilots had turned the landing lights on before the plane crashed into the woods at 07:40:30 in a steep 70-degree turn.\nFirst responders, reaching the crash site ten minutes after the crash, were unable to rescue anyone due to intense flames which reached over 15 metres (49 ft) in height. The aircraft was extensively destroyed by impact forces and the fire.\n\nOfficials from Finland's Accident Investigation Board concluded that OH-LCC had been airworthy. No evidence was found of any technical malfunction, of the plane hitting trees, or of an explosion. According to the report, neither the pilot, Captain Lars Hattinen, nor the co-pilot, First Officer Veikko Halme, were in a fit state to fly. They had not slept well the previous night and had been drinking heavily. Autopsies revealed that Hattinen had a blood alcohol content of 0.20 (2 ‰), while Halme had 0.156 (1.56 ‰). In all, Hattinen, Halme, and the possible cockpit visitor had drunk sixteen bottles of beer, seven gin grogs and 900 grams of cognac from 21:50 to 02:00. Hattinen had thus neglected his responsibility for the plane's and passengers' safety, and neither he nor Halme were in any condition to pilot the plane on the day of the accident.\n\nThe probable cause of the accident was determined to be pilot error when making a left turn. It is possible that one passenger might have been present in the cockpit based on his body location."

It is a research reactor located in the Otaniemi campus area in the city of Espoo. The TRIGA Mark II reactor has a thermal power of 250 kilowatts. In addition to research, the reactor is used for production of radioactive isotopes for industrial measurements. It is also used for neutron activation analysis of geological and biological materials.\n\nA contract for buying the research reactor was signed in 1960. The most active people behind the acquisition were Pekka Jauho, Erkki Laurila, and Heikki Lehtonen. The research reactor project is preparation for constructing a nuclear power plant in Finland. A research reactor is needed for training of personnel for the power reactors.\nFiR 1 started operation in 1962 at 13.44 when president [ROOT.GetLeader] started the reactor."
 fin.42.t:0 "Corruption Scandals"
 fin.42.d:0 "Two major corruption scandals have emerged. Social Insurance Institution of Finland Affair and the Midwifery School Affair.\nThe Social Insurance Institution case is a case that came to light in 1961 concerning the legality of the housing arrangements built by the Social Insurance Institution for its staff. Members of the Board of the National Insurance Institution were convicted of misconduct in office. The charges were more serious, as they concerned offences of misconduct in public office. The charges and conviction related to the financing of housing for the institution's staff. The matter came to public attention when, in the autumn of 1957, MPs Veikko Vennamo and Arne Öhman called on Chancellor of Justice Olavi Honka to investigate the legality of the arrangements for the housing built by the Social Insurance Institution for its staff. The Kela board assisted the projects by granting loans on favourable terms and the entire Kela board was prosecuted for misconduct and maladministration. On 28 June 1961, the Helsinki Court of Appeal sentenced all members of the Board of the Social Insurance Institution to be dismissed from their posts.\n\nThe midwifery school affair was a political scandal in Finland at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s. The problems began when the college's building committee, headed by Finance Minister Aarre Simonen, chose the already bankrupt Rakennusliike Teora as the contractor in December 1956. The construction company's difficulties were hidden behind a plan to pay tax arrears and it was paid in advance for 200 million Markkas for work still to be done, to avoid the company being put on the protest list. At the same time, Teora was building apartments in Munkkivuori at a bargain price for members of the Midwifery College building committee, including Minister of Finance Simonen. The construction company Teora also pledged the share certificates of these apartments as collateral for its debts and for the construction of the Midwifery College. When Teora finally went bankrupt, however, Minister Simonen had managed to arrange for his own housing company to be released from these securities.\nThe bankruptcy of the construction company Teora ultimately cost taxpayers around 300 million Markkas. After Teora's bankruptcy, the new building of the Midwifery College was completed by the construction company Puolimatka Oy, and the building was opened on 11 April 1960. On 5 April 1961, the Court of Appeal began hearing the case. The trial was given a further boost when Reino Kuuskoski, a member of the Court of Appeal and President of the Supreme Administrative Court, was suspended from office in the summer of 1961 for the so-called People's Pension Fund housing case, while the Midwifery College case was pending. On 14 December 1961, the Court of Appeal sentenced Aarre Simonen and Vilho Väyrynen to fines of 375,000 and 80,000 marks, respectively, under the Ministerial Liability Act."

When this amendment to the law was debated in Parliament, no one called for the retention of the death penalty in peacetime.\nToday, the death penalty has been abolished apart from treason against state. The government's proposal referred to the fact that public opinion had changed, and that death penalty should only be applied in high treason against the Finnish state. However, when the bill was debated in Parliament, some members of the SMP and the Coalition Party opposed the complete abolition of the death penalty and managed to keep it for treason."

When this amendment to the law was debated in Parliament, no one called for the retention of the death penalty in peacetime.\nToday, the death penalty has been abolished from the penal system altogether. The government's proposal referred to the fact that public opinion, during the more than 20 years of the law prohibiting the death penalty in peacetime, had become increasingly opposed to the use of the death penalty in any circumstances.  However, when the bill was debated in Parliament, some members of the SMP and the Coalition Party opposed the complete abolition of the wartime death penalty because it still existed in Sweden. However, the counter-motion (by Veikko Vennamo) was defeated by 140 votes to 29, with 27 abstentions and three voting empty. In the debate on the issue, Coalition Party MP Eero Lattula invoked not only the example of neighbouring countries, but also the deterrent effect of the death penalty, which, in his view, would make those planning to commit acts of cowardice and desertion, for example, seriously consider the consequences of their actions. On the other hand, Lattula's party colleague Juha Vikatmaa argued that negative measures such as the death penalty would not be able to maintain the capacity of the defence forces and the citizens' will to defend their country. SKDL MP Anna-Liisa Jokinen, on the other hand, believes that Finland could well lead the way in banning the death penalty."

 fin.46.d:0 "In a speech at the Celebrations in Ostrobotnia house to mark the 50th anniversary of Finland's independence, Kekkonen said that an important task of the 1960s is to integrate communists into a functioning part of society. He combined his great idea of national unity with international peaceful coexistence. The struggle of ideas based on brute force and violence had to be transformed into an economic and intellectual competition. \"He who has confidence in the viability and vitality of his own cause will dare to enter it.\"\n\nHe said in Ostrobotnia that Finland was as dear to the Communists as it was to other Finns. \"The Finnish people would be weak if every fourth citizen were an enemy of the fatherland.\" Kekkonen's opening to the far left was a bold move. The agonising revolutionaries trained in Moscow had only retired from the SKP in early 1966 and the toughest of the old, Ville Pessi, was still party secretary. To the outside world, it was still hardly apparent that the SKP had begun to develop in the direction of Eurocommunism."

The police interrupted the dancing, for which the Provincial Government had not given permission. The Renegades were also prevented from performing.\nThese led to an incident in which the windows of the dance hall were smashed, police cars were destroyed, and stones and bottles were thrown at the officers. Eventually the riot spread to the centre of Korso. The fire brigade was called in and tried to calm the situation with water cannons. However, the youths' rage did not subside and fire engines were overturned. The rioting youth was eventually subdued with tear gas. Twenty youngsters were arrested, and on the TV news, police chief Edward Urja threatened them with custodial sentences. There were also smaller riots in a few other places.\nInterior Minister Niilo Ryhtä urged parents to monitor their children's movements more closely. A working group set up at short notice suggested restricting the work permits of foreign orchestras, which seemed to "set minds on edge\". Mr. Ryhtä also felt that young people had too much free time and dreaded the forthcoming move to a five-day working week.

Prime minister [FIN.GetLeader], fearing civil war, deccided to resign and dissolve the government.

For that spot there are two choices: eurocommunist Aarne Saarinen or traditional opposition leader Taisto Sinisalo.\n\nAarne Saarinen has fought disputes between the majority and minority of the SKP. Saarinen tries to keep his party separate from the Soviet NKP and to promote independent, national and peaceful communism. The Warsaw Pact's invasion of Czechoslovakia was condemned by him and the majority of the party.\n\nTaisto Sinisalo is the leader of the partys hardline pro-Soviet faction (also known as taistolaiset after Sinisalo's first name) and vice chairman of the party.

Finnish President Urho Kekkonen's letter Find Finland – Löydä Suomi, published in 1966, foresaw future Nordic developments, stating that Sweden, Finland and possibly the whole of the Nordic region could in time be developed into a single economic and cultural area.\nThe initiative for a common Nordic economic area was taken by Danish Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard at the Nordic Council meeting in Copenhagen in spring 1968.\n\nBy July 1969, negotiations had reached agreement on most aspects of the draft agreement, including capital movements, trade and maritime policy, labour and social policy, education, research and development aid. However, the areas of industrial products, agriculture and fisheries, and the financing of cooperation were still outstanding.\nThe visit of Finnish President Urho Kekkonen to Zavidovo, as a guest of the Soviet leadership, was significant for the fate of Nordek. During the discussions in Zavidovo it became clear that the Soviet Union was opposed to Finland's accession to Nordek. [SOV.GetLeader], General Secretary of the CPSU, bluntly described Nordek as an \"anti-Soviet grouping\" whose activities would damage relations between Finland and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe final nail to coffin came at the Nordic Council meeting in Reykjavík in the spring of 1970, when Finland announced that it would not sign the Nordek agreement. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto, who had been a keen advocate of Nordek, felt the project's failure to be a personal disappointment. Similarly, Swedish Prime Minister [SWE.GetLeader] repeatedly regretted the collapse of Nordek afterwards. On the other hand, Denmark's accession to the EEC, which took place at the beginning of 1973, would have meant that Nordek might have been dissolved as soon as it was born."

 fin.55.d:0 "Tragedy has hit Finland lately, when peaceful student protests were violently suppressed by police, which lead to the protesters responding in kind. It all started when a large group of students from the University of Helsinki occupied the Old Student House. The house was the designated location of the festivities for the Student Union's centennial celebration, scheduled the day after. The action was in protest at what they saw as 1950s style "white tie party" and an uprising against the values which this stood for. The action has been seen as being inspired by various political movements across Europe during or before the same year.\nThe dissidents' main demands concerned democratic reforms to the university's administration. However, some of the participants also demanded the founding of Marxist-Leninist study-circles in the departments and faculties, abolishing compulsory membership of the Student Union and changing the political alignment of the monthly student magazine Ylioppilaslehti. Banners carrying these proclamations were hung from the Student House's balcony and speeches were made. However, not all of the youth involved were communists; people aligned with the centrist-agrarian Centre Party participated as well.\n\nThe government feared that if they gave in to their demands that'd allow the USSR to influence their students and future generations and through them, their entire country. While there were disagreements amidst members of the government and parliament, the order to quell the protests by any means necessary was already given. Police officers marched en masse to the Student House and the university and while they faced some initial resistance, they caught the students by surprise. Seeing such a response, many students decided to make a stand and started fights with the police, using anything they could find as a weapon. It's unknown if there have been any deaths yet but several people and police officers have suffered injuries of various degrees while the government's popularity has plummeted, with the protests are escalating into full blown riots.\nWhere this will lead remains to be seen, but rumours and unofficial commentary coming from anonymous government sources say that if a solution isn't found soon, current President Rafael Paasio might be forced to resign."

In her written question to the government, Aili Laitinen, a doctor and parliament member, inquired: "What measures does the government intend to take to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and professional prostitution and does the government intend to take steps to create a state brothel system that would serve both male and female customers in safe conditions or does the government intend to take urgent measures to provide factual and effective sex education and for inculcating healthy attitudes in all educational institutions and state media to prevent the harm caused by loose venereal diseases?"\nOsmo Kaipainen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health, attempted to answer Laitinen's question and in his opinion the state brothel system would have been a bad solution, which would have created new problems rather than solving the old ones. With brothels being abolished in Finland since the 19th century, he was quoted as saying that "there was no reason to go back to the last century to solve today's problems". Personally, Kaipainen said that he believed in state-led entrepreneurship, but didn't believe that such a business would have been very close to the heart of the government. Instead, Kaipainen said the government prefers effective gender education.\nAfter much heated debate, the government and parliament decided to carry a motion forward on the creation of state brothels, which will be carefully monitored so that no health violations or anything else illegal occurs. The side which supports this motion has argued that the brothels will provide a safe place for customers and employees, while also providing the state with funds that it will need."
