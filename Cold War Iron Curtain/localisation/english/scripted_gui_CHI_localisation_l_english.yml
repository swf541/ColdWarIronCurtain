The Kuomintang government, favoring policies of centralization and sinicization, has already taken various measures to align the Taiwanese province into the Chinese state. Taiwanese schools now emphasize Chinese language, history and a curriculum supporting the ideology of the Kuomintang. However, considering that the majority of the Taiwanese people have been disconnected from Chinas influence for over five decades, it is clear that they are not willing to adopt every doctrine laid out by a mainlander-dominated government.\n\n§RIf this modifier falls below -30% Stability and War Support the Kuomintang government will fall and the Republic of China will cease to exist.§! §!"

But following the defeat of the Beiyang clique, the party only focused on maintaining and expanding its power and fighting the Communist Party. Inefficient bureaucrats, corruption, factionalism and opportunism contributed to the downfall of the Kuomintang and its defeat against the Communist Party on the mainland.

The Premier has the duty of the representation of administrative policies and has to report proposed legislation to the Legislative Yuan. The Premier may serve as the Vice President, should the current Vice President take office as the President until the rest of the original presidential term is served. The Premier has to resign from office if a motion of no-confidence is initiated by the Legislative Yuan and approved with a simple majority. Given the enormous influence of Chiang Kai-shek's presidential position, it is unlikely that the Premier will hold any significant powers in the government as of now."

If the Vice President assumes the presidency in case of the death, illness or resignation of the current President, the head of the Executive Yuan and Prime Minister of the Republic of China will fill the role of Vice President.

In 1924, Li became the leading figure of the New Guangxi clique and assisted the KMT during the Northern expedition. However, this alliance was short lived as he was expelled from the KMT and fought against Chiang Kai-shek in the Central Plains War of 1930.\n\nHe eventually reunited with the KMT in order to repeal the Japanese invasion, but continued to oppose and criticize Chiang Kai-shek. In January 1949, after Chiang Kai-Shek resigned as the president, Li Zongren became the acting president of China, however he never held any significant power and was removed from office after Chiang Kai-shek resumed his duties following the KMT Victory in the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gThe New Guangxi clique, led by Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi, is one of the most influential warlord cliques in China and has always had a rocky relationship with the central government in Nanjing. Chiang Kai-Shek attempted numerous times to reorganize the warlord armies of Guangxi, which ultimately caused the Guangxi Clique to break off relations with the central government which started the confrontation that lead to the Central Plains War. From 1930 to 1936, the Clique organized the reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a "model" province with a progressive administration. As a result, Guangxi was able to supply large numbers of troops in the war effort against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, giving it great status among the Southern Chinese Provinces.§!"

Over time the Kuomintang secured their authority in the provinces of Central China. The government in Nanjing is the dominant political institution in those provinces and has effectively sidelined any other political rivials, whether they are former local warlords or opposed political cliques.

Following the coup against Tang Jiyao resulting in Tang abdicating the title of Governor and died a few months later, a civil war in Yunnan broke out between Long Yun and other factions. During the Yunnan civil war, Sun Du decided to take a neutral stance and waited the war out, although he did have sympathies towards Long Yun. When the Yunnan civil war resulted in Long Yun's victory, Sun was made Long Yun's Right Hand Man. Under Long, Sun took an anti-communist approach and lead his armies against the escaping Communist forces during the Long March which gave the General praise in the Clique. During the War with Japan, Sun led his troops to Jiangxi Province to fight the Japanese army. At the late stages of the war with Japan, Sun broke away from Long Yun who was later replaced by Lu Han and joined Chiang Kai-shek's forces.

During the Japanese occupation, the Shanxi clique was heavily weakened resulting in the brief Communist occupation from 1946 until 1949. With the Kuomintang back in power it is safe to assume that Nanjing is seeking to integrate the former autonomous clique into the Republic properly.§!"
 POLITICS_MA_BUFANG_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gMa Bufang was born in 1903 in Gansu as the son of Ma Qi, founder of the Muslim Ningxia Army of Qinghai in the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution. Ma sided with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang after the succesful Northern Expedition. Ma's fierce anti-communist stance and loyalty to the Kuomintang have been proven multiple times, as shown in his military operations against the Communists in the early 1930s and the refusal of multiple Japanese defection offers. His unconditional loyalty to the Kuomintang, despite being Hui, has made him one of Chiang Kai-sheks personal trustworthies. In 1945, Bufang was appointed to the central committee of the Kuomintang party, and he successfully fought against revolting Uyghurs in addition to fighting the Communist Party of China during the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gThe Ma Families have been ruling Northwestern China ever since the abolition of the Qing Dynasty. There are three families in the Ma Clique, controlling the Gansu, Qinhai, and Ningxia provinces. After the Northern Expedition, the Ma warlords joined the Kuomintang and assisted the Nationalist government in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Wuyuan. The most prominent members of the families include Ma Bufang, the current representative of the Ma Clique, cavalry general Ma Hongkui, Ma Buqing, Ma Hushan and Ma Hongbin. Past attempts to destabilize the region by Chiang Kai-Shek have failed and the relative absence of Japanese and Communist troops in the Northwest has allowed the region to keep its autonomy from Nanjing.§!" 
 POLITICS_SUN_ZHEN_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gNear the end of the Second World War, Sun Zhen was appointed to the Zhengzhou province, and hold his position there until February of 1948. He was redirected to the Xuzhou province as a bandit suppression officer before he was moved once again in October of 1948, when he was transferred to the Sichuan-Hubei border area, and kept his career of pacification officer. After February 1949, Sun was appointed deputy commanding officer of the Chongqing pacification HQ and commanding officer of Chuandong pacification HQ. After the fall of Liu Wenhui, he was picked by the Generalissimo as military governor of Sichuan.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the region of Sichuan turned into contested territory, with numerous warlords fighting for control over the province for decades. The Sichuan Clique was divided into smaller warlord groups, or Defense Zones, separated from each other with distinct military, political, and economic boundaries. In 1935, Liu Xiang consolidated his rule in Chongqing but eventually died only 3 years later. This opened the door for the Central Government, who was relocated to Chongqing at that point, to further integrate the province into the Republic. However, the end of the Anti-Japanese War and the resumption of the Chinese Civil War caused successor Liu Wenhui to regain a certain degree of autonomy, which is still being upheld in Sichuan, even after Liu Wenhuis arrest.§!"

He has shown great success in defeating the retreating Red Army units of He Long and Ye Ting, occupying the territories the communists had previous controlled. By the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li had been promoted to colonel. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Li Mi was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general thanks to his successful campaigns against the Japanese in Central China and Western Yunnan. He barely escaped certain death when PLA troops were about to incircle his units in Henan and was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to defend Yunnan Province in early 1949. After the war, he entered local politics in Yunnan and eventually rose to prominence due to his good relationship with the Generalissimo and the downfall of former governor Sun Du.§!"

After the war, he joined the Kuomintang and became a close ally of Chiang Kai-shek. Zhao re-entered local politics once more in Hunan.

 POLITICS_WANG_MING_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gWang Ming was among the 28 Bolsheviks who were sent to China by the Comintern to take over the leadership of the Communist Party of China in 1929. However, they met strong resistance within the CPC from members such as Zhang Guotao and Zhou Enlai. Not surprisingly, they were assigned insignificant positions. During the 1930s, he became one of Mao Zedongs main political rivals within the CPC, embracing traditional marxist-leninist ideology in contrast to the beliefs of Mao. In 1937, he persuaded Mao to ally with Chiang Kai-shek in the face of Japanese aggression. During the war he continued to criticise Maos policy towards Japand and the Kuomintang. Despite growing illness, Wang continued to be Maos greatest critic and favourite candidate of Moscow, which ultimately enabled him to topple Mao as chairman of the CPC after the disasterous defeat in the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter 14 Years of Japanese occcupation, Manchuria finally returned to China.

After the victory of the Red Army in the Russian Civil war and the death of Bogd Khaan, the Mongolian People's Republic was established. Mongolia underwent collectivization of livestock, destruction of the Buddhist monasteries and Stalinist purges under the leadership of Khorloogiin Choibalsan. In order to secure Soviet assistance in the Pacific War, the Western Allies granted that after the war Outer Mongolia would retain its independence at the Yalta Conference in 1945.

In June 1946, the Kuomintang's central government of China reached a negotiated settlement with the leaders of the ETR, forming a coalition government which would eventually collapse in August of 1947.
