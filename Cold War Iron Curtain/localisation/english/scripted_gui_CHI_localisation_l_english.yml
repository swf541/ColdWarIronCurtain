The Kuomintang government, favoring policies of centralization and sinicization, has already taken various measures to align the Taiwanese province into the Chinese state. Taiwanese schools now emphasize Chinese language, history and a curriculum supporting the ideology of the Kuomintang. However, considering that the majority of the Taiwanese people have been disconnected from Chinas influence for over five decades, it is clear that they are not willing to adopt every doctrine laid out by a mainlander-dominated government.\n\n§RIf this modifier falls below -30% Stability and War Support the Kuomintang government will fall and the Republic of China will cease to exist.§! §!"

But following the defeat of the Beiyang clique, the party only focused on maintaining and expanding its power and fighting the Communist Party. Inefficient bureaucrats, corruption, factionalism and opportunism contributed to the downfall of the Kuomintang and its defeat against the Communist Party on the mainland. It is in our best interest to put an end to this misery and take steps to reform the Kuomintang into a united, efficient party, free of opportunists and corruption.§!"

The Premier has the duty of the representation of administrative policies and has to report proposed legislation to the Legislative Yuan. The Premier may serve as the Vice President, should the current Vice President take office as the President until the rest of the original presidential term is served. The Premier has to resign from office if a motion of no-confidence is initiated by the Legislative Yuan and approved with a simple majority. Given the enormous influence of Chiang Kai-shek's presidential position, it is unlikely that the Premier will hold any significant powers in the government as of now."

The Vice President also serves as the representative of the President if he is unable to attend office. If the Vice President assumes the presidency in case of the death, illness or resignation of the current President, the head of the Executive Yuan and Prime Minister of the Republic of China will fill the role of Vice President. The office, alongside with the presidential office, is given by the National Assembly every 6 years but holds very little formal power in the Republican government and heavily depends on the policy-agenda of the President§g."

However, they met strong resistance within the CPC from members such as Zhang Guotao and Zhou Enlai. Not surprisingly, they were assigned insignificant positions. During the 1930s, he became one of Mao Zedongs main political rivals within the CPC, embracing traditional marxist-leninist ideology in contrast to the beliefs of Mao. In 1937, he persuaded Mao to ally with Chiang Kai-shek in the face of Japanese aggression. During the war he continued to criticise Maos policy towards Japand and the Kuomintang. Despite growing illness, Wang continued to be Maos greatest critic and favourite candidate of Moscow, which ultimately enabled him to topple Mao as chairman of the CPC after the disasterous defeat in the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter 14 Years of Japanese occcupation, Manchuria finally returned to China.

He returned to Mongolia and joined the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in 1939 and served as Mongolia's minister of finance for a brief period. In 1940, at age 24, Tsedenbal was elected a member of the Central Committee, member of the Presidium, and general secretary at the MPRP's Tenth Congress, becoming the country's number-two leader.

Mongolia underwent collectivization of livestock, destruction of the Buddhist monasteries and Stalinist purges under the leadership of Khorloogiin Choibalsan.

Mao is in power once more now and is likely to purge the former administration and is seeking a new opportunity to unify China under the red banner.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter 14 Years of Japanese occcupation, Manchuria finally returned to China. However the transition was everything but smooth. The Soviet occupation force violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 by handing Manchuria over to the Communist Party of China instead of the Kuomintang, giving the Communists under Mao Zedong a new base of operations against the Nanjing government. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the Chinese Communists, who were almost victorious in 1949 against the Kuomintang. When the forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek reached Beijing and almost destroyed the People's Liberation Army, the Soviet Union once again marched into Manchuria and established a Soviet Puppet state under the administration of the remnants of the Communist Party of China, leaving Manchuria in Soviet hands for now.§!"
