 greece.0.t:0 "Death of a Prime Minister"
 greece.0.d:0 "	Today Greece mourns one of its children. Themistoklis Sofoulis, our prime minister passed away at the age of 88. He was born in 1860 in Vathy in the island of Samos. He studies philosophy in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and then went to Germany where he specialized in archaeology. He entered in the Greek political arena after the declaration of union between Samos and Greece in 1913. Prior to this, he was involved in the Samian politics and played a big part on the union process. In the election of May 1915, Sofoulis was elected deputy in the Greek parliament and served as Interior Minister under Eleftherios Venizelos. When in 1920 Venizelos became self-exiled, Sofoulis took the leadership of the party. In 1924 he became Prime Minister for the first time. During the interwar period Sofoulis was one of the central political figures in Greece. After the Greece surrender to the Axis in 1941, Sofoulis remained passive as almost all Greek Politician. After the liberation, he became Prime Minister until April of 1946 and tried to prevent the outbreak of the civil war. However his efforts failed and as a result he abstained from politics for a short period of time. On 7 September 1947 he once again became prime minister in a coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party. Sofoulis undertook further efforts to end the civil war, by proposing to EAM a general amnesty and a new coalition government between it and his party. However, these proposals were collapsed under heavy USA pressure and so the civil war took its course."

 greece.1.r:0 "We will see how this goes.."
 greece.2.t:0 "Alexandros Diomidis remains Prime Minister"
 greece.2.d:0 "After a few days of negotiations the Laiko Komma and the Komma Fileleutheros agreed to support Alexandros Diomidis as successor to Sofoulis in the premiership. Diomidis takes office on the 30 of July 1949, with the Civil war still going.."
 greece.2.r:0 "Difficult days for Diomidis..."
 greece.3.t:0 "Uniting the democratic faction"
 greece.3.d:0 "The old Venizelist faction is still split in various bigger and smaller parties. This makes very difficult to antagonize the Right which even though now is in the opposition, it seems that is gets stronger day by day. We focused many times on united the various Venizelists into one party, but the attempts were unsuccessful. However, a last chance to achieve that impossible goal is standing ahead..."
 greece.4.t:0 "Electoral reform debate"
 greece.4.d:0 "It is widely acknowledged that our current electoral system failed to provide the country with stable governments that are able to fulfill their term. As a result there is an increasing amount of voices advocating for a radical reform of the current system. They support that it is essential for the future of Greece to move towards an enhanced majority system in order to acquire stable governments and move away from fragile multiparty parliamentary majorities. Also both the US embassy and the Palace are clearly in favor of the enhance majority system. It would not be wise to oppose them. However, behind the proposed system there are dangers. We should forget that Papagos party came first in the elections, even though he failed to form a government. Adopting the enhanced majority system, we might unknowingly give him a strong one-party majority in the next parliament. "
 greece.6.t:0 "Alexandros Papagos Dies"
 greece.6.d:0 "In January 1955 prime minister Alexandros Papagos began to develop gastric issues, a result of his previous imprisonment during the war. Thus, he appointed Stefanopoulos to serve as provisional prime minister until he overcomes his illness. However, Papagos' condition kept worsening, until today, when our prime minister left his last breath due to a severe lung hemorrhage."
 greece.7.t:0 "Karamanlis sworn Prime Minister"
 greece.7.d:0 "After Papagos death, King Paul in a surprising move, appoints Konstantinos Karamanlis as Prime Minister. Karamanlis appointment took the Greek political life by surprise, because the King bypassed two senior members of Papagos party, Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos who were widely considered as potential successors of Papagos. After becoming Prime Minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Ellinikos Synagermos as the Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosi."
 greece.8.d:0 "This morning, we received horrifying accounts that a series of earthquakes with a combined magnitude of approximately 6.8 hit the Ionian Islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos. Two British Royal Navy vessels were the first on the scene to provide emergency aid and in initial reports the damage to the region appears to be severe. So far, casualties have been estimated to be at least 400 people dead and wounded, and the economic impacts of the quake appear extensive, as several top economists have already estimated the financial cost of the earthquake to extend into the billions."
 greece.9.d:0 "Prime Minister [GRE.GetLeader] has introduced new legislation! In reaction to the ongoing epidemic of young rabble rousers, the legislation has now allowed for punishment of their silly pranks and harsh words. Along with penalizing the use of foul language such as \"gamo teen Panagia sou,\" \"skeela,\" and \"malakas,\" the law also gives specific penalties for rapscallions who throw food onto or assault old people. Specifically, they will be taken to their local detention center, their heads shaved, and their parents prosecuted. Further, they will be shamed in the streets for their crimes! Though some protest the law due to its punishments, many celebrate [GRE.GetLeader]'s solution to the rampaging youths."
 greece.10.d:0 "Greece's close alliance and cooperation with the United States has preserved its independence since the turbulent 1940s. The Greek people had dealt with occupation forces from Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In addition the nation has only recently come out of a Civil War which saw the defeat of the Greek communists. The outbreak of the Korean War has seen the United States call on all its friends and allies to contribute to the cause. Many in the cabinet and senior military officers believe Greece should offer equipment and men to demonstrate its commitment to its American allies and anti-communism. However, many politicians and everyday Greeks are of the opinion the country is too war weary and should not be involved in foreign wars. However, after close negotiations with its party members and political allies, the Greek Prime Minister was able to convince them to support a Greek intervention in Korea. The Greek military is now drawing up options with their American counterparts on how Greece can contribute to the struggle against communism in Korea. Supporters of the intervention say like the Greeks, the South Koreans are victims of communist aggression and it is only fitting that the Greeks come to aid them in their desperate defense."

PDG.1.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the execution of Stefanos Sarafis. Sarafis, who commanded the DRG General Staff during the civil war was killed on the orders of Chairman Nikos Zachariadis. The government claimed Sarafis had questionable ties overseas and his motivations for joining the DRG were always suspect. The government noted Sarafis was not a party member before the war and only joined when captured. Analysts suspect the execution is a move meant to consolidate the position of Zachariadis as the head of both the party and military."
PDG.2.d:0 "Following the victory of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) in the recent civil war, the new government has initiated a Red Terror across Greece. Those accused of collaborating with the fascists during the Axis occupation, supporters of the Kingdom of Greece, and those within the party whose loyalty is suspect are being arrested. There are already reports of summary executions and new courts being established. The DRG is calling on all Greeks to help the communist party identify traitors and claim the revolution can only begin flourish once all internal enemies are dealt with."
PDG.3.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. This marks a major shift in the communist party following the takeover of the party by reformists during the recent Congress Meeting. The reformists fear the hardline wing of the party was far too aligned with the Soviet Union and initiating policies that were alienating the population. They feared this would eventually lead to either a violent uprising or Greece being dragged into another major war. The Soviet Union announced an emergency session of the Politburo will be called to discuss the situation in Greece."
PDG.4.d:0 "In a surprise shift, former communist party chairman Nikos Zachariadis regained control of the party. It appears the reformists attempt to shift away from Moscow backfired. Most communist members were already uncomfortable with the new direction from Moscow, but also oppose the reformist agenda. They see Nikos Zachariadis as the best hope for the fledging communist regime. Zachariadis already rejects the new direction being advocated by the Soviets and remains committed to keeping Greece on a true revolutionary path."
PDG.5.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it will not oppose the decision of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) to leave the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet action will be well-received by the reformist faction currently controlling the Greek communist party. It appears the Soviets wish to depart from the hardline stance of the Stalin era and show it can maintain relations with socialist states not in its umbrella. The Soviets may have also calculated its action will help the party solidify its control of Greece. Whether Greece will reciprocate and keep strong bilateral ties remains to be seen."
PDG.6.d:0 "Famed Greek communist military and guerilla leader Marshal Markos Vafeiadis has taken control of the party and the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Although an established military commander, he had a falling out with former leader Nikos Zachariadis and had at one point been exiled to Moscow. Vafeiadis is seen as a believer in an independent Greece with a strong admiration for the socialist leader Josep Tito. Whether he can guide Greece towards a non-aligned socialist state remains to be seen." 
PDG.7.d:0 "Pemier Charilaos Florakis, an established communist statesman, has taken control of the communist party. Although a firm member of the party, Forakis was rumored to be among of those most concerned with the hardline approach of Nikos Zachariadis and his faction. Many observers and Greeks expect a relaxation of policies and a more inclusive approach. His first statement upon assuming power appears to support this as he called on all Greeks to come together and heal in peace."
PDG.8.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece submitted an application to join NATO. Recent reforms saw an unprecedented democratization across the country. The political transformation of the government and reforms has transformed Greece into a state incompatible with the Soviet Union or what it views as a socialist state. Another motivation to join NATO is a fear that the Soviets may chose clandestine or even over means to stop the new direction of Greek socialism. Many members of NATO see the potential inclusion of the DRG as a major victory both strategically and politically."
PDG.9.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) declared its support of anti-revisionism. Greek communists are in an uproar over the recent actions by the Soviet Union to condemn Stalinism and move away from its positions. The DRG believes what the Soviets call reforms is in reality a shift away from revolutionary socialism towards state capitalism. The DRG states it will continue to champion socialism and urge all socialist states to remain steadfast."
PDG.10.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the centuries long struggle for enosis has finally been achieved. DRG aid proved critical in forcing the withdrawal of Britain from Cyprus and its capture by Greek Cypriotes. The DRG also succeeded in breaking up and purging the EOKA of its royalist and clergy leadership to transform the Cypriote resistance group into a revolutionary force. In response to threats coming from Turkey, the DRG stated it will not compromise or give up on bringing socialism to all Greek peoples."
PDG.11.d:0 "Mount Athos, a historic and important center of the Greek Orthodox Church monasticism has been closed by the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Mount Athos, an island in northeastern Greece, has for centuries been the home of monasteries and monks. Under the Greek constitution of 1927 the island enjoyed autonomy and administered itself. However, government troops recently stormed the island and removed all the monks. The DRG stated it had liberated the island for the people and eliminated the corrupt influence of the church. Although the government is hailing its actions as a victory, many Greeks are likely to view this direct attack on religion negatively."
PDG.12.d:0 "Greece opened its first government session in Constantinople, officially moving the capital of the country to the city. The Democratic Government of Greece (DRG) received the city and its surrounding area following the partition of Turkey by the Soviet Union. The shift to the capital appears to be the final step of the integration of these lands. For the Greek communists, the return of Constantinople as the capital symbolizes the unification of Greece and its people under socialism."
PDG.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union launched a blistering condemnation of the continued British occupation of Cyprus. The Soviets note the hypocrisy of Britain and its allies who call for self-determination in socialist states when it is openly suppressing the wishes of the Cypriote people. The Soviet diplomatic offensive will put the British under intense pressure. The Soviet focus on Cyprus appears to be a response to requests from the communist Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). The DRG continues to champion the cause for the decolonization of Cyprus and its unification with Greece. Many Greeks feel a kinship with the Cypriote Greeks who make up the majority of the population on Cyprus."
PDG.14.d:0 "The United Nations voted to admit the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). This is a major diplomatic victory for the new communist state as it consolidates its control over the country following a violent civil war. The socialist nations all voted to admit Greece, along with many newly independent states. A number of allies for the former Kingdom of Greece either abstained or voted against the admission in protest."
PDG.15.d:0 "The Greek Civil War has ended in victory for the Communist Party of Greece. The new regime quickly announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Greece. This marks the end of the Kingdom of Greece. Many socialist states have already recognized the new government, announcing plans to establish or expand embassies in the country. Allies of the defunct Kingdom of Greece have closed their embassies but will likely return in time. The people of Greece anxiously await what the new regime will bring."
PDG.16.d:0 "Markos Vafeiadis, famed communist Greek resistance and military leader was ousted from the party and is said to be in exile. His removal followed an intense investigation of party leaders. Vafeiadis was accused of harboring divergent revolutionary views. Due to the threat he poses to the internal security and revolutionary path of Greece, he has been voted out of the party. Markos Vafeiadis, fearing arrest, fled to Moscow where he denies the accusations against him. His removal will severely weaken the position of his supporters within the party."
PDG.17.d:0 "Millions of ethnic Turks are currently being driven out of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Greek officials and troops are organizing the deportations of what the government calls a dangerous fifth column within the state. The Greek action is being widely criticized internationally and the Turkish government is accusing the DRG of creating a refugee crisis in Anatolia. Greece recently took possession of Turkish lands following the partition of the country by the Soviet Union."
PDG.18.d:0 "Following its occupation of Izmir,Edirne and Istanbul after the Soviet partition of Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced it was renaming the cities. Izmir will return to its Greek name of Smyrna,Edirne to Adrianople while Istanbul will become Constantinople. The Greek government claims this is a return to the historic norm and that for centuries these Greek lands had been occupied by Turkish invaders. Many Greeks welcome the move, though there is international concern over the fate of Turks still living in these cities."
PDG.19.d:0 "Following a failed attempt by reformists to take control of the Communist Party of Greece, Chairman Nikos Zachariadis announced the execution of Charliaos Florakis. Florakis was tried for having counter-revolutionary tendencies and close association with enemies of the people. His demise solidifies Zachariadis control of the party. Florakis was a noted communist statesman and one of the principle leaders of the reformist wing. Reformists are growing concern that the death of Florakis may pave the way for a wider purge in the party."
PDG.20.d:0 "Markos Vafeiadis, noted communist resistance and military leader was assassinated. The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the news and its determination to uncover all those involved in the plot. Details of the assassination have not been revealed. His views on socialism and forging an independent path for Greece made him opponents both within the party and internationally. It is unknown which of his opponents were involved. His death marks a major blow to his supporters in the party."
PDG.21.d:0 "Premier Charilaos Florakis was dismissed by communist party head Markos Vafeiadis. This marks a consolidation of power by Vafeiadis over the ruling reformist wing of the party. It appears the two men had a falling out over the policies being implemented. Experts believe Florakis was advocating a more inclusive, liberal vision for the country but Vafeiadis found it to be counter-revolutionary and divergent. Florakis, a statesman within the party, will likely go into retirement."
PDG.22.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the execution of Nikos Zachariadis. The former party chairman was tried by a special court which found him guilty of counter-revolutionary activities and crimes against the people. Nikos Zachariadis led the party during the civil war and its early years, however, his hardline policies proved unpopular among reformists and many Greeks. His execution will strengthen the position of current party leader Markos Vafeiadis and offer a stark warning to those in the party that were sympathetic to Zachariadis."
PDG.23.d:0 "In a major announcement, the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced its embrace of Titoism. The Greek government believes Titoism offers a more authentic and effective approach to developing socialism in the country. It also marks a rejection of the Soviet model. More importantly, it appears the DRG hopes to forge a more independent socialist model and foreign policy. This will gain much support among the people who are weary of Greece finding itself in a future international conflict."
PDG.24.d:0 "Premier Charilaos Florakis published news that former party chairman Nikos Zachariadis has been exiled from the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). As chairman and leader during the civil war, Zachariadis sought a hardline and rapid socialist transformation for the country. However, his policies largely alienated the reformist faction within the party and many Greeks. His exile will likely weaken his supporters within the party and pave the way for further reforms in the country." 
PDG.25.d:0 "The people of Greece are enjoying an unprecedented period of liberalism under Premier Charilaos Florakis. As leader of the communist party and the Democratic Republic of Greece, he has moved away from the hardline revolutionary approach and lifted many restrictions. Even before communist rule was established, Greeks had long been under restrictions, whether from authoritarian leaders, foreign occupiers, or wartime conditions. Florakis has ably implemented his reforms without provoking a countercoup."
PDG.26.d:0 "Reports from the Democratic Republic of Greece indicate the government is emptying its gulags. This marks the latest reform by Premier Charilaos Florakis. The Greek Premier recently initiated a series of liberal reforms to the state. Many Greeks will welcome the decision as many have loved ones detained in the facilities. More hardline members of the party are likely to be upset but so far Premier Florakis appears capable of managing the different factions of the party." 
PDG.27.d:0 "There is international outrage following reports that the Democratic Republic of Greece demolished the Church of Panagia Megalochari on Tinos. The church complex was built around a miraculous icon found by a nineteenth century nun. Greeks have visited the shrine for decades, claiming miracles have occurred. The communist government claims the shrine is a sham meant to poison the minds of the people and spread superstitions. The government claimed to have confiscated jewels and silver in the name of the people. The destruction of the historical and symbolic church will likely alienate a large number of Greeks."

PDG.28.d:0 "News of the Secret Speech and its contents have caused a stir within the ruling communist party in the Democratic Republic of Greece. The condemnation of Stalinism and calls for reforms in the implementation of socialism is proving controversial. Many communist leaders argue the Soviet shift represents a divergence away from socialism. The leadership of the party met in an emergency meeting. It was decided that the government will distance itself from Moscow as it assesses the impact of this new change."
PDG.29.d:0 "For many communists, the Greek Orthodox Church represents an institution of oppression and superstition. However, the church remains an important part of many of our people. The church also enjoys a high reputation for its role in the resistance and Greek independence. The party must decide how to deal with the church. One faction believes the party should crackdown on the church and work to end its dangerous influence. Another faction argues the church can be co-opted into the state, as is done in other socialist states. They argue the church can become a powerful vehicle to spread socialism to the masses."

PDG.30.d:0 "The Greek government requested our help in their goal of Enosis, the unification of Greece with Cyprus. Cyprus is currently under the colonial administration of Britain and is facing resistance from the majority Cypriote Greeks. It maybe in our interests to offer diplomatic support in order to position ourselves as champions for anti-colonialism. We can also offer the diplomatic support with covert aid to undermine the British. It would strengthen our position in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, if the risks of a Western reaction are too high, we can decline the Greek request."
PDG.31.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government could not offer any public or covert aid to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government expressed its sympathies for the anti-colonial struggle, but it cannot involve itself at this time. This is a major blow for our goals regarding Cyprus. The government must accept that it must support Cyprus on its own. There are some in the party openly questioning our own commitment to toeing the Soviet line internationally if they are unwilling to help us with such an important issue."
PDG.32.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government will offer diplomatic support to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government completely sympathizes with the anti-colonial struggle and desire of the people of Cyprus to unite with Greece. The ambassador added it was a crime that the unification has been delayed by centuries of imperialism and capitalist violence. However, the Soviet government cannot offer covert aid. This is a positive development, though it is disappointing the Soviets are unwilling to directly aid our efforts. We hope the political pressure brought to the British will push them to end their occupation."
PDG.33.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government will offer diplomatic support to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government completely sympathizes with the anti-colonial struggle and desire of the people of Cyprus to unite with Greece. The ambassador added it was a crime that the unification has been delayed by centuries of imperialism and capitalist violence. The Soviet government will also provide covert aid to support liberation efforts on Cyprus. The Soviet military attache and intelligence officer will soon begin coordinating with the Ministry of Defense. This is a major boost to our efforts on achieving Enosis."

PDG.38.d:0 "Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the KKEs crushing victory over the whites in the Greek Civil War. To celebrate, the Central Committee has prepared a large parade demonstrating the many achievements the Greek people have accomplished over the past decade. Notable appearances include a float depicting the reconstruction of the nation, columns of new Main Battle Tanks constructed in the city of Athens, and a stunning music concert featuring the Alexandrov Ensemble. Although many problems still plague the red Mediterranean nation, today is a day for celebration as Greeks at home and abroad celebrate a new age in Greek history."
PDG.39.d:0 "Today, the Dimitrios Partsalidis Oil Rig unexpectedly caught fire at 2:34 AM near the island of Crete. The rig, belonging to the Democratic Republic of Greece, suffered a critical failure in one of its oil-containment cylinders, leading to an unknown amount of Oil spewing into the Mediterranean Sea. Total failure of the rig was only stopped by Greek workers, able to keep the fire from spreading to the extraction site. It is estimated that 10 people have died and an unknown number injured. The Democratic Republic of Greece has refused to comment on the situation as multiple countries from both sides of the iron curtain demand answers."
PDG.40.d:0 "At 12:20 AM, the Velouchiotis oil rig (a sister to the infamous Partsalidis rig) suffered a catastrophic failure and exploded, killing an estimated 24 people. The fire was put out quickly with help from a Soviet battlecruiser in the area. Soon after, however, specialists realized that the force of the explosion knocked all four spudcans out of place, opening the oil reserve into the Mediterranean. At daybreak, the ocean appeared black as millions of petroleum barrels jetted into the sea. The effects have been catastrophic on wildlife as the marine ecosystem gets carpeted in sludge. Yugoslavia, Italy, Israel, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt have all reported large amounts of contaminated fish and demand a quick fix to the disaster. As of now, the Democratic Republic of Greece has again refused to comment, and many are worried the KKE is distancing itself from the disaster."
PDG.42.d:0 "Yesterday, the Democratic Republic of Greece announced the formation of the Revolutionary Treaty of Friendship and Labor, many have come to dub “the Anti-Revisionist Bloc”. Although currently only containing Greece, many hardline communist nations are expected to join in the coming days. The Soviet Union has been quick to condemn this new pact as an act of aggression against socialist unity and peace. The Red Army has already begun mobilizing for a potential armed conflict in the Balkans as a new side joins the Cold War."
PDG.43.d:0 "Now that our country is stabilized, we can begin to tap into the rich waters of the Mediterranean. Every year, fishing boats return with larger and larger catches. As well as food, large oil reserves have been found in our eastern waters. These bounties must be harvested and used to improve the lives of our people."
PDG.44.d:0 "At 2:34 AM, the left oil-containment cylinder suffered a critical failure and burst. An LEEA report has concluded the cause to be a lit cigarette that rolled off a maintenance platform and into a piece of machinery. Although clearly the direct cause of the incident, many in the intelligence community believe the true cause was an overworked crew attempting to reach increasingly high quotas. Many in the party are calling for a swift end to mass drilling, while others assure this was a one off case."
PDG.45.d:0 "Disaster has struck on the Velouchiotis oil rig. A maintenance failure caused air pockets to form in oil being extracted. One spark caused everything to go up in flames. We must fix this mess before it is too late."
PDG.46.d:0 "The small city of Xania on the island of Crete has become unsafe for habitation. Oil and fire now ravage the coast as food becomes ever more scarce. We must divert every available ship in our arsenal to getting the people of this city to safety before it's too late."
PDG.47.d:0 "The recent oil rig crisis has emboldened fishermen and environmentalists to protest our resource extraction methods in the Mediterranean. Specifically siting toxic waste dumps in the sea and overfishing, environmentalists believe that without reform, the eastern Mediterranean will become unsuitable for aquatic life. While the LEEA assures us these acts of dissidence are not counter revolutionary, they advise dealing with the protests sooner rather than later. For this reason, the Ministry of Environmental Conservation has been created to advise planners and maintain Greece's natural beauty."
PDG.48.d:0 "While our many environmental reforms have raised Greek life expectancy and drastically lowered the chances of a disaster, the regulations have harmed productivity. Greek planners have warned that the continued halt to productivity will drastically harm our nation. We must encourage the Greek proletariat to work even harder."
PDG.49.d:0 "For the past few years, we have been limiting Soviet influence with the eventual goal of leaving them for our Chinese comrades. Within a year, we will be strong enough to leave our Soviet masters and continue the revolution with Mao. Yet, a growing number of moderates have voiced their concern with leaving the safety of the Warsaw Pact. While the Soviets sometimes impose their will on our proud people, their generosity in helping us rebuild cannot be forgotten. With luck, they argue, a continued positive relationship with the USSR will help both nations and the revolution."
PDG.50.d:0 "Our new alliance must grow if we are to surpass the social imperialism of the Soviet Union and her puppets. Around the world, true Marxists gather to our combined struggle for liberation and sovereignty. Send the call for combined class struggle."
PDG.51.d:0 "Our Greek comrades have invited us to the Revolutionary Treaty of Friendship and Labor. While we see eye to eye on many issues and can gain a lot from cooperation, many advisors have warned us that public endorsement of this new alliance will put us in danger of a possible war with the USSR. What should we do?"

PDG.56.d:0 "After only days after the Anti-Revisionist Blocs founding, the Soviet Union and many Warsaw Pacts nations have announced a state of war with the Anti-Revisionists. The USSR has stated that “Fanaticism and division anywhere is a threat to world peace everywhere. Already, Soviet armor has poured into the Balkans and rumors have spread of massive Warsaw Pact troop movements in the far east. The PRC has offered a strong warning that any further expansionist imperialism will result in war. The United States has called for a peaceful resolution and condemned any military action on the Eurasian continent. However, these strong words are unlikely to change much as the Soviets cross into Anti-Revisionist territory."
PDG.55.d:0 "The treacherous Greeks have announced the formation of the Revolutionary Treaty of Friendship and Labor. These fanatics are a direct insult to Marxist-Leninism and world peace. We must act quickly before this new alliance gains traction across the Third World. Two plans have been put forward. The first has been proposed by the Red Army. They suggest a quick full-scale Warsaw Pact intervention in the Balkans and East Asia. They believe our superior airpower will be more than a match for the vast manpower pools of the Anti-Revisionist Bloc. The second plan proposed comes from the KGB. Ample evidence supports the claim that the Anti-Revisionist Bloc is internally divided and disorganized. This disorganization can be easily exploited and with manipulation, we can turn the bloodthirsty hoards against one another. Only one option can be chosen."



#Turkey_Events
SRT.1.d:0 "Today the Soviet Military Government in Turkey under General Pavel Batov has announced the formal establishment of the Socialist Republic of Turkey. The General declared that by the end of the month, the 100,000 mostly Turkic soldiers of the Red Army will be withdrawn from Anatolia and authority will be transferred to the civilian government under General Secretary Sefik Husnu. International observers from both sides of the iron curtain expect the transition to be smooth and peaceful as Soviet soldiers leave the new nation as conquerors. The US and her allies can only watch in horror as the Soviet Steamroller claims another nation."
SRT.2.d:0 "The world stands still in grief today as the Socialist Republic of Turkey announced the sudden death of former president Ismet Inonu. Inonu was found dead in his bathroom with 7 gunshot wounds. The Communist Regime has already arranged a state funeral in his honor. While having been a vocal critic of communism, Inonu surprised the world by endorsing the Soviet Union as the preferable world leader. Whether this statement was made in fear of Soviet retaliation for a less-than-favorable endorsement, or genuine love for the working class is unknown. This, along with the identity of the assassin, is likely to remain a mystery for the foreseeable future."
SRT.3.d:0 "Immediately following the Death of Stalin, Turkish textile workers took to the streets demanding better pay. The next day, well-armed steelworkers and farmers from the outskirts of Ankara flocked to the protests. Outnumbered and outgunned, Soviet garrisons and the Turkish Police opened fire on a peaceful demonstration. What followed was a violent uprising as Turkish Protesters broke into the Ankara national armory. While at first being hailed as a triumph for freedom and democracy, the uprising devolved into a disorganized riot with widespread reports of looting and arson. The whereabouts of General Secretary Husnu are unknown, but rumor has it that he has fled the city along with the remaining members of the central government."
SRT.4.d:0 "For the first time in a month, the sun sets on a peaceful Ankara. General Secretary Sefik Husnu has announced to the world that order has been completely restored in the nation’s capital. Stability was restored thanks to the brilliant tactics and resolve of Propaganda Minister Guzin Dino and her friend Nazim Hikmet. The two artists turned revolutionaries secured control of the city without firing a shot by making strategic deals and concessions with individual rioting groups. The success of this strategy has given TKP officials the confidence to release a barrage of human-rights protections, including complete freedom to strike, the right to a legal defense in court, and outlets to express criticism with the Turkish state."
SRT.5.d:0 "Not one week since the riots began, stability has returned to Ankara. General Secretary Sefik Husnu has announced to the world that order has been completely restored in the nation’s capital. The speed at which this feat was accomplished can  be attributed solely to Husnu’s bruiser, Sevket Sureyya Aydemir. Known as an ideological fanatic to his colleagues and a hero to Turkish nationalists, Aydemir has found a new reputation with the people of Ankara as a butcher. Mere days after the riots started, Aydemir released the full might of the Turkish Army on the dissidents. Reports of indiscriminate fire quickly escalated into systematic and mass executions all throughout the city. While stability has returned to the city, many ask “at what cost?”"
SRT.7.d:0 "Many thought Ismet Inonu’s political career was finished after the Soviet takeover of Turkey. These beliefs, however, were proven wrong today when the former President and hero of the independence war gave a speech to the people of Turkey declaring their beloved national icon had returned to lead them once more. While domestic policy is rumored to be the same as the old regime, Inonus government has already begun the process of “Desovietization” which involves the expulsion of all Soviet troops, restoring Turkish nationalism, and severing diplomatic ties with Moscow and the eastern bloc. It is clear that the short-lived communist era in Turkey is coming to an end however one question on both sides of the iron curtain remains; “what now for Turkey?”"
SRT.8.d:0 "Today, crowds rushed to the street across Turkey in celebration as the charismatic poet turned revolutionary Nazim Hikmet was declared the second General Secretary of the TKP. In the aftermath of the Ankara Riots, Nazim Hikmet became a national hero, giving him the legitimacy to consolidate power. In a brief statement to the nation, Hikmet has promised further cultural liberalization as well as an end to forced labor and the abolition of all artistic restrictions. International reactions vary wildly to the new development. Nikita Khrushchev enthusiastically congratulated the new Turkish General secretary while Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha has warned that the loosening of proletarian discipline will result in the consolidation of a reactionary bureaucratic class. For now though, the Socialist Republic of Turkey remains a strong nation with a promising future. "
SRT.9.d:0 "Turkey stood in shock today as the TKP expelled Ismet Inonu from the communist party for “not displaying the cognitive ability to preform complex tasks”. In a medical report leaked to the press, Inonu was found to have an IQ of only 84, a tumor in his cerebral cortex, and a severe case of schizophrenia. Many Turks are in disbelief at the former presidents staggering fall from grace. On the other side of the Iron Curtain, multiple human rights and medical organizations have condemned the report, stating the test was “most likely fabricated and intentionally leaked to the press”. The Turkish government denies these claims and states their actions to remove Inonu from the public was a choice to “protect him from himself”. "
SRT.10.d:0 "Today, both the east and west watched with nervous anticipation as Sevket Sureyya Aydemir announced that the “Turkish proletariat stood victorious over the reactionary elements of the TKP”. Aydemir, a long-time armchair Marxist Nationalist first made a name for himself during the Ankara Riots where his brutal and systemic crackdown of the city earned him the nickname “The Butcher of Ankara”. As of now, a mix of revolutionary zeal and panic shake the nation. Moscow refuses to comment on the situation developing in Anatolia however reports of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet sailing to small costal towns along the Turkish cost to evacuate Eastern Bloc tourists along with Turkish civilians have been confirmed by international observers."
SRT.11.d:0 "Officials from the Socialist Republic of Turkey have formally announced the withdrawal of Turkey from the Warsaw Pact. To the new Turkish administration, the direction of Moscow and Ankara have become incompatible. The few Soviet and Greek garrisons in Anatolia have been evacuated and the Red Army has been placed on standby should any harm come to the departing troops. While many in Turkey are concerned of Soviet intervention, many have noted that the size and geography of the Republic would prove to be too costly for any Soviet action."
SRT.12.d:0 "Surprising news has come out of Red Turkey as Propaganda Minister Guzin Dino announced multiple queer rights laws had been passed by the Turkish Supreme Soviet. The socialist republic will now allow courts to grant same sex unions, abolish the discrimination of sexuality in religious institutions, and finally, allow openly homosexuals to participate in both the TKP and National Workers Army. This act has brought the discussion of sexuality into the limelight across the Eastern Bloc and many expect a “Queer Spring” to echo throughout the socialist world as many gays are empowered to speak out."
SRT.14.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Republic (KDR) proclaimed its independence. The Turkish Socialist Republic and Soviet Union both agreed with the Kurdish request for a new Kurdish socialist state. The new government announced it will begin a new era of socialist development and prosperity for the Kurdish people. It also promised brotherly relations with all socialist states, especially its neighbors. Regional states, especially those with large Kurdish minorities are expressing concern that the KDR may become a lightning rod for instability."
SRT.17.d:0 "Today Premier Inonu of Turkey made a fiery speech at a small Turkish town on the border with the Soviet Union. In his speech, the Premier stated that “the lands of Constantinople, Erzurum, west Anatolia, and the caucus mountains shall be dominated by the rightful rulers of Anatolia.”. Responding to this fiery speech, the Soviet Red Army and Greek PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) has been placed on standby. In a rebuttal typical of the new Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev warned that “The armies of the Warsaw Pact are perfectly capable of defending their homelands from barbaric invaders… We will not just stop you, we will destroy you”. In direct response to Inonu, the Soviet Union also closed the vital Baku-Adana oil pipeline and has demanded all debt be paid back by the end of the month. With this development, it is likely that Premier Inonus bold words have shot Turkey in the foot."
SRT.18.d:0 ""
SRT.19.d:0 "Sefik Husnu, leader of the civilian government in Turkey and General Secretary of the TKP has announced to the world that the former Ottoman Empire, and the birthplace of most Turkish citizens was responsible for “a deed too heinous for a proper socialist people to overlook”. Forty years ago, the lands of Turkey were the spot of a genocide perpetrated by Turks on the Armenian and Greek proletariat. This event would later be called the Armenian Genocide. Husnu referenced Auferstanden aus Ruinen (The East German National Anthem) and how just like the GDR, all Turkish people should work toward letting “the light of peace shine, so that a mother never more mourns her son”. Complementing Husnus words, Turkish leaders of local governments have erected monuments to the hundreds of thousands of nameless victims of imperialist cruelty."
SRT.20.d:0 "Reports from Turkey indicate the Soviet Union recently confiscated the gold reserves of the country. The Soviets claim the confiscation is for the protection of the Turkish reserves from potential hostile threats and as repayment for the massive Soviet support. One Soviet official quietly noted their government provided gold to the republic in its early years and have a claim to the reserves. The Turkish and Soviet government are seeking to keep the news quiet. As news spreads, many Turks are expected to be alienated by this action, though it is unsure if they will react with public protests. Western governments are already releasing statements condemning the action."
SRT.21.d:0 "One huge issue of occupation has been the surrendering columns of the cowardly reactionary Turkish forces. As of now, they are being held in makeshift detention centers around Anatolia and the Caucuses with little food or water. Many divisions are organizing and Soviet weapons stashes disappear in greater and greater numbers. This issue must be dealt with quickly. We must ask Comrade Stalin what to do."
SRT.22.d:0 "The Soviet Occupation Government in Turkey has presented us with the pressing issue of Turkish POWs. After deliberation, the Politburo has come up with two possible solutions. The first is a textbook repeat of our actions in the great patriotic war. Just like German and Japanese POWs, Turkish POWs will be put to work rebuilding our great nation. While tempting, this could alienate the Turkish proletariat from our great socialist experiment. The second option is to send home and reequip the Turkish Army to fight for the working class. While expensive, this plan is guaranteed to win the Turkish people over and demonstrate Comrade Stalin's omnipotence."
SRT.23.d:0 "While the artillery guns lay silent, violence still plagues Anatolia. Both Turkish thugs and, to our embarrassment, brave soldiers of the Red Army have been harassing the large Greek Minority in the area. Commissars have been dispatched to protect the Greeks, it is obvious a more permanent solution is needed. We must consult Comrade Zachariadis."
SRT.24.d:0 "News from the newly liberated Turkey has come to us. The Soviet Occupation Government requests our help in keeping the peace between Greeks and Turks. Two plans have been given to us. The first involves rescuing our Greek Comrades and settling them in the newly liberated city of Constantinople. This could both give us a sizable population increase and turn our new capital into a majority Greek City. On the other hand, many believe it is our duty to heal relations with the Turkish People. The second plan involves a massive propaganda campaign designed to foster unity between our two socialist nations. It may be in the workers best interest that we extend the olive branch and make Anatolia a peaceful place for all peoples."
SRT.25.d:0 "Our occupation government has run into a large snag. Early Collectivization campaigns have demonstrated a systemic prejudice against Armenians. This prejudice boiled over yesterday when multiple Armenian Turks as well as 7 comrades in the 390th Rifle Occupation Division (composed of mostly Armenians)  were found brutally tortured beyond recognition. Clearly something must be done to ensure the safety of both the people and our soldiers. As of now, a telegram has been sent to Moscow requesting their guidance."
SRT.26.d:0 "Reports of violence against our Armenian comrades in Anatolia have begun to flood in. Something must be done. Due to the nature and complexity of the region, only two options seem feasible. The first option involves sending Armenian Turks to the newly conquered regions of the Armenian SSR. This would hopefully both reinforce our hold on the new region and give all Armenians a safe place to live. While arguably more effective, we wouldn't be resolving the problem, just kicking the can down the road. The second option is to go full steam ahead with socialist unity. Actions like offering Armenians more representation in government, forced diversification of the workplace, and most controversially, ordering the Turkish Civilian Government recognize the Armenian Genocide."
SRT.27.d:0 "With our conquest and liberation of Anatolia complete, the industrial base of the defunct Turkish state lay idle across the land. Red Army Commanders have tried to jumpstart Turkish industry in an attempt to repair relations with the civilian population however these efforts have mostly ended in failure. We must figure out what to do with before the precious industry rusts away in the wind. Luckily, Moscow has informed us they are organizing a permanent solution as we speak."
SRT.28.d:0 "With the reactionary Turkish state in shambles, her industry lies ripe for the taking. Many in the Kremlin, including the up and comer Kosygin believes that just like in Germany, Turkish industry should be transferred to the USSR for safekeeping. However, Pavel Batov, commander of the occupation government has personally written to Comrade Stalin expressing the need to utilize the might of the Soviet Union in building up the new Turkish state into a juggernaut. While more expensive, he believes this will rapidly decrease hostilities between the Turkish population and the socialist government leading to a more stable country in the future."
SRT.29.d:0 ""
SRT.30.d:0 "Due to poor health, Comrade Sefik Husnu has announced that he will be stepping down as general secretary of the TKP and will spend the last few months of his life in his dacha on the Black Sea. In his place, the Politburo has assumed total control of the nation. Before his exit, comrade Husnu has demanded the establishment of a pluralist leadership “based on  the values of compromise and solidarity”. Despite his request, it is clear battle lines are being drawn. On the far right of the politburo lies the TKP-CHP faction led by Kamalists loyal to the previous regime. They strongly believe Turkey should break with the International workers struggle and pursue positive neutrality. In the center lies the TKP establishment faction led by Khrushchevites loyal to Moscow. They believe the future of Turkey lies in solidarity with our comrades in the Warsaw pact. Finally, on the far-left lies the TKP-ML faction led by fanatic Turkish nationalists and anti-revisionists. Their vision for Turkey is a self-sufficient socialist state emphasizing technological progress and ideological loyalty. While officially, all factions work together, it is clear that in the coming months, there will be only one left."
SRT.32.d:0 "With the sudden death of General Secretary Nazim Hikmet, his right-hand woman Guzin Dino has taken charge of Red Turkey. A prominent writer and feminist theorist in the old republic, Dino worked her way up to minister for propaganda, where she became a favorite of both Husnu and Hikmet. Now the leader of the Turkish Socialist Republic, Guzin Dino plans to maintain Turkish foreign policy norms and continue the liberalizing movements started by Hikmet. Statements from Moscow and the wider eastern bloc, while muted, are more positive than negative as many in the Warsaw pact congratulate the new General Secretary. The future of Turkey, while always up in the air, will likely be one of reform at home, and expansion abroad."
SRT.33.d:0 "With the sudden death of General Secretary Nazim Hikmet, head of The People's Commissars Ismail Bilen has taken charge of Red Turkey.Now the leader of the Turkish Socialist Republic, Bilen plans to normalize society and bring stability to the Turkish people. This will likely involve a rollback of Hikmets liberalizing reforms, a clampdown on independent news organizations, and repairing ties with the Arab world. News of this development has been celebrated in both Moscow and Cairo, as Ankara continues its allegiance to the Soviet line."
SRT.34.d:0 "Today, blood was spilled on the steps of the Revolutionary People's Complex in Ankara as Officers loyal to the TKP-ML faction clashed with the Secret Service. Although the Officers were successful in breaching the capital building's outer defenses, they were repelled by the local garrison after the politburo was able to contact the Worker's Army of Turkey. As of now, a manhunt has been ordered by the General Secretary of the TKP, who has demanded that all conspirators be brought to Ankara for “high crimes against the Turkish workers and state”. With the coup decisively defeated, the eastern bloc breathes a sigh of relief as Soviet communism remains in Anatolia."
SRT.35.d:0 "Today, officers loyal to the TKP-ML faction stormed the capital building of the Turkish Socialist Republic. Although fiercely defended by the Turkish Secret Service, the officers were able to breach all defenses and broadcast a message stating the coups' success. Led by Chairman Ibrahim Kaypakkaya, the revolutionaries have vowed to end Soviet cultural imperialism and return Turkey to the workers and peasants. Both Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha have congratulated the new regime in Turkey and hope to strengthen ties with Kaypakkaya. Moscow, on the other hand, has denounced this act as illegal and has demanded harsh sanctions from the international community."
SRT.36.d:0 "Last night, elements of the Turkish Expeditionary Force crossed the border into the UAR to defend their ally against “Zionist aggression”. While ground forces are not yet present in substantial numbers, the Turkish Worker's Air Force has been deployed in large numbers and is now exchanging fire with Israeli pilots. Western nations have condemned this action and will likely petition the UN to intervene. While the Soviet Union has remained silent on the unfolding situation, it is likely they are in full support of Turkeys intervention. This development presents a seismic escalation in the Middle East as the clock moves closer to midnight."

#KRD_Events
KRD.1.d:0 "Premier of the KDR Ahmed Tofiq has released a statement urging all peoples of Kurdish origin to migrate to the new Kurdish state. He expressed the need for manpower and technical expertise to propel the nation into the future. Tofiq has promised employment, free housing, guaranteed clean food and water, and safty from imperialism and economic exploitation. Already, Kurds from around the world were inspired and have left the lands of Iraq, Iran, and Syria in droves for their new homes. It is expected that the KRDs population will triple by the end of the year."
KRD.2.d:0 "Shocking news has come from the Democratic Republic of Kurdistan as Premier Ahmed Tofiq publicly voiced his disdain for both the Socialist Republic of Turkey and General Secretary Husnu. Tofiq stated that “The damage Turks have done to the Kurdish people are an unforgivable stain on the region and can only warrant diplomatic isolation from the new Kurdish state”. His statement was complimented by Kurdish diplomats leaving Turkey and the freezing of all state communication. Tofiqs statement has sent shockwaves through the Eastern Bloc and the world as many call into question the nature of the Soviet Alliance and its strength. This statement has also angered both Ankara and Moscow greatly who were both quick to denounce Tofiqs statements as “Reactionary” and “childish” however it is likely no action will be taken against the small isolated nation."
KRD.3.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Republic is facing a massive drought across its territory. There are fears if the drought does not end soon, the country may face severe food shortage and starvation. The KDR economy is also largely agriculture, meaning the crisis threatens to cause an economic depression. The KDR is calling for socialist allies to step in and provide support for the fledging state. However, the crisis is being seen as confirmation by critics who argue the KDR as it stands is not sustainable."
KRD.4.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Republic (KDR) announced plans to rejoin the Turkish Socialist Republic. The KDR noted the new arrangement would maintain Kurdish autonomy and allow both peoples to live together under a just socialist state. The Turkish government welcomed the news and plans to host a unification ceremony in the capital. Analysts believe the KDR made the decision following economic and political hardships it has faced since independence. The decision is being well-received by neighboring states with Kurdish minorities who felt the KDR represented a destabilizing force."
KDR.5.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Republic (KDR) confirmed reports that its application to become the newest Soviet Socialist Republic of the USSR has been accepted. The Soviet government welcomed the news and announced plans to host Kurdish leaders in Moscow for an official ceremony. The KDR decision is largely being driven by the consequences of its struggle to handle a recent drought. The KDR leadership and Soviet Union both agreed a failure to act could result in an economic or political collapse. Internationally, the move is being condemned as an expansion of Soviet imperialism by the West but is being welcomed by most socialist and pro-Soviet states."
KRD.6.d:0 "Surprising news has come out of the KDR as the nation has denounced Marxist-Leninist doctrine in the region. While premier Ahmed Tofiq has confessed personal love for the Soviet style communism of rapid industrialization, he admits that the amount of manpower and resources required for the system has led the nation to economic and environmental disaster. The premier stated that the objective of Kurdistan would be to “bring the nation to a state of normalized sanctity”. In practice, this means a reintroduction of the tribal function, a decrease in political repressions, and extreme decentralization. In effect, Kurdistan will return to a pre-revolutionary feudal state ruled by a communist party. Moscow has denounced these actions but Tofiq has assured Kurdistan will remain loyal to the Kremlin while also slowly building up the infrastructure base required for rapid industrialization."
KRD.7.d:0 ""
KRD.8.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Republic is facing a second massive drought. The first drought caused massive food shortages and greatly destabilized the economy. This new drought threatens further economic decline and raises fears for the political stability of the state. The KDR is already calling for aid to deal with the crisis. However, even a massive influx of support may not be enough. Some in the government are quietly suggesting the KDR may need to seek an alternative solution. Soviet officials are said to be greatly concerned over the future of the socialist project in the KDR."
KRD.9.d:0 "Yesterday, the regions of Muhabad and South Azerbaijan in Iran were rocked as swarms of Kurdish refugees flooded the border. While Iran has expressed sympathy for the Kurdish refugees, Shah Pahlavi has stated that Iran is in no position to accommodate the half million refugees. This statement was soon confirmed as acres of land were stripped bare by hungry Kurds. When questioned as to why so many Kurds had flead the communist regime, both Iranian and UN surveyors were met with a wall of silence as not a single Kurd of the estimated half million refugees spoke. Although not much is known, two things have become clear. Northern Iran has spiraled into complete anarchy, and the communist Regime of the KDR must be more horrifying than anyone could have predicted."
KRD.10.d:0 "Shocking news rocks the world as for the first time since 1945, Soviet borders have expanded. What was once thought to be a retreat from Kurdistan, turned out to be a ruse. The waves of Kurdish “refugees” that flooded into Iran were not escaping, but expanding communism. The destabilization the rapid immigration brought made it impossible for Iran to mount a coordinated defense and the lands were quickly taken by joint Kurdish-Soviet forces. Despite the obvious disregard for international law committed by the Soviet Union, much of the blame has been pointed at the UN who failed to organize a response in time. The utter failure of international law has called into question the viability of the United Nations in keeping world peace. The consequences of incompetence displayed by both the UN and Iran can easily be demonstrated by columns of Soviet Armor rolling down Tabriz. As of now, the ramifications cannot be predicted however one thing is certain. Soviet Boots will likely never leave northern Iran."
KRD.11.d:0 "Shocking news rocks the world as the Red Army was halted in Iran. Just a few days ago, the Soviet Union along with the KDR launched a surprise attack on Iranian forces in South Azerbaijan. Although the waves of Kurdish refugees had destabilized the region, Iranian units mounted a brave defense of their homeland and routed the Joint Soviet-Kurdish invasion, capturing many top secret and experimental weapons in the process. The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact have become an international laughingstock with many comparing the USSRs performance in this engagement to the Winter War. Not much is known as to what is happening in the Kremlin however it is suspected that multiple officers have been relieved of duty and a reassessment of Soviet doctrine is underway. What is known is that the lands of Iran will stay Iranian for the fordable future."
KRD.12.d:0 "Today, the Democratic Republic of Kurdistan has been accepted into the United Nations. Many criticize the UN for giving another seat to a communist nation, however, the UN believes inviting in new members will strengthen its power and help guarantee international peace. The Kurdish Democratic Republic along with the Soviet Union, have both been enthusiastic supporters of UN membership for the new nation, and it is likely that more partially recognized nations will be able to join the United Nations."
KRD.13.d:0 "Although we finally have a state, the people who inhabit it are scarred with the memories of genocide and repression at the hands of Persians and Arabs. It is time for them to own up to the damages they caused our people. A letter has been submitted to both Iran and Iraq urging reparations to both our great nation and the ancestors of those wronged by imperialist exploitation and racism."
KRD.14.d:0 "The new Kurdish state has demanded our nation pay reparations to their people. While we unquestionably have the ability to repay them in full, and it might make strategic sense to foster positive relations with our new neighbor, bowing to any Kurdish state is below our nation. What should we do?"
KRD.15.d:0 "Although our mighty nation of Kurdistan has been liberated from imperialism and exploitation, much of our land still lies repressed under the yoke of foreign boots. By fate, some of this land has ended up in the hands of our comrades in the Soviet Union. While claimed by the Armenian SSR, the province of Erzurum is rightfully Kurdish. Because of this, a letter to Moscow has been sent urging the USSR to transfer Erzurum to the Kurdish people."
KRD.16.d:0 "Our Kurdish comrades have given us an interesting proposition. In the name of socialist unity and fairness, they request the state of Erzurum transferred from the Armenian SSR to the Kurdish Democratic Republic. While we would love to aid our Kurdish comrades in the liberation of their nation, we also have plans with this newly acquired land. What should be done?"
KRD.17.d:0 "Today is a proud day for socialism and the Kurdish people. The state of Erzurum, along with its people and industry, have been returned in full to its rightful owners. Already, our people celebrate in the street as our nation grows larger. Three cheers for our Soviet comrades, three cheers for comrade Ahmed Tofiq, and three cheers for Kurdistan!"
KRD.18.d:0 "Today is a dark day for Kurdish-Soviet relations. While the Soviets hold sympathies for our cause in the liberation of all Kurds, a letter from Moscow has stated that Erzurum is now rightfully Soviet. This decline has taught us that our “allies” in the Soviet Union no longer care for us. We must now work to become a shining example of the might of all Kurdish people on our own."
KRD.19.d:0 "What stared out as a normal dry season has spiraled out of control into one of the worst droughts in recorded history. Every day factory workers, mothers, and children die as they work from dehydration. Reports of farmers benign driven to clinical vampirism are becoming commonplace. Despite our best efforts, both the Socialist Republic of Turkey and the Soviet Union are unable to transfer nearly enough water to our nation. Something must be done quickly or there will be no one left."
KRD.21.d:0 "General Secretary Sefik Husnu of the SRT has written an open letter to our people. In his letter he urges, for the sake of the Kurdish people, the surrender our sovereignty and to rejoin Turkey as an autonomous region or the Soviet Union as an SSR. Should we accept, he promises the full might of both the Soviet and Turkish state will be committed to helping the Kurdish people survive and eventually rebuild the region into a red oasis. Should we accept, we will ensure the safety of our people at the cost of the nation we have fought centuries to free."
KRD.22.d:0 "Although previous reforms have secured us more water, drought will return to wreak havoc on our lands. This fact has led us to believe the only permanent solution is to expand. While there are many tempting targets in the region, Military High Command has chosen Lake Orumiyeh in Iran for its proximity to Van and its high Kurdish population. While Iran is an important puppet of the United States, we strongly believe the US will not have the stomach to start nuclear armogedon over a small Lake halfway across the world. Despite this belief, our plan hinges on Warsaw Pact participation in diplomatically stalling any response as well as a Soviet diversionary strike in South Azerbaijan. Until the day of the invasion, our goals shall be to hamper UN effectiveness and destabilize Iran."
KRD.23.d:0 "At long last, clean water flows from both our rivers and our sinks. Greenery returns to our great nation and for the first time there is life in the peoples eyes. With that said, most are under no illusion that the nightmare could return. A change in course must happen. Some in the party believe our failure was not committing hard enough to the industrialization of Kurdistan. While the new factories and farmland contributed to the drought, it was the lack of infrastructure that prevented the proper relief efforts from coming. Many in the party, however, believe we were doomed the moment the first factory complex was built. They suggest a halt to all industrialization efforts and a return to a  pre-revolutionary way of life. While both options present valid paths, only one can be chosen."
KRD.24.d:0 "While we have destabilized Iran and hampered any ability for an effective counterattack, the most important piece of the operation remains. It is now time to inform the Soviet Union of our intentions."
KRD.25.d:0 "Today we received a borderline insane proposal from the Kurdish Democratic Republic. While KGB informants have reported a military build up in the Kurdish state, no one predicted this. Because of the water shortages, the Kurds have expressed their desire for us to enter hostilities with Iran (a major US ally) and secure Lake Orumiyeh for their people. Many in the Kremlin have alread rejected this outlandish idea. If we assist in the invasion, we risk plunging the world into nuclear hellfire. However, if we accept, the Kurds have promised that the province of South Azerbaijan will be easy pickings. They also guarantee that because of their destabilization efforts, Iran will be unable to make an organized defense of the region. The Red Army has assured that within a week, 6 divisions can be called up for a possible invasion. One choice can be made, and we must choose wisely."
KRD.26.d:0 "Excellent news from the Soviet Union. As we speak, six of the finest divisions of the Red Army have been mobilized on the southern border. While they have not openly stated Soviet participation, we believe with absolute certainty that our invasion will be complemented by Soviet Armor. Victory in this struggle is all but assured as the final plans are finished. It is now only a matter of time..."
KRD.27.d:0 "Horrible news from the USSR. Not only have the Soviets refused to assist us with any invasion of a sovereign country, they have also demanded our complete demobilization. While many in the Kurdish Military wish to proceed alone, it is widely accepted that Lake Orumiyeh will remain out of our grasp."
KRD.28.d:0 "Today calls for celebration comrades. We celebrate the liberation of northern Iran from imperialism with food in our bellies and water in our mugs. Not only has the future of the Kurdish state been secured, but we have demonstrated that the true might of the Armies of the working class. As we speak, the cowardly Iranians retreat from our rightful land with their tails tucked. It is likely this day, along with the  heroes who made it possible, will be immortalized in the hearts and minds of all patriotic Kurds."
KRD.31.d:0 "Today, the Kurdish tricolor was raised over the city of Al-Hasakah as the Kurdish Democratic Republic assumed control of all Kurdish land in north Syria. This development has come in the wake of a military and economic pact between the KDR and UAR. In exchanged for the transfer of all Kurdish majority regions, Kurdistan (and the USSR) have agreed to finance infrastructure development in Syria, connecting the Warsaw Pact to her Arab ally. In addition to this, Kurdistan has agreed to intervene on the side of the UAR in any defensive war against Israel or the United States. This agreement, wile popular amongst those in both Cairo and Van, has outraged many in the Syrian provinces who believe this agreement was made to further weaken their influence over the republic."
KRD.33.d:0 "Yesterday, Sheik Ahmed Tofiq passed away peacefully in his study at 10:50 PM. While rumor quickly spread of assassination, the Kurdish Worker's Party has stated the official cause of death to be a brain aneurysm. The news of the first Kurdish premiers death has sent shockwaves across the nation, and a state funeral is no doubt being organized. As for the future of the Kurdish leadership, not much is known. It is likely however that the reins of power will either fall to foreign minister Dara Tawfiq or chief ideologue Sedigh Kamangar."
KRD.34.d:0 "Today, the Iraqi-Kurdish War has seen a dramatic escalation as forces from the Kurdish Democratic Republic intervened on the side of the Kurdish Rebels. While military action was predicted by CENTO and NATO analysts, the Kurds were successful in masking the true scale of their upcoming military operation. At 3:20 AM, the Kurdish Worker's Red Army launched a devastating artillery barrage that shattered forward Iraqi defenses. This coincided with airstrikes in Baghdad, Mosul, and Al-Fallujah that crippled the Iraqi high command and important military logistics networks. Two hours later, Kurdish armored divisions poured across northern Iraq, bypassing the few surviving defensive positions. Although it is unknown if Kurdistan can maintain the initiative in the coming months, it is clear that Iraq has been caught off guard and unprepared for such an offensive."
KRD.36.d:0 "To the disappointment of the International community, the militaristic communist Sedigh Kamangar has been elected premier of the Kurdish Democratic Republic. Considered the architect of the PKKs ideology, Kamangar has fought hard under Tofiq to secure as much land for the KDR as possible and guarantee a powerful future for his people. In speeches and televised addresses to the nation, Kamangar has vocally condemned Moscow's calls for coexistence with other states in the region. In addition to this, he has also railed against Soviet troops in the region, stating that “the Turkish boot been replaced with a Russian one”. The international community, and the Soviets in particular, are uncomfortable with this change in leadership and many fear a bloody future for the region."
KRD.37.d:0 "Today, diplomats of both the Kurdish Democratic Republic and Imperial State of Iran met in Erbil to sign a historic peace agreement. The so called “9 point treaty of Erbil” outlines the following - A bilateral agreement to the permanent demilitarization of northern Iran, as well as all future territorial exchanges between both countries. Kurdish payment of no less than 100 billion in reparations over a 10-year period, return all POWs and weapons to Iranian authorities. A Kurdish guarantee to respect the religious, cultural, and ethnic rights of Iranians and Shia Muslims within their borders. An Iranian guarantee to respect the religious, cultural, and ethnic rights of all Kurds within their borders. Free immigration of Iranian citizens out of East Azerbaijan. Recognition of the Kurdish Democratic Republic and its borders. A 15-year nonaggression and non-intervention pact between both parties. An immediate halt and withdrawal of all Kurdish orchestrated covert operations in Iran. Free and fair elections in the Kurdish majority regions of Iran to join the Kurdish Democratic Republic. Commentators on both sides of the iron curtain are ecstatic at the news of this historic agreement. While the future between these two middle eastern powers is uncertain, many feel optimistic as peace and diplomacy once again triumph over violence."
KRD.38.d:0 "As of this morning, the lands of Northern Iran see conflict once more as the Kurdish Democratic Republic shells the small town of Baneh. While it is unknown which side opened fire first, the Kurds have dramatically escalated the engagement, sending reinforcements to the region in the form of their new 18-inch Barzanji howitzer system and modernized T-34Us. While a change in territory is unlikely, it is clear the Kurds intend to keep up the pressure on the Iranian state."
KRD.39.d:0 "A dramatic change has occurred today in the Democratic Republic of Kurdistan. In a nearly unanimous vote, Kurdistan has been expelled from the Warsaw Pact for “Blatant disregard for international law and corrupting bourgeois nationalism”. This decision was immediately followed by Warsaw Pact troops demolishing the last of the infrastructure leading to their former ally in Kurdistan. In recent months, tensions between Van and Moscow have dramatically escalated over Kurdish militarism in the Middle East. While previously a strong ally, the USSR has become increasingly upset with aggressive Kurdish foreign policy, which upends their own objectives in the region. Although the Soviets and many Warsaw Pact nations have cut all economic and political ties, the Chinese and various national communist movements in Eastern Europe have vowed to ramp up military and political aid to the increasingly isolated middle eastern state."
KRD.40.d:0 "At precisely midnight, an artillery salvos echoed across Kurdistan. While the region has suffered endless conflict, today, the guns fire off not in anger, but celebration. Much like their comrades in Greece, the Kurds celebrate over a decade of communist rule in the Democratic Republic of Kurdistan. Throughout the day, the PKK organized events commemorating heroes of the Kurdish independence movement and achievements of the party and state. The most notable of these events was a large parade in the capital city of Van. Large floats commemorating everything from the Soviet liberation, to a state-of-the-art pipeline, to their controversial annexation of northern Iran were displayed down Victory square. Emulating soviet pageantry, the Kurdish Workers Red Army also took the opportunity to  show off missile systems, a new Kalashnikov Variant, and even a domestically produced Main Battle Tank. After the parade, Ahmed Tofiq congratulated the Kurdish people and called for the full liberation of Kurdistan by 1970 in a rare televised appearance. While celebrated in Kurdish Diasporas, many in the Arab world grow nervous of this increasingly militant republic."
KRD.41.d:0 "Today, the politburo of the Kurdish Workers Party elected foreign minister Dara Tawfiq Premier of the Kurdish Democratic Republic. A controversial figure in Kurdistan, Dara Tawfiq has promised to end the KDRs diplomatic isolation by normalizing relations with Iran and the west. In a statement to western journalists, Tawfiq stated the necessity to “make friends with the west” and avoid further economic damage to the civilian sector of the economy. Many on both sides of the iron curtain breath a sigh of relief as moderates take command of Kurdistan."
Tofiq_Death:0 "Ahmed Tofiq Has Passed Away"
KRD.42.d:0 "The Kurds have come to us with a tempting offer. In exchange for our majority Kurdish lands, the KDR will vow to take an active role in realizing our dream of a unified arab state."
