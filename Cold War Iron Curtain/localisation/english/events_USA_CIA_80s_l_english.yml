 # Sri Lankan Civil War
 CIA_SRL.0.d:0 "SRI LANKAN INSURGENCY: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn recent years, tensions between the Sri Lankan Government, dominated by the Sinhalese ethnic group, and the Tamil ethnic group, located in the north of the country, have escalated into violence. Tamils have alleged systemic discrimination against them in employment, education, and language, particularly concerning the 1970s policy of standardization which systematically limited Tamil students from gaining entrance into universities. (U/OU)\n\nThe Tamil opposition to government policy has existed in the form of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), acting as the legitimate political opposition since 1976; while militant groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been formed under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran. Both groups, while differing in their methods, desire for the creation of a secular, socialist state of “Tamil Eelam” located in the Tamil-majority north of the country. (S)\n\nRecent anti-Tamil riots and demonstrations, including one in 1977 that resulted in 125 deaths, and the burning of the Jaffna Public Library in 1981 by a Sinhalese mob, have continually increased tensions towards full civil war. Now, in 1983, the fire has begun to burn bright, particularly after a Sri Lankan Army patrol, known as “Four Four Bravo” was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. The period known as “Black July”, has resulted in multiple anti-Tamil pogroms, massacres of prisoners, and hundreds of deaths. (S)\n\nIt is estimated that the LTTE and other Tamil militant groups will continue to harass and outright fight Sri Lankan Army units. However, the situation is unclear outside of Sri Lanka; the influence of India in the conflict is unknown, although the presence of a sizable Tamil population in southern India may present obstacles to the Sri Lankan Government in putting down this uprising. (S)"
 CIA_SRL.1.d:0 "INDIA’S POSITION ON SRI LANKA: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIndia’s relative geopolitical position to Sri Lanka has presented significant issues to the Sri Lankan Government in its attempt to counter the insurgency by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). With Sri Lanka and India being only 35 miles apart from each other at their closest points, and the appearance of a significant Tamil population in southern India, it is our assessment that the Indian Government will attempt some measure of involvement in the conflict, likely on the side of the Tamil insurgents. (S)\n\nTamil groups, both in Sri Lanka, and in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, have developed strong relationships and cooperation. Specifically, the LTTE has developed relationships with officials from the Pure Tamil Movement and the Kamaraj Congress, as well as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G. Ramachandran, a prominent state official. (S)\n\nThe United States is faced with a challenge in responding to this conflict, and subsequent Indian involvement. It is clear that constraining Indian influence in the region is vital to ensuring that the Sri Lankan Government can continue its counterinsurgency operations unabated. The following are recommendations that can be taken to destabilize Indian influence in the region and take pressure off of Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Using the resources of the International Monetary Fund and other economic organizations to end loan access to the Indian Government\n\n2. Organizing Tamil-majority emigre groups on the Indian mainland, with the intent of forming militant organizations similar to the LTTE in Sri Lanka.\n\n3. Using diplomatic channels to pressure Pakistan into ceasing aid to the Sri Lankan Government, as well as beginning arms shipments to Indian Tamil militant groups.\n\nIt is our hope that this analysis and recommendation will effectively end Indian influence in the region, turn New Delhi’s focus away from their island neighbor, and allow a continuance of the status quo in the area."
 CIA_SRL.2.d:0 "As the Secretary of the Treasury walked into the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund, he was glad that it was so close. Only a short car ride away from the Treasury office buildings, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, it made visits like this simple, and easy, not requiring a flight and more importantly, press.\n\nOnly a few sets of stairs and an elevator ride, and the Secretary was sitting in the office of the Managing Director, the Frenchman Jacques de Larosiere, the most powerful man in the IMF. As the United States representative of the Board of Governors, the Secretary knew he had much influence on the operations of the IMF globally. Having thought over the contents of the CIA report he had read earlier, he knew what was required now.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Secretary. What can I do for you?” de Larosiere leaned back, setting down a cup of coffee on a saucer at his desk, with a view of the DC skyline behind him.\n\n“Jacques, you and I have known each other for a long time. Your leadership at the French Treasury, and now at the IMF, has been excellent. I need a favor from you.” The Secretary adjusted himself as he continued.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen the news or read the briefings from your government. India is increasingly getting involved in the Sri Lankan Civil War, funding the Communist Tamil rebels in the north. They are intentionally sabotaging the conflict and are costing millions of lives in the balance. We recommend that the IMF take action to sanction India for its actions and force them to take pressure off of Sri Lanka.”\n\n“Mr. Secretary. What exactly is your government proposing we do? India is also a consenting member of the IMF. I don’t see why we should get involved in this issue.”“Mr. de Larosiere, you are the Managing Director, the most powerful person in this organization. Our government proposes cutting off access to IMF loans to India. This would not require a vote and could just simply be a procedural matter that you implement, quietly. No press, no scandal, no nothing. It would mean a lot to us, Jacques.”\n\nde Larosiere paused. “Fine, Mr. Secretary. I will see what we can do to end loan access, but no promises. The IMF wants no blowback from this."
 CIA_SRL.3.d:0 "We have received a notification from the International Monetary Fund that our access to IMF loans has been revoked, on the basis of “not following certain criteria for members seeking loans.” While presenting a massive challenge to our fiscal and international economic situation, the Government suspects this may be a move by the IMF, and by the Western bloc as a whole, to sanction our actions in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is unclear how we should respond, other than categorically condemning this action and requesting the IMF reverse its decision. Some figures in our Government have suggested tapering back actions in Sri Lanka, as a means of appeasing the West, but others have maintained the need for self-determination on issues such as these."
 CIA_SRL.4.d:0 "As Jayamravi sat in the small restaurant, he looked around, between the door and his table, to the kitchen, and back again. As he set down the Tamil-language newspaper he was reading, he saw the two men approaching his table, nodding as they sat down. Jayamravi launched straight in.\n\n“I assume you two are here because you’re interested in the local Tiger unit?” He spoke in a hushed tone. The two nodded.\n\nLooking around, Jayamravi stood up, picking up his newspaper, leaving a few rupees on the table, and walking out into the dusty, crowded streets of Madurai, then turning suddenly into an alley, ducking into another alley, and stopping outside a doorway where a man stood. Jayamravi nodded, motioned for the two men to follow, and guided them inside, where a makeshift command center and armory seemed to have been set up.\n\n“Welcome to the local cell of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu, gentlemen. Our fighters have done checks on you and have determined that you are safe. Welcome abroad. We’re glad to have you.” Jayamravi smiled, gesturing to the tables, spread with maps, newspapers, a desk in the back with vests, explosives about to be strapped to them. Jayamravi unholstered a pistol, checking the slide. “I hope you know what you’re getting into.”\n\nWhat no one but only one realized was that “Jayamravi” was really an elaborate cover. CIA operative Shekar smiled. He missed his home, a wonderful suburbia outside of McLean, Virginia, but this mission was far more important. Much more had to be done."
 CIA_SRL.5.d:0 "SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REPORT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nMilitant activity among Tamil nationalist and militant groups has been steadily increasing in the state of Tamil Nadu, including in the major cities of Chennai, Puducherry, and Madurai. The most prominent has probably been the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a militant group almost identically based off of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nIt is not currently known of the connection between the Sri Lanka-based LTTE and the LTTN; however, it can be assumed that connections have taken place. The LTTN primarily operates as an Indian affiliate of the Tamil Tigers, designed to operate in Tamil-majority areas in an attempt to alienate popular support away from current Government assistance to the LTTE.\n\nThe current recommendation of this report is to move forward with basic counter-insurgency operations and heavier policing operations to prevent LTTN cells from committing incursions or other terrorist attacks on sovereign Indian soil. The state of Tamil Nadu should receive all adequate funding and resources necessary to achieve this task."
 CIA_SRL.6.d:0 "DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS TOWARDS INDIA\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBased on our previous assessments, this Office has indicated that instead of further destabilization operations towards India, a change in strategy is required, towards covert diplomatic actions. This office provides the following recommendations, with the cooperation of the US Embassy, New Delhi; and the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Department of State:\n\n1. Covert pressure and threatening to withhold aid, including military aid in the form of possible arms sales and technology transfers, as well as direct economic aid.\n\n2. Placing pressure on US companies operating in India, such as Union Carbide India Limited, to make similar demands, on the basis that India should cease their actions in Sri Lanka if they would like to continue to maintain economic cooperation and growth with US and other Western companies.\n\n3. Working with the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to consider placing sanctions and seizing assets of prominent Indian officials, including Cabinet officials, members of the Defense Staff, and personnel at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, on similar basis as stated above.\n\n4. Enforcement of all above sanctions and threats, as well as ensuring support from allies and other Western nations in placing pressure on the Indian Government.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that these recommendations will provide adequate diplomatic weight to persuade India to cease their operations and interference in Sri Lanka."
 CIA_SRL.7.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has come to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Inter-Services Intelligence, to request that we end aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their fight against the communist and Indian-backed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nAmerican officials are apparently focused on halting Indian influence in the region, particularly surrounding Sri Lanka, and have come to us, aware of our feelings towards India, and have asked for us to pursue more direct involvement, in order to perhaps take the Indians’ attention away from the island to the south.\n\nMembers of the Government are unsure about stopping arms shipments to the Sri Lankan Government, and some have argued that we can do both. However, we are dependent on US arms sales and other assistance, and listening to their requests may help us out in the long run."
 CIA_SRL.8.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley, and the State Department, that the Pakistani Government, including Inter-Services Intelligence, intends on continuing aid to the Sri Lankan Government in the form of arms sales and training of military personnel.\n\nWhile this is not what we asked the Pakistanis to do, and while there is some considerable anger in Langley as a result, the continued funding of the Sri Lankan Government by Pakistan still represents a beneficial opportunity to subvert Indian influence via proxy. We can only hope that their rhetoric towards India will toughen in the future."
 CIA_SRL.9.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed Langley that after confidential discussions, the Pakistani Government, under the auspices of Inter-Service Intelligence, has agreed to end covert military aid to the Sri Lankan Government in their counterinsurgency operations against Tamil rebels.\n\nBased on a request from Langley, the Pakistanis have not taken back their physical military shipments, but have stopped them in the future. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to deal with the blowback from the Sri Lankan Government, with our support.\n\nIt is hoped that with this development, we shall be able to further persuade the Pakistanis to refocus their attention on their border with India and inflaming tensions in the Kashmir region, in order to turn the Indians’ attention away from Sri Lanka and back towards their archnemesis, Pakistan."
 CIA_SRL.10.d:0 "TAMIL NADU: POSSIBILITIES FOR OPERATIONS\nStation Chief, New Delhi; Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the United States’ endeavor to assist Sri Lanka in its ongoing civil war, it has become necessary to undertake more escalatory actions in order to prevent India from becoming further involved on the side of the Tamil rebels.\n\nCIA personnel in New Delhi and Colombo have proposed expansion of operations in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which is the closest state to Sri Lanka and contains a Tamil-majority population. This Office believes that the demographic distribution presents a vital factor in committing attacks there, as it will alienate Tamil Indians away from the war, and turn regional public opinion against the Indian-backed LTTE rebels.\n\nCommitting attacks in major cities of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Madurai, using the resources of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), against particular targets such as:\n\n-Pro-war Lok Sahka members,\n-Tamil Nadu state officials,\n-The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n-Prominent social and religious leaders in the state\n\nThis will effectively attract the attention of the Indian central government, distract law enforcement and security forces, and create social divisions between members of the Tamil majority."
 CIA_SRL.11.d:0 "TAMIL NADU SECURITY REPORT\n\nPrime Minister’s Office\n\nThe security situation in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has been contentious in recent weeks. Several attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Nadu (LTTN), a Tamil nationalist militant group heavily associated with the Sri Lankan LTTE, have been perpetrated in the major metropolitan areas of Chennai and Madurai.\n\nWhile no major state or central government officials have been killed or injured, the primary targets have been local municipal officials, as well as local police and members of the Tamil Nadu Police. However, intelligence sources indicate that attacks on Lok Sakha and state officials may be incoming, if the government does not act to stop their actions.\n\nLTTN attacks, much like their comrades in Sri Lanka, have focused on suicide attacks using bombs, as well as some limited shooting attacks. Many attacks appear to be pre-planned, indicating that LTTN cells have some knowledge of government and law enforcement operations before they happen.\n\nSome officials in the government have indicated their worry for this situation, particularly as it relates to our involvement in Sri Lanka. Some whisperings have echoed about withdrawal of Indian aid to the LTTE, on the basis that their affiliate organization is waging attacks on the mainland."
 CIA_SRL.12.d:0 "ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA: SUMMARY\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe United States’ decision to support the Sri Lankan Government in its ongoing civil conflict against the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or “Tamil Tigers”) has come with significant costs and benefits to both sides. This Office recommends the following actions in addition to regular diplomatic actions, as a means of reinforcing Sri Lanka’s military capability and effectiveness, as well as halting Indian involvement in the conflict on the side of the LTTE.\n\n1. The immediate implementation of intelligence sharing with the Sri Lankan military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in addition to the Sri Lankan Police Service and other security forces. This will ensure more accurate targeting and hopeful prevention of further terrorist attacks and incursions by LTTE and other Tamil militant groups.\n\n2. Coordination of covert support (lethal and non-lethal) with Pakistan, who has also been active in aiding the Sri Lankan Government\n\n 3. Consideration of additional lethal aid support to the Sri Lankan Government, including training of the Sri Lankan Special Forces Regiment, and lethal aid to government-backed paramilitary groups, including the Muslim Home Guard.\n\nIt is our hope that a combination of this aid will augment the struggling Sri Lankan military and security forces at this present time and increase their counterinsurgency capabilities as they continue to repel attacks and offensives from the LTTE."
 CIA_SRL.13.d:0 "As the Sri Lankan Army major sat in the command headquarters, outside of Colombo, he was sweating, both from the heat and from the nervousness he felt. Assigned to command the security detail for this divisional headquarters, he looked around, into the muggy night. It was quiet, too quiet. As he stepped out of the tent, he saw the barbed wire, the entrance gate, the guard towers flanked with young soldiers, armed with their machine guns. They had been terrorized by Tiger suicide bombings, something the major had never seen before. Security was tight, but never tight enough for them, he thought.\n\nAs he walked back into the tent, he peered over the latest reports, from the local army military intelligence officers. They were remarkably short and useless, providing little to no detail on the Tigers’ activities other than that they exist and continue to commit attacks. He sighed, wondering what the point of the military intelligence corps was. Surely they had to be intelligent, right? Apparently not.\n\nOne of his lieutenants, having sped in on a motorcycle, rushed in, carrying a sheaf of papers in a file. Messily saluting, he exhaustedly pushed the papers toward the major, who opened the file and starting looking through, trying to decipher the awful Sinhalese translation.\n\n“Sir, the American operative embedded with the Military Intelligence Corps has a report on the Tigers’ movements here. He’s warning of an attack tonight, using a truck.” The major looked around, then back down, reading the report.\n\n“Okay. Raise the alert level. Double the guards. Bring up the gate barriers. Tell the troops to prepare for an incurs-” He was interrupted by the sudden rip of automatic weapons fire, seemingly from the outer perimeter, followed by shouts as troops moved towards the skirmish. The major looked out at a truck, stopped, soldiers shooting at it, then moving forward, the gunshots stopping, the driver dead. He looked at his lieutenant, then down at the sheaf of papers. “Holy shit.”"
 CIA_SRL.14.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a possible new ally in the fight for Sri Lanka. Pakistan.” CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] stood in the Oval, surrounded by Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Secretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef], and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv].\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] sat at the Resolute Desk, listening. “Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, Mr. President, the Pakistanis have been covertly funding the Sri Lankan Government since the Civil War kicked off in July of ‘83. As our reports have indicated, the Indians have been funding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil rebels that the government in Colombo is fighting. The Pakistanis have long been foes of India, and have been using this conflict as an opportunity to exercise influence in the region in order to subvert Indian goals.”\n\nThe Secretary of Defense cut in. “Specifically, the Pakistanis have been providing the Sri Lankans with small arms, some explosives, and light patrol vehicles. Their Inter-Services Intelligence service has been providing some limited intelligence, but we think that combining arms transfers from us and intelligence sharing would heavily benefit the Sri Lankans in their fight.”\n\nThe President looked around. “I see no problem with this. What are the chances the Indians find out?”\n\nThe Secretary of State responded. “Our embassy in New Delhi, as well as the CIA chief of station there, have made inquiries discreetly. The Indians have no idea and are preoccupied with tensions in Kashmir as well as funding the Tigers in Sri Lanka.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Excellent. Make it happen, gentlemen. Reach out to the Pakistanis.” The men nodded, as they shook hands, wrote some notes, and left the room to make calls."
 CIA_SRL.15.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Islamabad has informed our operatives at Inter-Services Intelligence that the United States is preparing to coordinate covert support to Sri Lanka, in the form of covert arms shipments, intelligence sharing, reconnaissance photos, and diplomatic actions.\n\nAs the US has noticed our help to the Sri Lankan Government, in their fight against Indian-backed Tamil rebels, they have decided to consolidate covert aid to maintain a united front and expand US-Pakistan cooperation. CIA and US military officials are expected to meet with ISI and Air Force officers in the coming days to work out details of a joint US-Pakistan arms shipment network, via air drops as well as cross-sea transfers via ship.\n\nIt is expected that this endeavor will be successful, with the hope that the Indians do not find out our partnership with the Americans."
 CIA_SRL.16.d:0 "FALSE FLAGS IN SRI LANKA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite the ongoing Sri Lankan Civil War, embedded CIA personnel and Sri Lankan Army personnel report a significant drop in combat effectiveness among government forces in recent weeks, out of a lack of morale and a lack of initiative among combat commanders, as well as continuing LTTE attacks on government installations and public buildings. This drop in morale is resulting in continued lack of initiative and therefore, further reduced morale.\n\nThis Office proposes the following recommendations to alleviate this issue and in particular, in ways that do not involve further advising the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, due to the lack of effectiveness with that strategy:\n\n1. Beginning covert support for isolated Tiger cells and other Sri Lankan rebel groups, with the specific mission of committing attacks against Sri Lankan government forces, under specific parameters determined by CIA operatives on the ground.\n\n2. Funding or otherwise supporting possible attacks against significant government buildings in Colombo, as well as against the residences of the Sri Lankan President, Sri Lankan Prime Minister, members of the Sri Lankan Parliament, and significant religious or social figures.\n\n3. Otherwise encouraging “false-flag” type attacks in order to provide the Sri Lankan Government with adequate justification to ramp up operations towards the LTTE forces to the north of the island.\n\nWhile no specific operations have been proposed by this Office, instead leaving that decision to be made by operatives on the ground, these should provide a basic structure to develop specific plans."
 CIA_SRL.17.d:0 "As the 2-ton truck rumbled and bounced down the road, the two drivers kept looking around, anxiously, checking the road, the sides, their rear, for figures poking out of the jungle undergrowth.\n\nThe truck had a red cross on it, indicating they were aid workers, as did their papers, but the drivers knew they were anything but. Presumably, this drive towards Mullaitivu, a town in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, would be somewhat safe, but the “aid workers” still carried concealed pistols, just in case. You could never be too careful.\n\nBouncing along, the truck stopped at what appeared to be a Tiger checkpoint. Mullaitivu was a government stronghold but the route they were taking was still contested, and that seemed clear as they got out of the truck, hands in the air, being searched by the guards, who patted them down while others stood by with Type 56 rifles. Apparently satisfied by their papers, they opened the makeshift checkpoint and the truck carried on, towards Mullaitivu, a few rupees lighter.\n\nReaching the town, the agents waved to the Sri Lankan soldiers, who looked at them warily. Arriving at the local mosque, the truck stopped, with the two men getting out and stretching for a moment before opening the back of the truck. These were certainly “aid supplies” if you considered aid to be several hundred rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The men nodded as members of the community came around, and one of them talked to the leader, apparently of the “Muslim Home Guard,” who started handing out the weapons. The other man climbed back into the truck, hitting the radio.\n\n“Eagle One to HQ. Baby birds have been fed. Distributing the “bird seed” now.”"
 CIA_SRL.18.d:0 "A dispatch from local Army commanders in Mullaitivu, a Government stronghold in the Northern Province at the front lines, has indicated that American operatives, posing as Red Cross aid workers, are arming the Muslim Home Guard, a pro-Government paramilitary group, providing them with rifles and rounds of ammunition.\n\nOur program to form more paramilitary and home defense groups in local municipalities has met with some opposition, particularly since it is hard to recruit willing civilians to defend their towns, as the attrition rate of civilians in this conflict has been particularly high.\n\nHowever, this move by the CIA has indicated that the United States intends to continue supplying both Government forces and affiliated paramilitaries, which hopefully will increase performance and capability to drive out the traitorous Tamil rebels in the north."

 # LATAM War on Drugs (Route A)
 ## Colombia
 CIA_LATAM.0.d:0 "LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe geopolitical region known as Latin America, commonly thought of as stretching from the United States’ border with Mexico, through Central and South America to the southern tip of Patagonia, has experienced intense internal and external crises and conflicts since the end of World War II, and particularly into the late 1970s and 1980s. (U/OU)\n\nUnlike other intelligence and analysis operations around the world, the Latin American region presents a unique challenge to US policymakers due to its location and current heavy American influence in the region. In particular, several issues dominate, including internal conflicts in Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua, and others. This Office has provided some recommendations for overall strategies in the region. (S)\n\n1. Maintaining the current United States policy of a strictly anti-Communist stance in the region. This may involve continuing contacts and operations in support of anti-Communist drug cartels and cocaine trafficking rings in the region, including MAS, as well as the Panamanian Government led by General Manuel Noreiga.\n\n2. Escalating the stated policy initiative known as the War on Drugs, chiefly by becoming involved in the internal conflict in Colombia, as well as increasing CIA operations on the southern border and within Mexico. This will involve more irregular operations, as well as operations in support of anti-Communist and anti-Cartel government forces in those selected regions.\n\n3. A less radical and violence approach, consisting of advocating for self-determination initiatives in the Latin American region. This would involve subtle silencing of Communist dissent, as well as ending any support for drug movements, and beginning operations against corporate influence in the region.\n\nThis Office strongly endorses all three of the above outlined strategies and is eager to begin its crucial work of securing American interests in the crucial region to its south."
 CIA_LATAMa.0.d:0 "It was a rainy morning in the Oval Office as President [USA.GetLeader] sat in the Oval, surrounded by CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, and several aides and officials from each office and agency, who were busy setting up a poster on a stand facing the desk and couches.\n\n“Mr. President, our decision to escalate the current War on Drugs campaign in Latin America has come with some challenges and benefits. However, our analysis has pointed to two large areas of focus: Colombia and Mexico.”\n\n“Colombia is currently in the middle of internal conflict which has commenced since the mid 1960’s. The two largest sides, the Government of Colombia, as well as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), have devastated much of the country and have caused regional drug cartels, such as the Cali Cartel and the Medellin Cartel, to arise in rural areas and begin their large-scale production of cocaine, which they traffick north to the United States. Operations in this area, which could consist of either covert or overt interventions, can cut the cocaine crisis off at its source.”\n\nThe President nodded. “I see. Now tell me about Mexico.”\n\n“The situation in Mexico is somewhat similar, and the relatively close location allows greater flexibility in operations. Mexico has become a prime staging point for the movement of cocaine from its manufacturing points in Colombia, and particularly from that of the Guadalajara Cartel, who has turned from trafficking through Florida to cross-border trafficking via points in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California.”\n\nThe FBI Director spoke up. “I can speak for the Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Administration that we are highly looking forward to engaging drug trafficking operations on the border and assisting the CIA in any operation they plan to deal with this terrible issue.”\n\nThe President spoke up. “Excellent, gentlemen. I’m excited to see where this goes. You all know to keep me updated, and specifically if I have to approve any operations, I expect reports daily.” The men nodded, as the poster disappeared with them, leaving the President leafing through the briefing left on his desk."
 CIA_LATAMa.1.d:0 "THE COLOMBIAN CONFLICT: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nHaving gone on since 1964, the Colombian conflict has had its roots in a period of repression known as La Violencia, having occurred from 1948 to 1964, where left-wing and right-wing groups consistently clashed. Now, in the 1980s, the Colombian conflict has reached new heights, with multiple belligerents and the addition of drug cartels and other paramilitary groups becoming involved. (S)\n\nThe major players in the conflict include the anti-Communist Government of Colombia, including the police and military, which is supported by most friendly anti-Communist countries in Latin America as well as the United States. The major insurgent groups include the Communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia People’s Army (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), the urban-based 19th of April Movement (M-19), most of whom are left-wing groups supported and assisted by the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, and other Socialist countries. (S)\n\nThe conflict has been further complicated by the large Colombian cocaine production and distribution capability which, in the midst of this civil conflict, has been co-opted by strong and well-armed drug cartels; the most infamous being the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel, and MAS. These groups are typically anti-Communist, but remain ideologically neutral, instead focusing on profits and preventing government enforcement of the law. (S)\n\nIt is in this environment that the United States is challenged to respond. This Office hereby recommends both covert and overt proposals for operations, recognizing that the former may guarantee plausible deniability, but that the latter may increase efficiency of anti-drug operations overall."
 CIA_LATAMa.2.d:0 "OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA: PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nColombia Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations\n\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nWhile it is clear that the United States should ally itself with the Government of Colombia in the ongoing conflict, expanding operations against both Communist guerrilla groups, as well as drug cartels, such as the Medellin Cartel, would ensure continuing US influence in Colombia and destroy any capability for cocaine production and trafficking into the United States.\n\n1. Offensive operations should primarily be conducted against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Formed in 1964 as a result of government attacks on Communist militias, FARC is the single largest Communist paramilitary group in Colombia, and has spread out over primarily rural areas in cells throughout the country. This Office recommends embedding in local FARC cells, committing attacks against FARC units in the form of bombings and targeted assassinations of officials, in order to stoke internal dissent and prevent the organization from achieving its goal of unifying to present a conventional threat to Colombian regular forces.\n\n2. Additional supporting operations should be directed towards the Alianza Americana Anticomunista (American Anticommunist Alliance, or AAA), which is a right-wing, anti-Communist paramilitary group associated with Colombian military intelligence. Operating in support of regular Colombian National Army forces, the AAA has been implicated in a 1978 bombing of the Colombian Communist Party’s headquarters, as well as their newspaper. CIA assistance would involve arms shipments of small arms, advisors, and possible intelligence sharing.\n\n3. Lastly, the destruction of coca fields should also be accomplished. This strategy, including burning fields, cutting plants, or spraying plots from airplane using chemicals. CIA forces, supplemented by Colombian Air Force units, should be able to accomplish these operations, which are designed to eliminate drug cartel operations in Colombia and prevent funding to be provided to FARC and other Communist militias.\n\nSpecific proposals on each operation should be delegated to Colombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Operations, and should be cleared with the Directorate for Analysis and the Director before being forwarded to Special Activities Division."
 CIA_LATAMa.3.d:0 "“Mr. President, the CIA Director has some news on Colombia.”\n“Send him in, and thank you.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] smiled, shaking hands with [GetCurrentCIADir] as they sat down at the Resolute desk, the Director pulling out a file from his briefcase and laying it on the table.\n\n“Mr. President, with your approval, the CIA would like to begin extended operations against the FARC in Colombia.”\n\n“Very well. Update me on who FARC is again.”\n\n“Mr. President, FARC is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. They are a Communist guerrilla group currently fighting the Government of Colombia, whom we back. We intend on expanding offensive operations against them by providing further funding and support to the Government of Colombia, as well as escalating covert actions such as embedding agents into FARC cells and conducting targeted assassinations of FARC leaders and prominent figures to cause dissent in the movement.”\n\n“Very well. What is the CIA's prediction of these operations being successful?”\n\n“Very high, Mr. President. We hope that in particular with the assassinations, FARC will become internally divided and may split into warring factions which the Colombian Government will be better equipped to handle. As well, the CIA plans on cooperating with the government on a nationwide anti-FARC campaign in order to show the damage and destruction they have caused to the people of Colombia.”\n\n“Good, Director. This is approved. Please keep me updated on all events.” The President signed a piece of paper, as the Director smiled, placing his file back into his briefcase and preparing to leave. “Thank you, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.4.d:0 "As Jimmy banked the Air Tractor AT-301 slightly, he yawned, rubbing his eyes as he checked the compass and the map laying in his lap to confirm his heading. He had just passed over the small city of Pasto, in the southwestern Narino Department of Colombia, and as his turboprop winged above the mountains at 10,000 feet, he felt lonely.\n\nIt was approximately two in the morning, Bogota time, and as Jimmy continued to fly, he re-checked his tank indicator gauge, making sure that the tank was full of glyphosate herbicide, as well as dropping altitude to approach his series of targets; three coca fields, spaced roughly a klick or two apart, in the Patia valley.\n\nSquinting to make out the first one, Jimmy smiled as he saw a flashing light, pointing out his forward air controller squad, code-named “AGUILA”, who was tasked with distracting the cartel men and signaling the sprayer plane. Jimmy heard some automatic weapons fire as he began his pass, unsure whether it was AGUILA or the Medellin men. He smiled and waved at nobody as he dropped to 200 feet, punching the “drop” button to let loose some 100 gallons of herbicide into a fine mist over the coca plants, before pulling back up to a safe altitude, to do it two more times.\n\nAs he completed his last run, pulling to 10,000 feet once again, Jimmy was reminded of his first days as a crop duster in the Midwest, flying routine spraying missions, when he was stopped by a CIA recruiter. “How would you like to do some work for us down south, son?”"
 CIA_LATAMa.5.d:0 "As President [USA.GetLeader] walked back into the Oval after a short break between meetings, he was nonetheless surprised to see further charts being set up on tripods near his desk, and aides fluttering about, handing out folders and packets.\n\n“Mr. President, we believe that the situation in the Colombian conflict has deteriorated to such a degree that US intervention is necessary to support our goals and the goals of the Colombian Government.” National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] spoke up first, breaking the silence in the room.\n\nCIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] spoke up next. “Sir, our embedded operatives have strongly urged more offensive operations. The Colombian Government is fumbling, and is struggling to contain both FARC and the other Communist militia groups, as well as multiple drug cartels that are competing for influence and ability to distribute cocaine. Our operations can help, but can only go so far.”\n\nSecretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef] nodded. “We have begun implementing and adjusting contingency operations for Colombia. State can tell you more, but the Pentagon has tasked US Southern Command to take primary control of military operations. Preliminary recommendations include the use of air strikes and intelligence sharing against FARC forces, in order to allow Colombian forces to engage Cartel groups.”\n\nThe President finally found a chance to speak up. “Give me the diplomatic angle before I clear any military action. This situation is complicated enough as it is.”\n\nSecretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] broke in. “Our diplomatic relations with the Colombians have been cordial and effective. Our Ambassador in Bogota reports that US military and political assistance to Colombia has been successful thus far, but that the military faces a large corruption problem. He recommends dealing with that by halting some aid in exchange for reforms.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Very well. Thank you all, folks. Keep me updated, and I want regularly updated reports and plans from the Pentagon and Joint Chiefs. Nothing military-oriented happens without my signoff.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.6.d:0 "Based on a rather threatening request by the American Ambassador, our top generals have instituted an anti-corruption initiative within the Military Forces of Colombia. Presumably as a part of pressure initiated by the Americans, who have been providing millions of dollars worth of aid and advising, the top military commanders have created an “Anti-Corruption Unit” which will go about investigating petty and major corruption, particularly among officers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nIt is hoped that this will go somewhere, as the commanders have pressure to maintain it and allow the unit some autonomy, as it will report both to the Colombian General Staff and the President, as well as issue some limited reports to the American Embassy in Bogota."
 CIA_LATAMa.7.d:0 "“Hello?”\n“Secretary, this is Embassy Bogota. The Ambassador would like a word.” The phone clicked as the line changed to the US Ambassador to Colombia.“Secretary, hope you’re doing well this morning.”\n“Yes, Ambassador, I am. What’s this about?”\n“The Colombians have asked that we get further involved in the conflict, besides our current policy of providing overt military assistance in the form of assets and advisors. I’m hesitant to call the Pentagon as our Defense Attache really wants them to deploy troops and I don’t want to escalate.”\n“Very well, Ambassador, thank you. What do we suggest that State does in the meantime, in order to possibly hold off the Pentagon and USSOUTHCOM?”\n\n“Secretary, I think we should designate FARC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization; you have authority to designate groups under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. We then make multiple statements; I make one, you make one, the Pentagon makes one. It looks like we have a united front, we don’t necessarily have to have POTUS’s permission, but we can read him in. It would be “symbolically” declaring war on FARC without pushing it through the Oval Office or the Hill.”\n\n“And the Colombians?” The Secretary frowned into the phone.\n“They won’t know the difference. All they’ll hear is “declare war” and take it literally, and then the Pentagon can start deploying small numbers of troops to Colombia from Panama or Florida.”\n“Okay. Thank you Ambassador, I appreciate your forwardness. I’ll consult with staff and we’ll move on this as soon as possible. Thanks again. Goodbye.”\n\nHe put down the phone, sighing but thinking about what he had just heard. A genius idea."
 CIA_LATAMa.8.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, simultaneous statements from Foggy Bottom and the Pentagon were released today, as the United States Secretary of State officially listed the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In tandem, the Pentagon announced further defensive aid for the Colombian government in its fight against FARC, as well as sending further assets, advisors, and units of the United States Southern Command to task in Colombia. Facing normal praise in the West and criticism in the East, Colombia has welcomed this announcement as tacit American involvement in the conflict."

Units and detachments of the 24th Composite Wing, based from Howard Air Force Base in Panama, are authorized to engage all installations and headquarters of the Medellin and Cali Cartels in southwestern Colombia. The 24th Composite Wing Commander is authorized to use all available aircraft, including but not limited to A-7 Corsairs, C-130 Hercules, O-2 Skymasters, and UH-1 Huey helicopters.\n\n2. Units of United States Navy Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2), based on USS Ranger (CV-61); including Fighter Squadrons 1 and 2, Attack Squadrons 25, 113, and 145 armed with A-6E Intruders and F-14 Tomcats, are authorized for similar strikes on Medellin and Cali cartel installations on the western coast of Colombia, in cooperation with Air Force flights.\n\n3. Support units of Joint Task Force Bravo, stationed in Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras, along with all other support units from USAF Southern Air Division and Carrier Air Wing Two, are authorized to provide airfield and aircraft maintenance, weapons handling, target verification, and other support services.\n\nAll USN and USAF Commanders will independently select and verify target lists based on CIA and DIA intelligence reports and embedded personnel.

 CIA_LATAMa.10.d:0 "Today, a Department of Defense spokesman at the Pentagon announced the official expansion of US air operations in Colombia against major drug cartels in the region. Designating United States Southern Command, based in Doral, Florida, as the primary command for these operations, the Pentagon stated the reason for these strikes was to “protect American interests and partners in Latin America, ensure the end of cocaine trafficking in the region, and to assist the Military Forces of Colombia in their ongoing counterinsurgency mission.”\n\nAccording to further briefings from US Southern Command spokesmen, units involved include the 24th Composite Wing of the United States Air Force based out of Panama, as well as squadrons based from the USS Ranger carrier group, which intends to operate off the coast of Colombia. Reactions to this have been mixed, but the messaging has primarily been of assistance to the Colombian government, and of counter-drug enforcement operations which serve to assist all parties, regardless of ideology."
 CIA_LATAMa.11.d:0 "FARC INTELLIGENCE REPORT FNSJBFB-NN\n[GetDateText]\n\nThe latest intelligence from our cells, spread out throughout the country, have indicated the following information, specifically about expanded American air operations against our targets and Cartel targets.\n\nCells have reported spotting several types of American aircraft, including A-6 Intruders, A-7 Corsairs, C-130 cargo aircraft, and many UH-1 Huey gunships and utility helicopters. The presence of A-6 fighter aircraft, which are carrier-capable, suggests that the Americans are running some operations from a carrier group off the Colombian coast. The other aircraft appear to either be based from somewhere in Panama, or local aircraft stationed at Colombian military bases.\n\nFARC and friendly militia installations and camps have generally not been targeted by American forces, although a few cells have been affected by collateral damage or have lost weapons caches and vehicles. The Americans appear to be attacking Cartel positions, focusing on the Medellin and Cali Cartels who operate in western and southern Colombia, as their focus appears to be counter-drug enforcement operations, as opposed to standard counterinsurgency operations, against a force such as ours.\n\nSome regional leaders have expressed concern that these ongoing American operations will allow the Colombian regular forces to concentrate on FARC units, as well as deny our organization crucial funds required to keep the fight going. However, our capability remains high and we will persevere despite these imperialists bombing our land."
 CIA_LATAMa.12.d:0 "The analysts sat around the table, sipping coffee and waiting as CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] came in, only a short step from his office on the 7th floor of the Original Headquarters Building, at Langley.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen.” The Director smiled and shut the door. “Let’s get right into it. Tell me everything you know about Pablo Escobar.”\n\n“Yes, Director. His full name is Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria. Born December 1949, raised in the city of Medellin, in northwestern Colombia. Heavily involved in criminal enterprises since he was a teenager, including stealing cars and kidnapping of businessmen. First arrested in 1976 by the Colombian Security Service for trafficking cocaine from Ecuador. Escobar began to assert his influence, turning to bribery and assassination of officials, hiring gunmen and trafficking ever-increasing amounts of cocaine out of Colombia, and north into the United States, initially through Miami and the Bahamas.”\n\n“The corresponding cocaine boom in the early part of this decade has only increased demand for cocaine from Colombia, and has increased competition between Escobar’s Medellin Cartel, and their rival, the Cali Cartel. However, Escobar and his men appear to be caught in the middle. They oppose both the Colombian Government who wants to restore security, while also opposing FARC and remaining against Communist interference. According to Ops, CIA has tried to contact Escobar to seek cooperation, but has thus far failed. The Agency must come to a decision on what to do with him, and fast.”\n\n“Thank you, gentlemen. I see. Are you proposing we take out Escobar and his lieutenants?”\n“Yes, sir. DEA, understandably, and FBI are all over this idea; but they don’t have the resources or pull to make it work themselves. They know the CIA has the influence and funding, and we’ve done assassinations successfully in the past.”\n“So what’s the plan?”\n\n“Ops has proposed tracking Escobar’s movements for the next few weeks to establish a pattern of analysis as to where he and his lieutenants go; alternating between his home city of Medellin, and various homes that he owns in Cartagena, Colombia, and one in Miami. It may be that he lets down his guard enough to take a weekend off and that’s when we strike. Operatives from CIA, DEA, MACV-SOG, et cetera, will organize a strike proposal option, likely at his property at Cartagena, where we take Escobar, preferably alive, but dead will work as well.”\n\n“Very well. We will not read the President on this unless absolutely necessary.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.13.d:0 "USE OF ANTI-COMMUNIST CARTELS IN COLOMBIA\nColombia Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe situation of drug trafficking cartels in Colombia has presented an unusual situation for all involved parties, including the United States, in protecting US interests. While most cartels maintain an anti-communist ideology in the frame of expanding profit margins for their cocaine trafficking operations, they also must contend with continual interference and attacks from the Colombian Government, as well as share some practical ideals with Communist militias and other groups.\n\nIt is the opinion of this Office that certain large non-Communist cartel groups, such as the Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar, should be co-opted and folded into a general, government led, anti-communist alliance. This Office believes that the Cartels already have the money, distribution networks, and weapons required to combat FARC and other Communist militias, and if we are able to make deals with major cartels (on issues such as cocaine distribution and/or immunity from prosecution) we may be able to receive further Cartel aid and reduce the number of belligerents in the conflict. Consolidation must be key."
 ## Mexico
 CIA_LATAMa.14.d:0 "SITUATION UPDATE: MEXICO DESK\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite other conflicts and tumult occurring in the majority of the Latin American world, the US neighbor to the south, Mexico, is facing a unique situation as well. While maintaining rather cordial relations with the United States, Mexico is single-handedly responsible for the transshipment of over 50% of US imports of marijuana and heroin, both Schedule I controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nThe Mexican Government, led by President [MEX.GetLeader] is facing similar drug control problems as do nations further south, such as Colombia. Use of herbicide spraying and involvement of the Mexican Armed Forces in drug enforcement operations has proven unsuccessful, as the country remains a central point for both production of marijuana and heroin, as well as a staging point for trafficking of cocaine from other states, including Colombia. However, it is worth noting that unlike other Latin American drug-producing states, the Mexican population consumes very little of the drugs that it produces and trafficks.\n\nUnited States policy until now has been to force diplomatic pressure on the Mexican government to adopt more stringent control measures, which it has done most of the time, with varying degrees of effectiveness. This Office, along with other Mexican-focused offices and desks of the intelligence community and State Department, has proposed two possible changes in strategy to assist Mexico in its ongoing drug problem, and to advance American interests in the region.\n\n1. The United States could begin a covert approach to Mexico, operating to engage cartels without the knowledge of the Mexican government. This may be preferable instead of attempting to diplomatically pressure the Mexicans, and potential operations might include training of anti-Cartel militias, covert assaults on Cartel bases and installations, and an increase of DEA operations and funding.\n\n2. American policymakers might also consider a possible intervention in Mexico in order to forcefully stabilize the situation. It is hoped that this would be an international intervention and may involve a United Nations process. It is imperative that the Mexican government be consulted in this, in order to maintain friendly relations with Mexico and ensure no ill will. If Mexico is willing to accept international observers and aid, they will be better equipped to handle the drug issue.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that one of the two strategies will properly align the United States toward a path of good drug enforcement and adequately stabilize the drug situation in Latin and Central America."
 CIA_LATAMa.15.d:0 "COVERT APPROACHES IN MEXICO\nMexico Desk, Latin America Desk, Directorate of Analysis, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs relations between the United States and Mexico have deteriorated, the US intelligence community and State Department has determined that a covert strategy in the ongoing drug war is the next step in American policy as concerns Mexico and drug enforcement operations. This Office recommends the following:\n\n1. Training anti-Cartel militia units, also known as autonomous self-units, in municipalities and cities, specifically where Cartel activity is known to be high. The purpose of this is to train local Mexican citizens to defend their communities and to provide local autonomy in anti-Cartel operations, devolving authority to local governments.\n\n2. Conducting special forces raids on Cartel bases and installations; using resources of CIA, DIA, Delta Force, and SEALs, strategically attacking, raiding, arresting, and killing Cartel leaders and lieutenants, as well as delivery drivers and convoys, in order to interdict and send a message to Cartels that the US means business.\n\n3. Expansion of DEA border funding, as well as Border Patrol resources. This funding, pulled from already-appropriated CIA funding, would provide DEA and Border Patrol resources to continue to interdict and arrest Cartel members and drug trafficking through the US border and ports of entry, as well as approving additional jurisdictional powers for those agencies to continue their operations.\n\nIt is this Office’s hope that further covert operations and cooperation with relevant US and Mexican agencies and officials will effectively interdict drug manufacturing and trafficking in Mexico, thereby stopping the flow of drugs into the southern United States and protecting our security at home and abroad."
 CIA_LATAMa.17.d:0 "It was dusk in the desert, and as the sun slipped below the horizon, the hot temperatures quickly began to cool. Thank god for that, Mason thought as he sipped on a bottle of water, waiting for it to get darker. He was sitting in a Ford Econovan, with Mexican plates of course.\n\n“Hey Gene, how’s it looking back there?”\n\nGene, his partner operative, nodded. “Looking good, boss!” He checked the hastily equipped surveillance equipment again, before loading the last bullet into his SIG Sauer P220 pistol, sliding the other loaded one across the floor to Pickett.\n\nThe radio crackled to life again, indicating the near presence of the assault team. “Overwatch, this is Dog One. Dog One, approaching LZ. Situation report, come on!”\n\nGene picked back up. “Dog One, this is Overwatch. Target Alpha all clear. Cleared to storm. Storm, storm, storm.”\n\nJust as he had finished, three Hughes 500D helicopters shot over the van, about 50 feet above them, coming to a landing inside the courtyard of the Cartel compound. Five soldiers, clinging to each chopper, jumped off, taking tactical positions, as the choppers lifted back off, providing covering fire from the air.\n\nGene and Mason moved out of their position as well, as the van pulled forward from its hidden position and stopped, fishtailing outside the entrance. The two CIA agents, rushing towards the courtyard, fought their way to the DEA assault team, who were busy laying fire down, arresting surrendering Cartel members, and inspecting the bodies of the handful they had killed on the way down.\n\n“Looks like we struck at the perfect time.” Mason said, taking a second to reload his pistol before moving to clear another room."
 CIA_LATAMa.18.d:0 "It was a cloudy morning in Washington as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency walked into the DEA headquarters building, located at 1405 I Street, only blocks from the White House and National Mall. As he got upstairs, to the top floor, entering his office, there was a note on his desk from his secretary, something about a call to his office from an unknown number, asking to speak to him. Most calls were screened, but this was from a government phone.\n\nGetting to work on some reports, the phone rang about 20 minutes later. He picked it up, expecting any number of people on the other end; his wife, a subordinate, et cetera.\n\n“Hello?”\n“Is this the DEA Administrator?”\n“Yes, to whom am I speaking?”\n“This is Langley. Check your operating budget accounts. There should be some new funds in there, in the neighborhood of $20 million. You’re welcome.”\n“What?”\nClick.\n\nThe DEA Administrator just looked around, before setting the receiver down. What the hell, he thought. More money to do drug interdiction programs, I guess, he thought a second later."
 CIA_LATAMa.19.d:0 "“Mr. President, we have a proposal on a solution to the Mexico issue.”\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] paused from whatever business he had been attending to before, surely something less important than whatever was going to emerge from CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir]’s mouth. The Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState] was standing behind him, so that had to mean something.\n\n“Go on, Director.”\n\n“Well, sir, the CIA has run an analysis of the situation in Mexico, US policy, and they’ve come up with an alternative to what we’re doing now. We propose an international intervention, either led by the United States or the United Nations, into Mexico, in order to stabilize the internal situation as well as provide crucial counter-drug and interdiction operational capabilities.”\n\n“I see. Do we plan to read the Mexicans in on this, Secretary?”\n\nThe Secretary of State nodded. “Yes, sir. We plan to make an announcement as well as an inquiry through the US Ambassador in Mexico City, with their options being that we will provide them aid and training, or if they refuse, we will attempt to find an international consensus via the United Nations and Organization of American States.”\n\n“I see. Consider this signed off, gentlemen. I presume the other alternative was to continue covert operations in Mexico?”\n“Yes, sir. We had considered that, but seeing as our relations with the Mexicans appear to be good right now, the diplomatic option may be preferable.”\n“Very well. Thank you, gentlemen.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President.” The two men exited out of the Oval, and glancing at each other, stood in the corridor for a minute. “Secretary, I hope you know what you’re getting into. Might want to get international support now while you can.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.20.d:0 "The US Ambassador to Mexico has come to our Secretariat of Foreign Affairs and Secretariat of Defense with a proposal to combat our ongoing drug enforcement problem in the country.\n\nThe White House, apparently concerned with our ineffectiveness in combating Cartel drug production and trafficking operations in Mexico, has proposed an international intervention in Mexico in order to stabilize the situation and to allow for assistance to the government to improve the enforcement.\n\nThe Americans have offered international law enforcement aid in the form of funding as well as cross-border cooperation in interdiction, but some officials within the government are concerned that allowing the Americans to dictate drug policy in their own country is invasive and counterproductive to political goals. However, the US Ambassador made clear that all in all, the US will get involved, like it or not. A crucial decision must be made, whether to enlist their help or to stand firm against Yankee domination over our affairs."
 CIA_LATAMa.21.d:0 "After a short conference with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington, indicating that the Mexican Government is open to American aid with drug enforcement operations.\n\nApparently seen as a quite controversial topic in some corners of Mexican political life, the issue was seen as a net benefit, and already, American DEA and Mexican Federal Police have met to discuss border cooperation and possible operations. Intelligence sharing is also expected to take place, and the Pentagon has already floated deploying some military advisors and security personnel to assist with the Mexican Secretariat for Defense.\n\nLatin American analysts have expressed optimism for the future, hoping that further US-Mexican cooperation will stop major Cartels from continuing their influence in Mexican politics, and halt the rapidly increasing drug problem in the United States."
 CIA_LATAMa.22.d:0 "After a terse meeting with Mexican diplomatic and national security officials, the US Ambassador in Mexico City has reported back to Washington that the Mexicans are staunchly against an American intervention or assistance in their country, on the grounds that further American influence in their country will continue to erode the political and social situation as well as continue the ongoing drug problem.\n\nThe Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs has included a public statement, revealing the plan, harshly condemning the request as “a nicely framed tactic of American imperialism in Latin America,” and that “Mexico will not be co-opted for American interests further south. We can deal with the ongoing drug trafficking problem ourselves without US or international interference.”\n\nOfficials in the intelligence and defense communities have reportedly been furious, along with President [USA.GetLeader] being briefed about the ongoing developments. It is clear that if the Mexicans will not comply, we will make them comply by all means necessary; even if it means turning to the international community."
 CIA_LATAMa.23.d:0 "In Mexico City today, a spokesman for the Mexican Secretariat for Foreign Affairs confirmed the previously unsubstantiated reports that the United States was seeking an intervention in Mexico against the ongoing drug cartel crisis. Mexican officials unequivocally condemned any possible intervention as “American imperialism in Latin America, the likes of which have been seen before in Brazil, Guatemala, and Cuba.”\n\nAmerican officials are reportedly disappointed by this development, but have vowed to continue on with a possible intervention. Some pundits have posited that the United Nations, or the Organization for American States may be contacted, but time will tell."
 CIA_LATAMa.24.d:0 "It was a sunny day as President [USA.GetLeader] gathered with his staff and subordinates for a small but formal ceremony. Gathered were the Secretary of State, [GetCurrentSecState], CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], the Director of the FBI, the DEA Administrator, and the Chief of the Border Patrol.\n\nThey were all assembled there, no press, yet, because the President was signing an important, yet somewhat archaic and traditional, document; a presidential proclamation. But this was no ordinary proclamation; one that would also be accompanied by a joint resolution of Congress confirming its contents; a presidential proclamation declaring the United Mexican States to be a narco state, a country operating around the business of producing and trafficking drugs.\n\n“By the authority invested in me as President of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim the following:\nBecoming more rapidly concerned over increased flows of marijuana and heroin into the United States via its border with Mexico;\nConcerned that Mexican law enforcement and military units are not effective nor capable of engaging in the Cartels on their own;\nRecognizing the integral role that corruption, particularly of Cartel influence, in the Mexican political system plays in the above effectiveness of law enforcement in drug interdiction operations;\nI, as President of the United States of America, declare and proclaim that the United Mexican States is now considered a narco state under the above facts, and issues all warnings to civilians via relevant sources, such as the Department of State, of the dangers of traveling to Mexico for their own safety.”\n\nThe President sighed as he signed his name to the proclamation, knowing full well that this would only be the beginning to what was surely going to be an interesting situation for his administration."
 CIA_LATAMa.25.d:0 "As Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] sat in his office, he checked his schedule, before hearing a buzz from his outside secretary.\n“Secretary, you have calls from Ambassadors and Latin America Desk on lines one through four.”\n\nPicking up the phone, he hit “LINE 1”.\n\n“Good morning Ambassador, how are you? What’s the situation in London?”\n“Secretary, the British seem ambivalent about supporting an international drug enforcement mission. They have little influence or reason to get involved in Mexico, but the Foreign Secretary didn’t indicate that they’d vote against it.”\n\n“Very good, thanks Ambassador. Have a good day.” The Secretary murmured a goodbye before hitting “LINE 2”.\n“Ambassador, how is it looking in Paris?”\n“Secretary, the French are interested in contributing to a drug monitoring mission. They said they won’t vote against it in the Security Council.”\n“Very good, thanks.” The Secretary tersely switched to “LINE 3”.\n\n“Secretary, I know what you’re going to ask. The Brazilians, Argentinians, and Chileans are all in support of your program. The Colombians might be, but as you know they’re bogged down at the moment. Most of Central America is also in support except for Nicaragua, of course.”\n\n“Thank you, Latin America Desk. Keep your analyses going. Have a good day.” The Secretary felt bad but he had to keep this short, switching to his last call, “LINE 4,” the Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n“Mr. Ambassador, how is your work going in New York?”\n\n“Secretary, it’s been mixed. The Mission and I have been working around the clock to contact the other Missions here and get them on board, particularly the Security Council members and the Eastern Bloc, but very little luck so far. Many members outside of Latin America either do not care or consider it further US imperialism. We are trying our best, Secretary, and are working on language for a draft resolution right now.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Keep up your good work and keep up the reports. If you need a call from me, patch it through my office. The President wants this to happen and god damn it, I’m going to try to make this work.”"
 CIA_LATAMa.26.d:0 "It was the regular meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and as the members entered the meeting room of the Council in New York, they began to suspect a trap. The American representative, having already arrived, was going over papers, aides standing nearby. They looked up as the Soviet, Chinese, British, French, and non-permanent representatives sat down, being gaveled into order by the chair. Typically, the American Ambassador stood up first, launching immediately into their speech.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen of the Security Council, today I called a meeting to discuss an issue which the United Nations has dealt with before. Our neighbor to the south, Mexico, has had a continual drug enforcement problem, with multiple large cartels producing and trafficking marijuana and heroin across the border into the United States. This is affecting our youth, causing hundreds of deaths and addiction on both sides of the border, and providing organized crime with millions of dollars for their own uses.”\n\n“The Mexican government has attempted to use their law enforcement and military sources to counter these cartels but has been ineffective in this goal. The United States has tried to request to help, but the Mexican government has resisted our advances at every turn. This is an issue which not only affects us, but the entire Latin American region, if not the entire world. The War on Drugs is an international issue, and one that we, as a global leader, want to solve, with the assistance of the UN.”\n\n“As the American representative to the United Nations Security Council, I hereby place the following resolution onto the table, to condemn the drug crisis in Mexico, authorize a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and authorize the United States to take action to restore the rule of law in Mexico and eliminate drug trafficking operations.”\n\nSitting back down, the entire room erupted in a low murmur. As the American delegation sat in their corner of the room, they knew that this would only be the beginning."
 CIA_LATAMa.27.d:0 "Surprise at the United Nations in New York came today as the United States Permanent Representative on the Security Council approached the body and submitted a draft resolution concerning the ongoing drug crisis in the region.\n\nSubmitted days after the Mexican Government denied an offer for intervention to prevent drug trafficking, as well as US President [USA.GetLeader] declaring Mexico as a narco-state in a presidential proclamation, the draft UNSC resolution firmly condemns the ongoing drug crisis and Mexico’s ineffectiveness in stopping it, authorizing a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, and placing that Mission under the leadership of the United States to restore the rule of law in Mexico and combat drug trafficking.\n\nWidely seen as an international example of the United States’ ongoing policy of the “War on Drugs,” the Security Council is widely divided on this; with the Soviet delegation and others condemning such blatant messaging but also not indicating any vetoes. Much of the non-Communist Latin American states appear supportive, with the obvious absence of Mexico."
 CIA_LATAMa.28.d:0 "Good news has arrived from our Permanent Representative to the United Nations today, as they have confirmed that the Security Council has approved our draft resolution on the Mexico issue.\n\nUnder consultation from the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the UN resolution stipulates the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico, managed under the command of the United States and other participating countries. The resolution also firmly condemned the Mexican government for their ineffectiveness thus far in preventing drug trafficking.\n\nOfficials in Foggy Bottom, the Pentagon, and New York are quickly coordinating to establish a group of participating countries, as well as pre-positioning military assets near the Mexican border to begin the operation once it is formed by the UN."
 CIA_LATAMa.29.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from United Nations Headquarters in New York City, as the United Nations Security Council, acting under the influence and sway of the United States, passed a resolution authorizing the formation of a United Nations Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico.\n\nApparently displeased with our government’s effectiveness thus far in combating the drug crisis, the UN has granted American forces permission to lead the Mission, with international personnel and support from the region and around the world.\n\nMany within the government, including President [MEX.GetLeader] are very displeased, and are urging any and all resistance to UN and American forces. Time will tell what the Mission does, how it operates with this crisis, and how we will respond"
 CIA_LATAMa.30.d:0 "Further surprise from United Nations Headquarters in New York City came as the United Nations Security Council, led by the United States, approved a draft resolution authorizing a UN Monitoring and Enforcement Mission in Mexico. Apparently recognizing the need for international drug control and enforcement, all five Permanent Members of the Security Council agreed on the issue, with no vetoes, even from the Soviet Union.\n\nPlacing the United States as primarily in charge of the Mission, it is expected that operations in Mexico will begin shortly. International support, both within the Security Council and in the General Assembly, will be required to receive more volunteers and enforcement personnel. Mexico, while not having officially commented, has had major government officials express extreme disapproval, and it is expected that Mexican government interference in Mission operations will occur on almost all issues."
 CIA_LATAMa.31.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from UN Headquarters in New York today, with our Ambassador to the United Nations calling the White House and informing [USA.GetLeader] that the Security Council resolution regarding Mexico has failed, with a veto by the Soviet Union, effectively ending any meaningful proposals the US had.\n\nState and Defense Department officials are reportedly furious, with members of the UN delegation in New York attempting to gain some traction in the General Assembly for a draft resolution there. However, any chance of a UN monitoring mission in Mexico has failed, due to Eastern Bloc interference and influence."
 CIA_LATAMa.32.d:0 "Good news has arrived from the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations, that a proposed draft resolution in the Security Council forming a UN Monitoring Mission in our country has failed, due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nSenior government officials are reportedly pleased, while diplomatic sources in the United States report that many State Department and White House officials are furious, and may be turning to contingencies to achieve their goals. It is still not known what the United States will do to continue this issue, but we can at least be safe from an international intervention for now."
 CIA_LATAMa.33.d:0 "More news has come from UN Headquarters in New York today as the United Nations Security Council rejected a US-authored resolution to form an international monitoring and enforcement force in Mexico to control the ongoing drug crisis there. According to UN officials, the resolution failed due to a veto by the Soviet Union, one of the five Permanent Members of the Council.\n\nWhile Mexican officials are reported as being relieved by this development, American officials are furious, particularly after they had mounted a campaign of international support for drug enforcement operations. It is not immediately clear if the US will act alone to solve the issue, but only time will tell."

 # LATAM Anti-Communist Priority (Route B)
 CIA_LATAMb.0.d:0 "It was a rainy Monday morning in the Oval Office, and as the President settled in with his cup of coffee, he prepared for yet another exciting briefing from his core group of national security staff; CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], and Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], along with a flurry of aides.\n\n“Mr. President, I’m sure that you’d agree that right now, our best course of action is to maintain an anti-Communist priority in the Latin American region.  Focusing on the cartels will not get us anywhere in the region, as the United States and allies would be focused on fighting groups from both sides. While the cartels are dangerous, Communist guerillas in Central and Latin America are even more dangerous, and have the institutional capacity to overthrow US-supported governments. It is our opinion that this should be the number one priority in the region.” The National Security Advisor opened up.\n\n“Very well then. Director, what does CIA propose to do to support intelligence efforts as a part of this plan?”\n\nThe CIA Director looked through some notes then spoke. “Mr. President, the CIA has primarily concentrated its proposals and analysis on Panama. The leader there, General Manuel Noriega, has been trained at the School of the Americas, is a strong anti-communist, and previously served as head of intelligence for Panama before he became leader. We believe he and his government will be a crucial asset in the region. As well, our focus on drug trafficking has primarily looked at cocaine, and possibly trafficking it to fund further operations against the Communists.”\n\nThe Secretary of State broke in before the President could respond. “Mr. President, as well, State has looked into expanding relations with anti-Communist Central American states such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. State has determined that possible inducements could be arms sales, economic aid, trade relation normalization, et cetera, if they continue to support intervention against Communist guerillas.”\n\nThe President nodded, setting down his cup. “This sounds like a good, well-coordinated plan. My only concern is how public we should go. CIA operations should stay covert, while diplomatic actions remain public. We do not brief Congress on this unless they ask, understood?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.1.d:0 "“What is this general’s name again?”\n“General Manuel Noriega, Deputy Director.”\n\nThe two analysts, having spent days preparing reports on Latin America, were seething at the proposition of having to simplify every bit of information for the CIA Deputy Director for Operations, as they sat in a conference room somewhere in Langley.\n\n“Okay. Noriega. What about him? What does the Latin America Desk have on him?”\n\n“Born in 1934, joined the Panamanian National Guard in the 1960s, was educated at the School of the Americas in 1966, was posted to anti-union operations for the United Fruit Company. Noriega rose through the Panamanian military, supporting Torrijos’s claim to power, and became his head of intelligence. During that time, he exiled over a thousand Panamanians that he deemed dissidents and became involved with narcotics trafficking; American law enforcement picked up on this in the 1970s but let it lie. In 1971, relations between Panama and the United States, particularly on intelligence, had become close enough that CIA placed Noriega on the payroll, and since then CIA has paid him about $100,000 to almost $200,000 a year, depending on the administration and budgetary priorities. Noriega is now the leader of Panama, succeeding Omar Torrijos when he died in 1981.”\n\n“Excellent, thank you.” The DDO paused for a minute to think. “The DCI and President have communicated to me some possible concerns about keeping Noreiga on the CIA's payroll, especially with increased scrutiny from Congress and his past dealings with drug trafficking. Is it worth keeping him on payroll, gentlemen?”\n\nThe analysts looked at each other, then at their notes, then forward. “Yes, sir. We believe Noriega has a unique position as leader of Panama and has the ability to funnel weapons and intelligence support to Contra forces in Nicaragua, and his location with the Canal allows a large strategic advantage. His past with drug trafficking may be able to be rectified via inducements by us or State, and some troops are still stationed near the Canal Zone. Enforcement is definitely possible.”\n\nThe DDO nodded. “I see. Very well, we’ll keep him on the payroll for now. Thank you, gentlemen.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.2.d:0 "Responding to some concerns in the White House and Capitol Hill about the usefulness of maintaining relations with Noreiga’s regime, the United States today, via the Embassy in Panama City and covertly, communicated further support for General Manuel Noriega and his government.\n\nWhile not specific about what the support would entail, it is expected that the US will provide economic aid, trade relations, military aid, in exchange for Noriega’s government continuing to support anti-Communist operations. The CIA Chief of Station in Panama City has privately expressed support for further American operations in the country and in Central America at large."
 CIA_LATAMb.3.d:0 "ANTI-COMMUNISM IN CENTRAL AMERICA: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the fight to drive Communist influence out of Central and Latin America, the United States has depended heavily on anti-Communist regimes and friendly states to maintain the rule of law and order against radical guerrilla movements. Backing anti-communist leaders and parties in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama will be a responsible strategy to maintain influence in the following ways:\n\n1. Providing diplomatic support will ensure that those countries have adequate legitimacy and backing by a superpower, as well as the ability to receive economic aid and further international support in organizations such as the UN. This will increase trade ties and will ensure the continuing success of those countries.\n\n2. From the Pentagon, defense support will ensure that those countries receive equipment under the Military Assistance Program (MAP) in accordance with other anti-Communist states. Our analysis has concluded that their military capabilities are still years behind many European militaries, but equipment for counterinsurgency operations will be helpful for them.\n\n3. Finally, covert support in the form of intelligence sharing, embedding CIA operatives, training, and basing agreements will allow our operatives and intelligence operatives from those countries to properly coordinate resources and operations together to determine locations of Communist cells and methods of attack.\n\nIt is this Office’s sincere hope that these three prongs will serve as the main defense strategy for maintaining US influence, and preventing Soviet and Cuban influence, in the Latin American region."
 CIA_LATAMb.4.d:0 "Apparently as part of a renewed push by the American government to maintain influence in the region and drive out Communist incursions and rebel groups, the United States has announced an expanded backing program of anti-Communist Central American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama.\n\nThis support, reiterated by US Embassies in each country and by Foggy Bottom, consists mainly of defense support in the form of Military Assistance Program (MAP) arms sales and troop training. Additionally, diplomatic relations are expected to be beefed up along with economic and development aid being sent to each of the countries.\n\nReactions to this announcement have been mixed, with most government officials pleased that their American overlords will continue to support them regardless of their actions"
 CIA_LATAMb.5.d:0 "POSSIBLE USES FOR DRUG CARTELS: IN BRIEF\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; Drug Affairs Desk, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe presence and influence of drug cartels, organized crime syndicates focused on the trafficking of drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and cocaine, in Latin and Central America has proved a challenge in the multipolar geopolitical situation in the region. Cartel organizations, such as the Medellin Cartel in Colombia, the Guadalajara and Gulf Cartels in Mexico, and other, smaller organizations throughout the region have immense power and influence, as well as funding, weapons.\n\nOur analysis has determined that these cartels appear to be anti-communist in nature, although they are politically and ideologically malleable; the first priority of these organizations is to produce and traffic drugs, regardless of the political affiliation of their buyers. Some analysts have hypothesized that many cartel members, in the lower echelons, may be former disgruntled guerrillas that desire a change in their life and additional money.\n\nThis Office believes that the cartels mentioned above are in a financial and ideological position to be used for political benefit to the United States and its interests in Latin America. This could take the form of the following:\n\n1. American assets could assist in smuggling and other trafficking operations of narcotics around the region, with the particular focus on assisting large cartels in Mexico and Colombia. This would net the Cartels more earnings, ensure that their deliveries are not interdicted, and provide legitimacy that they are being supported by a major power.\n\n2. American assets could also assist the organization known as Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS), a Colombian paramilitary that is known to be funded by the Cartels already and has conducted many counterinsurgency operations against the Communist FARC and M-19 movements in Colombia.\n\n3. American intelligence personnel could also consider some limited domestic operations, including stonewalling or otherwise interfering with FBI and DEA investigations into drug trafficking, particularly if they are targeting Cartel members that the US supports."
 CIA_LATAMb.6.d:0 "Steve Wilkins leaned across his two-and-a-half-ton truck, smoking a cigarette as he watched the men, not 100 feet from him, unload a small Cessna 182 Skylane that had just been powered off and parked. He looked around, into the Nicaraguan jungle, more than a dozen klicks from anywhere, and then noticed the three or so armed rebels, nothing more distinguishing them than the FN FAL battle rifles they carried.\n\nAs he continued to smoke, he watched as the Contras unloading the plane moved bricks and bricks of cocaine, “snow,” into his truck, hiding it away in the far back, or in boxes of other cargo marked as “humanitarian aid.” He nodded to the men, who nodded back; confused about what they were doing, they’d see soon enough as the money began to roll in.\n\nAs they finished, he smiled, turning to the lead commander of the local Contra unit, slipping him a few cordobas before getting in the truck and starting his albeit short, but rather dangerous, journey to the coast.\n\nJust over an hour after he had left, Wilkins, code name “SKI LIFT” had reached his rendezvous point; a little fishing village, which he never learned the name of, on the Atlantic side of the country. There, he spied what appeared to be a small shrimp boat, rusted out, camouflaged in some near-water vegetation. Pulling close to it, he got out, taking a swig of water before lighting another one up, as he waited for the boat’s pilot to come to shore.\n\nHe didn’t know the pilot’s name, and probably wouldn’t have wanted to if the situation had presented itself. Shaking hands with the considerably tanner-skinned man, they began loading the bricks into the boat, three or four at a time. It took a few trips, this being a bigger shipment, but the two got it done, and promptly lit up again, shaking hands, before the pilot got in his boat, starting it and beginning to coast off, headed to Miami.\n\nSteve stood, watching, stamping out the butt of his cigarette. This had been a long deployment, but whatever Langley wanted, it got. At least it was a fairly routine mission."
 CIA_LATAMb.7.d:0 "Our efforts to smuggle larger and larger amounts of cocaine into the United States and throughout the region has been helped today by the assistance of American CIA operatives, who have been deployed to our strongholds in Nicaragua to assist with transporting the drugs across the borders, as well as with production of cocaine and protecting facilities from FSLN incursions and drug enforcement actions.\n\nIt appears the Americans are helping us primarily so that we can obtain funding for weapons and operations ourselves, instead of being dependent on them for covert funding. Their operations are going well, but it is unclear how long this is going to last, particularly because assistance to us, particularly with drugs, is seen as unpopular among congressional and administration officials."
 CIA_LATAMb.8.d:0 "Oscar Danilo Blandon sat in his van, in South Central Los Angeles, just waiting. It was a quiet summer day, and as he sat, he thought about how far his cargo had traveled from where it was made. Grown and refined in Colombia, smuggled via plane north to Nicaragua by Contra connections, hauled cross-country, onto a shrimp boat, shipped to Miami, and making its way via unmarked van to unmarked van all the way to Los Angeles, where he picked it up.\n\nHe was waiting for his partner, Ricky Ross. A Black native of this particular LA neighborhood, Blandon had been told that Ross was the only drug dealer in the city who had contacted the Colombians. This was great. Blandon had to count again, but he figured there were a couple million dollars worth of cocaine in the back. A tidy little sum to help his comrades in Nicaragua, fighting the communist bastards.\n\nRoss walked up, and shook hands with Blandon as he got out of the van. They were sitting outside a park, which was empty at the moment; thank God for that, both of them thought. Blandon popped open the back of the van, and the two of them got in, closing the door. They had to make this quick, before a “black-and-white” LAPD patrol car came.\n\n“Holy shit, man!” Ross whispered, seeing the bricks and bricks of cocaine. Blandon nodded. “It’s two or three million dollars there, if I had to guess. The Cartel made a larger batch this time.”\n\nRoss smiled. “Nice, man, nice. Let’s go take this back to my place, and I’ll call my dealers up, and we can get going. I’m really excited about this, and I think all my buyers will think this is great. By the way, where is the money going? Back to the Cartel?”\n\nBlandon looked down at the bricks then back up. “If I tell you, does it affect our deal?”\nRoss looked around. “No? Drugs are drugs. I was just curious.”\n“The Contras. Freedom fighters in Nicaragua, fighting against the tyrannical communist regime. The money is going to them for arms and operations.”\n\nRoss nodded. “Good.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.9.d:0 "“What the fuck is this memo?” The secretary outside the DDO’s office winced as she heard her boss yell. While not a rare sight, she mustered up the courage and walked in.\n\n“Sir, that memo is from the DDI and Latin America Desk. Apparently, they find it prudent to consider drug distribution here, in order to finance the Contras.”\n\n“Get me the DDI on the phone now! Fuck!”\n\n“Yes, sir.” She had never seen him this mad, but punched the line through to the DDI’s office, which was nearby but not close to the DDO on the Seventh Floor at Langley.\n\n“Deputy Director for Intelligence’s office. Who’s this?”\n“YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHO IT IS!! PUT YOUR BOSS ON THE LINE!”\n“Yes, sir.” There was a click, then the DDI picked up. “Yes?”\n“What the FUCK is this memo that I’m reading?”\n“Well, it’s what it looks like. Our analysts have looked it over and have come to the conclusion that helping the Contras to distribute their cocaine in the US and in other states will net them enough funding and influence to become more self-sufficient then they are right now.”\n“Are you fucking nuts? You know if this ever gets out, DEA is going to be up my ass, FBI is going to fuck me and the Hill? They’d crucify us! Do you hear me?!”\n\n“Congress might think twice when the Contras take their country back from the Sandinistas.”\n\n“Enough. Ops is not greenlighting this. End it. We’re done here.”\nClick.\n\nThe secretary turned slowly, trying to gauge the DDO’s mood. He still seemed angry, but the room was strangely quiet."
 CIA_LATAMb.10.d:0 "As the Latin America Desk staff gathered together for their weekly meeting, they settled in with coffee and pastries, being careful not to stain the files they had on the conference table.\n\n“Well, I’ve been looking into a new group that’s been making the rounds in Colombia,” said Jim, the analyst focused on the Colombian conflict. “They call themselves Muerte a Secuestradores, or “Death to Kidnappers.” The Desk Director nodded, letting him continue.\n\n“MAS appears to be formed and founded by the major drug cartels in Colombia, including the large Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar. Their main mission is not offensive, but defensive in nature, protecting Cartel and prominent landowners’ property as well as preventing kidnapping attempts by other paramilitaries. Other major funders appear to be the Colombian military and oddly enough, Texaco, based here in the United States.”\n\nThe Desk Director nodded. “I see. So this MAS. Where do they fit into our policy?”\n\n“Well, sir, MAS presents the perfect opportunity to become involved in Colombia without committing too many resources. They are committed anti-Communists, having conducted operations against FARC and M-19, the major Communist guerrilla groups in Colombia; they are connected with the drug cartels, in particular the Medellin Cartel, allowing US assets to contact the Cartel directly and initiate further operations.”\n\n“Interesting, Jim. Give me your report and I’ll pass it up the chain, we’ll consider backing MAS. Should be easy enough.”"
 CIA_LATAMb.11.d:0 "Sources from within the Colombian military and intelligence services are reporting that the United States has begun covertly supporting the Cartel-founded paramilitary group known as Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS), or “Death to Kidnappers.” Founded by the Medellin Cartel and assisted by some units of the Colombian Army, MAS was formed to protect Cartel and landowner property as a defense group as well as prevent kidnappings of Cartel members.\n\nThe Americans did not inform us of this development, perhaps out of a suspicion that we intend on prosecuting the Cartels. The US Ambassador in Bogota has made no comment, however, we have requested the CIA Chief of Station to report to brief our intelligence officials. It is not clear whether this will actually happen."
 CIA_LATAMb.12.d:0 "As Bob sat in the back of a nondescript Chevrolet Caprice, bumping along across rural roads, a jeep in front, he thought about what he was embarking on. After what seemed like weeks of searching and inquiries via agents and informants, the CIA Chief of Station in Bogota had tasked him with meeting The leader of the Medellin Cartel, none other than the infamous Pablo Escobar, at one of his villas in rural Colombia.\n\nHe was nervous but knew that nothing major would probably happen. He and Escobar already knew what was going to happen, and surely the Cartel wouldn’t do anything to him, unless they wanted to invite large amounts of American firepower and the dismantlement of their organization.\n\nPulling up to Escobar’s villa, he got out of the car and was promptly searched (again) by two of Escobar’s lieutenants, while a few others watched from various distances, carrying automatic rifles. Bob was unarmed, of course, but they had to check again and again.\n\n“Good evening, Senor Escobar,” Bob said, after he had been searched and escorted into the villa, where Pablo was sitting with a few lieutenants and other Cartel figures.\n\n“Welcome to the real Colombia-” Escobar extended his hand and paused.\n\n“It’s Bob, Senor Escobar. Very nice to finally be able to meet you. I’m sure you know what this is about.” They shook hands.\n\n“Yes, Bob. I’ve been told from some of my lieutenants that your CIA wants to expand collaboration with us and help with trafficking. I am interested but reluctant; how can you help us?\n\n“Well, Senor Escobar, we propose helping out with Cartel trafficking operations, primarily through directing it through Miami and across the Mexican border into the United States. There are plenty of American cities that are just discovering this cocaine of yours and it is a big market, particularly in Los Angeles. The funds you earn will both go back here to support your Cartel and the ongoing conflict in Colombia, as well as some funds to go to the Contras in Nicaragua, who are doing the same thing.”\n\n“I see.” Escobar paused, taking a moment to think before pouring out two glasses of aguardiente, a local liquor. “I will have to discuss it more with my traffickers, but I like this idea. I think we have similar ideas and goals, and, if your CIA is able to get the Colombian government off my tail, we’re in business.”\n\n“Yes, I believe we can do that.” Bob, seeing that Escobar was doing the same, took a glass, clinking it to Pablo’s as they toasted, marking the deal as done. “To more money for the cause!”"

 CIA_LATAMb.14.d:0 "MANUEL NORIEGA AND US RELATIONS: AN UPDATE\nPanama Desk, Office of Latin America Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the intervening period since the US has continued its support for Panamanian leader General Manuel Noriega, circumstances have changed in which the United States intelligence community may reconsider Noreiga’s usefulness to maintaining American influence in Central and Latin America.\n\nWhile General Noriega has contributed greatly to American security policy in Latin America, his behavior is undeniably a liability for US influence in the region. In particular, Noriega’s possible connections with organized crime, Cartels, and drug trafficking of cocaine presents a significant concern and development for future US-Panama relations.\n\nAccording to operatives and law enforcement personnel following Noriega’s activities, he has been involved with cocaine trafficking since the beginning of the decade, using covert transportation networks also used by the CIA to send funds and weapons to anti-Communist movements in the region. Primarily, Noreiga’s network has run out of Miami, where it is then spread to the rest of the United States. FBI and DEA personnel confirm this but are unable to take any punitive action against Noriega and his government.\n\nAdditionally, CIA confirms that opposition figures in Panama such as Hugo Spadafora and Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera also have knowledge of Noriega’s drug trafficking operations and have attempted to uncover them in the Panamanian popular media. Noriega’s government has not taken kindly to this, and Spadafora has not been heard from in several days, indicating that he possibly may have been killed or arrested. Neither men have been considered threats to the state before and are not left-wing in political ideology; in fact, both served under Torrijos’ government.\n\nThis Office hereby recommends a serious evaluation of Noriega’s usefulness to US interests in Latin America; if the allegations of drug trafficking are true, which seems to be substantiated, it is highly encouraged that the United States cut ties with Noriega, and consider taking punitive action towards Panama, including freezing all aid packages, arms shipments, covert transfers, assistance, and enforcing drug interdiction operations until the regime can be stabilized."
 CIA_LATAMb.15.d:0 "It was a sunny Monday morning in the Oval, as CIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir] and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] came into the room for their daily briefing. Today would be just an ordinary briefing, but with one new item on the agenda: General Manuel Noriega of Panama.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen. I trust we’re doing well at Langley?” President [USA.GetLeader] looked up, smiling.\n\n“Yes, sir, all’s going well there. Here’s your Daily Brief for today.” The National Security Advisor laid the PDB down on the desk.\n\n“Great. What’s first on the agenda?”\n\n“Panama, sir. CIA’s been reconsidering the effectiveness and usefulness of keeping General Manuel Noriega within our sphere of influence and assisting his regime. There are allegations that he’s been conducting drug trafficking operations in Panama and moving cocaine between Colombia and Miami. He has also persecuted former allies who have attempted to uncover the drug trafficking operations, and Langley is concerned about the possible effect this could have.”\n\n“I see, what do you mean?” The President nodded, thinking.\n“Congress might catch wind, and that’s never good. We may lose international support in other places if we don’t respond to this promptly.”\n\n“Who cares about Congress? I say we keep Noriega in line with us.” The President had spent the last few minutes actually reading the brief in front of him, which happened to highlight Noriega’s help in security issues in Latin America.\n\n“Consider this, gentlemen. We have backed Noriega for years, he has been very friendly with us; we have provided him and his military with millions of dollars worth of weapons in their fight against Communist forces to their north; and Director, how long has this trafficking been going on?”\n\n“For years, sir. At least since he took office officially.”\n\n“So why now is all this coming to light? I see no reason why we need to cut the cord now. Doing that would only make our situation in Latin America worse. He’s an asset.”\n\n“Yes, sir.” Both men responded. The Director looked up. “Sir, we can issue a confidential statement to the Panamanians via their military or CIA, to reassure them of our continuing support.”\n\nThe President nodded. “Yes, it sounds good.” He looked around. “What’s next on the agenda?”"
 CIA_LATAMb.16.d:0 "According to unofficial reports from diplomatic officials in Washington, as well as sources within the US Embassy in Panama City, the US will continue to support the government of Manuel Noriega, despite a rather vocal opposition that questioned his usefulness in American foreign policy as regards his past with illicit drug trafficking, as well as other allegations.\n\nSenior American intelligence officials had been grappling with the issue of whether to maintain support for Noriega for weeks, particularly as the conflicts in Colombia and Nicaragua continue to rage on. Our government has yet to respond, although the only public response should be one of optimism and continued support. However, in the shadows, it is imperative that we contact the Americans and demand a reason for their reluctance."

We need to be fast about this, pretend like we were never there.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. President.” The CIA Director and National Security Advisor nodded, and went to make some calls. It would be a long day and an even longer night."
 CIA_LATAMb.18.d:0 "Shock radiated throughout Panama City today as confidential sources at the US Embassy reported that the United States was pulling back support for Manuel Noriega’s government.

Senior defense and diplomatic officials in Panama City who have been briefed already are indicating plans to accelerate the phased-out withdrawal of US troops from the Canal Zone, and other punitive actions, such as possibly declaring embassy officials as “persona non grata” and forcing them to leave.

 CIA_LATAMb.19.d:0 "It was dusk as a small, inconspicuous convoy of vans, heavy-duty trucks, and sedans approached the border checkpoint on the Paso del Norte International Bridge, connecting El Paso, Texas, with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. There was little traffic, and as the lead car, a gray, unmarked Ford Granada, stopped for inspection, they noticed there was slightly more police presence than normal; not on the American side, but on the Mexican side. In addition to the usual customs and border officers, were located Federales, on watch.\n\nThe convoy moved smoothly through, no issues, even with the trucks marked “Arizona Helicopters Inc.” and “Pacific Corporation.” The border guards didn’t bother inspecting the cargo, and they wouldn’t have liked what they saw. Hundreds of automatic rifles, thousands of rounds of ammunition, M72 anti-tank rocket launchers, a few Stingers; they’d have to train the men on those, but no problem. The larger trucks contained a few utility helicopters, completely disassembled, with their gun mounts ready for action. One of the operatives had said there was a Cessna somewhere, hidden away, apparently.\n\nAfter a few hours’ drive south from Ciudad Juarez, the convoy approached its destination; one of the central bases of the Guadalajara Cartel in Chihuahua State. They would conduct the training here, then the Cartel would distribute the equipment throughout their territory.\n\nThe operative got out of the lead car, lighting up a cigarette as he watched the trucks pass by, leading into the main parking area of the compound. This would be a long deployment period, and all his operatives knew it. The Cartel would be trained, because they were important to the US government, but whether they would be cooperative was another story. They are criminals in the eyes of normal people, after all. But no one here was a normal person."
 CIA_LATAMb.20.d:0 "Reports from the Federal Security Directorate and the Secretariat for the Interior seem to indicate that major Cartel leaders in Mexico, including the leaders of the Guadalajara and Gulf Cartels, appear to have received new arms and protection equipment of US make and model. DFS agents have conducted surveillance on Cartel properties with the assistance of Mexican Army and Federal Police units, and have determined that new US-made equipment, apparently received from a US company called “Arizona Helicopters Inc.” has been delivered to Cartel units; including small arms, heavy machine guns, armored pickup trucks, and a few old-model UH-1 Huey helicopters and Cessna airplanes.\n\nPresident [MEX.GetLeader] is reportedly furious at this development, particularly with the mixed relations that Mexico and the United States have. Some senior members within the government are expressing surprise at why the Cartels would be protected, particularly from enforcement operations by Mexico, an ally of the United States, ostensibly. It is unclear why this is, and the US Embassy in Mexico City has been unable to answer any questions on the matter. Time will tell."
 CIA_LATAMb.21.d:0 "As the joint FBI-DEA task force sat down for their meeting, a sunny morning in El Paso, Texas, they looked deadly serious. This had not been the first meeting; just a regular situation update for the two agencies.\n\nThe DEA agents began with their presentation first. “Our investigation into local Cartel activity has yielded significant results. The cross-border connection between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez is rather significant; although the transfers of drugs from Mexico into Texas are small-scale in nature; usually small amounts, a few pounds or two, via personal vehicles. DEA and ELPD have not seen large amounts of drugs over 5 pounds. Cartel activity in El Paso has been somewhat limited; we know there are members who are American nationals on the US side of the border operating as regional bosses and middlemen; however, we haven’t been able to connect them yet.”\n\nThe FBI agents nodded. “Alright. We know that there are large quantities of cocaine coming from the border cities; El Paso included, as well as Albuquerque, San Diego, and Laredo. FBI has identified a pair of dealers in Los Angeles who are receiving large shipments of cocaine from Colombian Cartels, but we’re not quite sure where. We may consider filing some federal warrants for bugging and other surveillance operations.”\n\nBefore he could continue, a secretary came in. “Special Agent, there’s a call for you.”\n\nHe stepped out of the conference room, moving to his office to take the call.\n“Hello?”\n“Is this Special Agent Jack Smith?”\n“Yes, who’s this?”\n\n“That’s not important. All you need to know is that we at Langley know about your investigation into Colombian Cartels. We know the judges you need to talk to. We know who you’re looking into, and it needs to stop now. Keep going, and you’ll learn the hard way not to mess with the Cartels.”\nClick."
 CIA_LATAMb.22.d:0 "In rainy New York City, Vincent Gigante looked out onto the Manhattan skyline. There was another man sitting in his office; Italian descent, sure, but not “from here.” He looked, acted like one of those rotten feds. Head of the Genovese Family, one of the five great Mafia families of New York, he had been visited by this man with a proposition: the great tragedy in Nicaragua, and a way his family could profit. Surely there were a lot of Nicaraguan emigres in New York City, right?\n\nA thousand miles south, in sunny Miami, Florida, Jose Miguel Battle Sr. had been approached by three similar men. Colleagues of his, all former soldiers in Brigade 2506, having survived the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion, all here for the same reason. The Corporation, as it was known in Miami, the Cuban Mafia, as it was also known, could have great solidarity with this fellow anti-communist group in Nicaragua known as the Contras. Or that’s at least what they claimed.\n\nAlso in a famously sunny place, Southern California, members of the Mexican Mafia were being contacted. Some were in prison, some weren’t, but it didn’t matter. The men in black from Langley had their ways. California was an excellent transshipment point for cocaine, as was Miami, and the Mexican Mafia had a lot of influence both there and across the border in Tijuana.\n\n The men from Langley all had one goal. Criminal organizations had plenty of influence in the United States, particularly in urban areas where drug trafficking and crime was high. Surely they had to have the money, weapons, and resources to send to their brothers in arms in Nicaragua, right?"
 CIA_LATAMb.23.d:0 "More news has come from the CIA operatives assisting us; Langley has apparently directed operatives to work on rallying support for the Contra cause among organized crime groups in the United States. While not specific, the CIA has informed us that the criminal Cuban exile community in Miami, centered around Jose Miguel Battle Sr, a Bay of Pigs veteran himself has pledged support to us; as well as the Mexican Mafia, which is located around the US-Mexican border as well as Southern California. Additionally, two of the five prominent New York City Mafia families have also pledged their support for our cause, and are willing to shift funds, some mafia members, and weapons to the Contras to support our mission.\n\nMany within our organization are glad to hear this development, particularly the support from the Cuban Mafia. Others seem reluctant about the development, becoming worried of the lack of legitimacy among these criminal groups as opposed to a sovereign state like the US."

 CIA_LATAMc.0.d:0 "It was an overcast and foggy morning in the Oval Office as President [USA.GetLeader] sat, watching as his Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] and their flurry of aides enter the room, with files and papers seemingly flying everywhere. The President waited for the chaos to simmer down before opening up the room. “Gentlemen, why are we here today?”\n\nThe Secretary of State began. “Well, Mr. President, State has had several meetings with CIA and defense officials about the future of US policy in Central and South America. In the past, the United States has taken the wrong step in that region, and we seek to change that.”\n\n“Go on, Mr. Secretary. I assume this means a more peaceful strategy as I have mentioned in my foreign policy positions.”\n\n“Yes, sir. We think that the US has needlessly enabled authoritarian right-wing regimes in Central and South America as part of a misguided attempt to combat the spread of communism in the region. While that has been marginally effective, it has had the unfortunate side effect of creating militarized states controlled by officers who have personal ambitions, creating even more instability.”\n\nThe CIA Director broke in. “Not to mention, Mr. President, this region is faced with a major drug trafficking challenge, something that our Agency has not seen on such a scale before. Large shipments of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are moving north from Colombia, being shipped by cartels, and usually supported by right-wing governments. I know your administration has campaigned on ending the War on Drugs campaign, but this is an international issue that we need to take part in.”\n\n“Ensuring self-determination and the effective rule of law exists in Central America is critical, Mr. President. Democratic societies ensure greater accountability to all parties involved. In particular, we’d like to expand peace initiatives in Nicaragua, as well as determining cutting aid programs in Central America and reexamining our cooperation with General Noriega in Panama.\n\n“Excellent, gentlemen. I trust you all to do this with the highest degree of professionalism and report to me with all changes. I expect to read at least once a week at least on this issue.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President.” The men and their aides nodded in approval, as they exited the room, just as the sun began to show itself form behind the clouds, brightening the room."
 CIA_LATAMc.1.d:0 "It was a hot night in Oaxaca state as the jeep rumbled down the dusty street in Tehauntepec. The driver knew exactly where he was going, but the passenger, Ruben Ocampo, wasn’t so sure. All he knew was he had to meet some local officials, as his brief said, at their home tonight.\n\nOcampo looked around, noticing the barrio that he was passing through. It was nothing fancy, on the outskirts of town, unfortunately what you’d come to expect in this area, with these people. It was a shame what had been done to them, but that’s what he was there for.\n\nGetting out of the car, the “investigative reporter” walked down the driveway, watching the jeep roll away. He held a notebook in his hand, acting normal as ever. Knocking on the door once, he was ushered into the home, sitting down in the dining area, where three men and one woman sat, in traditional Tehuana dress. These people were indigenous Zapotec people, most of whom lived in the region, but they were important political organizers, albeit nearly underground due to PRI influence.\n\nWhat was said wasn’t necessary, but Ocampo asked them about their activism and organizing and how the local governmental authorities had ignored them. He asked them about how they felt about the cartels in their area; how they felt about the growing Zapatista movement in their area, and where they and their organization stood. Ocampo smiled, nodded, and cracked jokes; for all they knew, he was an investigative journalist with La Prensa, a Mexico City paper. Their conversation was not long but not short, and productive.\n\nAs Ocampo was whisked back out of the house, back to his driver, back to Mexico City, he reviewed the notes. This would be a long report to type up, one that hopefully his Chief of Station in Mexico City would appreciate. The indigenous groups seemed to be anti-government, anti-cartel, and pro-communist. Interesting stuff, he thought."
 CIA_LATAMc.2.d:0 "POLITICAL REFORMS IN CENTRAL AMERICA\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe geopolitical region known as Central America (including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama) have been plagued by continual political crises since the beginning of the postwar period. Attempts at political reform have been proposed and some implemented, but most have failed due to US or Communist interference. Therefore, this Office proposes the following general political reforms in order to improve democratic rule and the standard of living in the region:\n\n1. Executive reform, in the form of perhaps limiting presidential powers, including the power to declare war, declare a state of emergency, and powers relating to the command of military units. This would most likely require constitutional revision in most Central American states, which will require persuasion of the national legislature.\n\n2. Judicial and legal reform, in the form of strengthening Supreme Courts and national judicial branches. This can be accomplished by enshrining judicial review of constitutional and legislative actions which are designed to provide a balance to executive and legislative actions in those countries.\n\n3. Finally, military reform, in the form of introducing further checks against military coups, such as providing civilian leadership of the military, barring military officers from running for office, and restricting aid to Central American militaries who are not compliant with US enforcement regulations.\n\nThis Office, together with relevant US Embassies and the Department of State, believes urging these reforms will ensure adequate governing style and self-determination for that region, without excessive presidential powers or harassment from Communist forces."
 CIA_LATAMc.3.d:0 "A joint American State Department and CIA campaign has come to our region, encouraging a broad program of political reforms in our countries. Apparently in an attempt to guide Central American states toward an American model of government with representative democracy and republicanism, the US Embassy has urged reform of the executive and judicial branches as well as the military; including limiting the power of the President to declare states of emergency, combat insurgencies, as well as providing possible judicial review mechanisms. Finally, the US has proposed military reforms, which have angered some in our government, that have been “designed to prevent further coups” which in reality will weaken the influence and capability of the armed forces in the future if we choose to accept them.\n\nIt is unclear how our government should respond to this. Reforms are necessary, some say, to further democratize the country; but others contend that reforms would provide more influence to radicals of both wings within the country. There is also understandable concern that the military reforms will result in decreased capability. Many contend that reforms, especially dictated by the US, are not necessary, but perhaps acceding to demands from Washington will turn out to be good in the long run. How should we move forward?"
 CIA_LATAMc.4.d:0 "News has come in from our embassies in Central America that the governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama have all agreed, in principle, to political reforms that have been suggested by CIA chiefs of station, operatives, and State Department officials.\n\nSome of the political reforms, proposed by a Joint Working Group of CIA and State political advisors, have included executive reforms in order to curtail presidential overreach, judicial reform in the form of introducing judicial review and American-style legal systems, and military reform in the form of introducing civilian control of the military, eliminating corruption, and threatening to end MAP aid to those countries.\n\nLangley and Foggy Bottom are both rather surprised that these countries agreed to such reforms so easily, but are making immediate bounds in determining enforcement regimes to ensure that all parties adhere to the reforms they promised to do."
 CIA_LATAMc.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, news has come in from our embassies in Central America that the governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama have all rejected proposed political reforms that have been suggested by CIA chiefs of station, operatives, and State Department officials.\n\nSome of the ill-fated political reforms, including proposals to limit presidential overreach, introduce judicial review and American legal systems, and provide for civilian control of the military were all soundly rejected by each and every government, with the accusation of “further attempts at imperialism from Washington into our internal affairs.”\n\nLangley and Foggy Bottom are understandably furious over this development, particularly the reputation that will proceed once the international press catches wind of these developments. Damage control plans are in place, but neither agency, nor the President, will be happy about this development."
 CIA_LATAMc.6.d:0 "HANDLING COMMUNIST IDEOLOGUES IN CENTRAL AMERICA\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn our newfound plan to advance ideals of democracy and self-determination in Latin America, the problem of Communist parties and ideologues in all of those states presents a hindrance to our development. While the United States remains fundamentally opposed to communism, we cannot interfere in democratic processes, particularly those involving the left wing. Ideologues, however, present a fundamental threat to American influence and self-determination and must be sidelined.\n\n1. Coercion could be used to blackmail or otherwise extort Communist ideologues to either recant their ideology, change it to social democracy which will not be as politically radical as communism.\n\n2. Currency payments and other cost of living benefits may also be considered as a means of sidelining ideologues and Communist party officials in Latin America, although this strategy is not recommended primarily because this will increase dependence on further cash payments.\n\n3. Finally, appealing to ideologues’ and leaders’ egos may also be beneficial to sidelining them. Simply ignoring or directly fighting Communist leaders will not be effective, but properly sidelining them while making them feel successful will be effective in keeping them under control while we advance our plan.\n\nThis Office believes that properly sidelining the Communists covertly will maintain semblances of democratic values and self-determination without being overtly involved in the region, and not affecting other parties of the left wing."

However, it is time for us to end this relationship.\n\nYour activities surrounding trafficking of marijuana and cocaine have presented quite a concern to the current administration. Previous administrations and presidents may have tolerated this sort of behavior but it is in the best domestic and international interest of the United States not to collaborate with organized crime elements, particularly those in other sovereign states, and especially those that are responsible for funneling dangerous narcotics.\n\nThis letter serves as final notice from the United States Government that we will not continue cooperation with your criminal enterprise and will be eagerly supporting any and all law enforcement attempts to shut down your operations.\n\nRegards,\nPresident [USA.GetLeader]\nCIA Director [GetCurrentCIADir]"

The watch officer for Latin America reported last night that a joint Miami PD-DEA task force seized a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship with hundreds of pounds of crack cocaine hidden aboard it.”\n\n“Shit.” The DDO put his head in his hands.\n\n“Yes, sir. Noriega denied any responsibility but we know he did it, he’s not even being careful anymore.” The Ops officer shrugged.\n\nThe DDO straightened back up again. “Alright. It’s done. We’re ending this.” He pointed to the two men across the table. “Stay here. I’m getting the Director and the National Security Advisor on the phone. We’re cutting Noriega off. Enough.”\n\nWithin minutes, the Ops officer sat in shocked silence as Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] came on the line, in addition to National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv]. The two other men agreed, and a call was put into the President, via the DCI. The Ops officer and his deputy sat, waiting for an order. He was sure the Chief of Station would have to be called too, but this was happening real fast, he thought."

 CIA_LATAMc.11.d:0 "COMPROMISE WITH NICARAGUA?\nOffice of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; US Embassy, Managua\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAfter years of backing anti-Communist “Contra” forces in Nicaragua, currently ruled by a Marxist Sandinista government known as the FSLN, the United States may now be faced with a new opportunity to turn the tide in the conflict. Instead of continually backing the Contras, forcing a frozen conflict that would end in a stalemate, this Office recommends a compromise with the Sandinista regime to ensure parity between both parties and end the conflict.\n\n1. An immediate ceasefire and end to hostilities while negotiations begin. This will be on both sides, with the United States seeking to enforce the Contras from committing violence or attacks against Sandinista forces.\n\n2. The formation of a temporary Coalition Government, composed of equal amounts of Sandinista (FSLN), Contra, and democratic parties. This will allow a stable governing structure, and the maintenance of ceasefires, while further democratic reforms are put into place.\n\n3. Once the Coalition Government has been formed, elections will be held at an agreed upon time. These elections should be observed and enforced by international observers, both from the United States, other Central American countries, and teams from the United Nations and Organization of American States; to ensure that either party does not rig the election or otherwise coerce the populace into an unfair election.\n\n4. Finally, a constitutional convention will be convened with the cooperation of both the Sandinistas and the Contras to determine a new, pluralist, multi-party and democratic constitution, designed to ensure and enshrine a more permanent and democratic government, as well as the cooperation (or friendly competition) of the Contras and Sandinistas. Further reforms should press demobilization, military reform, and other changes designed to eliminate further outbreaks of violence in the country."
 CIA_LATAMc.12.d:0 "The US Ambassador to Nicaragua has come to the Office of the President of Nicaragua [NIC.GetLeader] with a compromise in our effort to crush the American-backed Contra, anti-Communist rebels.\n\nThe Americans, presumably in an attempt to extricate themselves from their proxy war against us, have proposed a ceasefire, the formation of a Coalition Government between our FSLN and the Contra rebels; the scheduling of free and fair elections, and a constitutional rewrite to ensure plurality and multi-party democracy.\n\nFigures in our government have had mixed reactions to this development. Since the Ambassador has come and gone, various ministers have voiced their support for or displeasure with the deal. Some think it would be a good idea in order to stop the conflict and perhaps invite better US perception of the regime; but many others, ideologically committed, have remained against it, convinced that the deal is not beneficial to Nicaragua and that submitting to US hegemony is not the way to solve the issue; instead, crushing the Contras should continue.\n\nThis is a difficult and nuanced issue, but the President wants to reply to Washington soon. How should we respond?"
 CIA_LATAMc.13.d:0 "Surprising news has come in from our Embassy in Managua that the government of Nicaragua, under the Marxist FSLN, also known as the Sandinistas, have accepted our proposal for a compromise to settle the conflict between them and the US-backed anti-Communist Contra guerilla groups.\n\nOur proposal, consisting of a ceasefire, the formation of a Coalition Government, a new constitution and free, observed elections, was reluctantly accepted by the Sandinistas in Managua today, with a government spokesman stating that “concessions are necessary to ensure peace and stability in Nicaragua once again.”\n\nFoggy Bottom and Langley are moving forward to implement a two-pronged program to begin the peace plan, with the CIA reaching out to Contra figures to begin a ceasefire between the two parties, and the State Department working out of the Embassy to maintain contacts with the Sandinista government as well as to gain international support via the UN and OAS for enforcement of the peace plan."

Military aid to Central American regimes, including Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, designed to augment their security services, has been misused, according to the Office of Latin American Analysis, instead being used for internal counterinsurgency operations, including extrajudicial killings, beatings, and destruction of civilian property. Little accountability has been shown by chief military leaders in all states involved.\n\n2. Economic aid to Central American regimes, designed to augment their agricultural and manufacturing capabilities as well as to improve infrastructure and communications systems, has been massively misused by each of the governments; instead, being diverted to coffers of prominent government officials, used as bribes, or placed in the budget of the military and other security services. There is no enforcement of economic reforms, nor is there enforcement of construction initiatives on the part of the United States.\n\n3. Covert aid, in the form of operatives and operational assistance in combating communist movements and drug cartels, is being hampered by high officials in governmental positions. Operatives within the Directorate of Operations have reported that their operations and orders from above have been stonewalled by uncooperative security services personnel, sometimes requiring bribes and other forms of coercion to accomplish designated mission goals.\n\nIt is the opinion of both Offices, and therefore both the Directorate of Intelligence and Directorate of Operations, that all forms of aid to Central American regimes must be stopped unless the United States can negotiate an enforcement plan with the countries receiving aid, and they pledge to submit to further checks."
 CIA_LATAMc.17.d:0 "Stunning news has appeared from the US Ambassador today as the United States simultaneously announced that they will be halting all aid to our country and other countries within the region if we do not take more action to ensure that the aid is not being misused.\n\nCiting concerns about mismanagement and corruption within our government and within the region at large, the United States has said that they will end all military, economic, and covert aid and assistance to us unless we agree to negotiate further enforcement of aid spending and use under their watchful eye.\n\nMembers within our government are split on the issue; prominent political and military officials argue that we can simply seek another, more agreeable benefactor, while lower-level officers and bureaucrats argue that acceding to further enforcement will provide a better option in the long run under US influence.

In particular, emphasis was placed on ensuring that aid will be used for economic and infrastructure improvement, as opposed to the current use which is towards military officials, counterinsurgency operations, and bribes to prominent government officials.\n\nFoggy Bottom is pleased with this development and expects to brief the President and other diplomatic and security officials within the end of the day."

As previous administrations have proven, maintaining our reputation among Latin American countries is paramount. In the past, we have treated them as a vessel of exploitation, for economic benefit; by our government, or US corporations. However, the United States should not fall into the trap of installing right-wing governments in order to maintain a friendly face. Maintaining self-determination initiatives in the region should be the utmost priority as the United States has had a history of influencing elections in the past.\n\n2. Drug enforcement operations should also be highlighted as a primary concern of US-Central American cooperation, in addition to further military aid and training initiatives proposed by the Pentagon. In particular, the US wants to push a combined, international effort via the Organization of American States to end trafficking of cocaine and marijuana via military and law enforcement actions.\n\nThis Office believes that this double-pronged policy plan will stabilize the region without conceding to radical interests on either side of the political spectrum and will effectively maintain US influence with little to no belligerency."
 CIA_LATAMc.22.d:0 "As Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] entered the large conference room, a hush fell over the room, among the business executives and senior vice presidents sitting there. None of them knew why they had been called here, just that their secretaries had been spooked by mysterious phone calls directing their bosses to come to Langley right away.\n\n“Gentlemen, welcome to Langley. I’m sure you’re all wondering why we called you here.” Most of the executives nodded. “Some of you probably think we’re going to ask you to do some secret-spy missions, but that’s not why we’re here.” That elicited a small laugh, which the DCI was glad about, because he was about to turn to a more serious subject.\n\n“You’re here because your companies and corporations have heavy influence in Latin America. From Chiquita, to Cargill, to Freeport-McMoRan, industry is diversified and I’m sure that your shareholders and the local economies in the region appreciate it.”\n\n“However, we here at the Agency, as well as across the Potomac in DC, have become concerned about some of your actions. Many policy officials at State and Commerce believe your business practices are inherently destabilizing the region, and that your influence is helping to prop up right-wing and neo-fascist regimes in the region.” The room was suddenly filled with a quiet hush of confusion, leading to a louder volume of blustering.\n\n“Now, I admit that our government in the past has no better, but we have changed our ways and are committed to helping with reforms in the region. You all know as well as I do that your corporations hold just as much if not more influence in Central and South American governments; they are so economically dependent that if you make them reform, they will follow through.”\n\nThe executives looked down, around at each other, then back up at the DCI. “Are you for real?,” a senior vice president at Cargill asked.\n\n“Yes, yes, I am. You would still have economic benefits, but also providing the people with a better quality of life. You are paying them, you know.”\n\nThe executives sighed. “Okay. We’ll take it back up with our boards, I suppose, at least I will. Not sure how this’ll go, Director.”"
 CIA_LATAMc.23.d:0 "It was a hot night in southeastern Guatemala, near San Marcos, as an employee of Chiquita, formerly United Fruit Company, drove down the dusty road in his new but beat-up Ford sedan. He was not a native employee, but an American mid-level manager, sent to supervise the banana production in the area. His bosses hadn’t cared where he was from, just that he knew enough Spanish to yell at the laborers, and enough sense to know how to bribe the local council and soldiers.\n\nHe kept driving, swiping the sweat from his brow. Stopping at a checkpoint outside the city of San Marcos, he pulled out his papers and a few quetzals for the soldiers; he knew they needed the money, anyway.\n\n“Buenas noches, gentlemen,” the manager said, extending his papers as the window finished rolling down. The soldiers smiled, taking the money but flipping through, then tapping on the door for more. The manager shrugged. “That’s all I have, guys.” The soldiers nodded, opening the gate and letting him through.\n\nTen seconds later, the car exploded in a hail of automatic gunfire, dozens of bullets shattering the glass and leaving the manager a bloody mess. One of the soldiers, walking over to the car, busted the rest of the window, dispatching the man to make sure he was really dead.\n\nAnother man on a motorbike, coming the other direction, stopped, as if he knew what was going on. He got out, waving to the men, who lowered their guns. “Here’s your pay, men.” The two smiled, splitting the bills and stuffing them in their pockets as they checked their rifles again. Another banana man dead, they thought. Whatever it took for the highest bidder."
 CIA_LATAMc.24.d:0 "Marcus Greene was tired from the day’s heat, but they had just gotten a new lead. As part of a new program with the National Police of Nicaragua, Greene had been embedded as an advisor, albeit one with some limited roles. The Nicaraguan Government had been suspicious of the CIA’s eagerness to help, but when they mentioned preventing Contra drug trafficking, the Sandinistas reluctantly accepted.\n\nThe police embedded with him were no ordinary cops; they had been trained in drug enforcement to an extent but were coopted by the Communists during their rise to power. Politics really didn’t matter here, far from Managua, as they had a shared goal.\n\nGreene and his squad were at a port, albeit a small one, where the police knew cocaine traffickers came. They had seen a dozen small fishing and shrimp boats and had searched all of them but to no avail; however, one officer had talked to a local man who reported he saw a white man helping to offload something out of a truck and onto a boat. It was worth investigating, especially since the Contras were known to heavily operate here.\n\nGoing out to deeper water in a dinghy, Greene pointed out the boat that the man had identified. It was a rusty, 20-foot long, barely seaworthy boat, with a Panamanian flag; not overly suspicious, but typically what would be used to traffick drugs. There was one man on it, a nervous-looking guy; Greene guessed he was the owner of the boat. The Nicaraguans questioned him briefly, before he tried to wave them off to no avail. A brief scuffle erupted, but the man was tackled and shoved against a wall, where the Nicaraguan cops beat him before cuffing him.\n\nGreene looked out on the water, wondering how many other small boats they hadn’t been able to catch today. At least they got one. His sergeant came up to him, seeming to indicate that they had captured hundreds of bricks of cocaine down there. Guess the Contras would miss those, he thought."

 # CIA Contras
 CIA_CONTRA80.0.d:0 "THE CONTRAS IN NICARAGUA: IN BRIEF\nNicaragua Detachment, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the ongoing Nicaraguan Civil War, the United States has taken particular interest in a loose guerilla organization known as the “Contras” (short for “la contrarrevolución” or “the counterrevolution”, consisting of three major groups in Nicaragua focused on anti-communism and rebelling against the ruling Marxist-aligned government known as the Sandinistas or FSLN. The Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) is the largest Contra group, led by Adolfo Calero, composed of former Nicaraguan National Guardsmen and Fifteenth of September Legion. Other pro-Contra groups include Nicaraguans who were supportive of the anti-Somoza revolution but disapproved of the current Sandinista regime, including the Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas (MILPAS) and other peasant militia groups.\n\nThe United States is faced with a challenge in deciding whether to support the Contras. Current US support, mostly consisting of political support via exiles and limited weapons shipments, has not attracted much approval in Congress. This Office recommends further augmentation of arms shipments and other covert operations in Nicaragua, as it will properly advance American interests in the region and will enhance combat capability for the Contras. Significant concern should be placed on public opinion and Congressional opinion as continued troubles may necessitate ending operations."
 CIA_CONTRA80.1.d:0 "As morning fell on Washington, three of the most important men in the world and their aides were having an early meeting in the West Wing.\n\n“...and so, the Hill wants us to cut support to the Contras, and the President agrees, so we should move forward with ending it.” National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] sighed.\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] looked around. “I suppose. Just let it be known that there are individuals in the Agency that do not support this and support expanding aid shipments.”\n\nThe DDO broke in. “Congress doesn’t know anything about Nicaragua, yet they continue to order us to end something they don’t know about. Is there any way we can keep this on the downlow without having to read the President or Congress in?”\n\nThe National Security Advisor shook his head. “No way. We can’t afford to not let the President know about this, nor can Congress be lied to on such a scale such as this.”\n\n“An unusual opinion for you to have, there, boss,” the DDO said, “but I concede, you’re right. This situation, operationally, has become too complicated and one more fuck-up and it’ll be in the hands of the press. Better to end it now before we lose more credibility.” The other two nodded. “DCI, you start making the calls to the Watch Center and Langley. I’ll go read in the President right now, and tell him we’re ending arms shipments, but will continue limited public support for the contras in terms of rhetoric. Sounds good?” The National Security Advisor stood up.\n\n“Let’s end this.” The men nodded, then all walked out of the room."
 CIA_CONTRA80.2.d:0 "It was early evening, just after sunset, when Captain Thomas Glenn and his copilot, commanding a brand-new Lockheed L-100 Hercules, taxied onto runway 12 at Miami International Airport. It was his fourth or fifth flight working for this small cargo outfit called Southern Air Transport, which operated cargo flights between the United States and Central America. Specifically, Glenn and his copilot were tasked with flying this civilian version of a C-130 Hercules to Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras. His flight plan said PLA, as in Planadas, Colombia, but no one had to know the inconsistency there.\n\nTaking off a few short minutes later, Glenn sighed as he got ready for the generally straight and easy 2 hour flight to central Honduras. His copilot, also informally the loadmaster, came back from the cargo hold, reporting “all good, boss.”\n\nGlenn responded, “Do I even have clearance to know what’s back there?” They laughed, before the copilot responded, “Just boxes and boxes of AK-47s, a few boxes of Makarovs, a few TOWs, guess the Contras need those now.” Glenn nodded, moving back to the control area to adjust their heading slightly. “Yes, sir. I don’t care what I carry as long as it pays the bills, you know what I mean!” They laughed and continued to talk as the flight continued.\n\n90 minutes later, the L-100 touched down at Soto Cano at dusk, just as the pilots had left. Having a rather bumpy landing, Glenn was glad to see the cargo vehicles and US soldiers standing by the hangar, as the plane was wheeled back and parked to covertly unload. He would have just enough time to stretch his legs and grab some coffee, before refueling the bird and heading back to Miami, hopefully by 2 or 3 am Eastern. Then a day off, thank God.\n\nHe wondered where his cargo would go and how it would be used; he knew it was going to Nicaragua, but why Soviet weapons, he wondered? They were the ones fighting the Communists. Glenn wasn’t cleared enough to know where the arms were coming from, but he had done his job and it was time to head home."
 CIA_CONTRA80.3.d:0 "THE BOLAND AMENDMENT AND THE FUTURE OF NICARAGUA\nNicaragua Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; Office of Congressional Affairs, CIA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAn amendment to the most recent Defense Appropriations Act authored by Representative Edward Boland (D-MA) has caused great concern among members of the US Intelligence Community and the current administration. Having passed in the House by a wide margin, the “Boland Amendment” as it is known states the following:\n\n“During fiscal year [GetYear], no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual.”\n\nIn short, this Amendment effectively restricts not only the Central Intelligence Agency, but any US governmental body from financially supporting the Contras in Nicaragua. This move by Congress was not surprising by many Congressional Affairs officials, as the attitude on Capitol Hill has been firmly against the administration supporting anti-communist movements in Nicaragua, and particularly, by using funds authorized by them for other purposes.\n\nWe are faced with a variety of options in this regard. One would be simply following the text of the Amendment as stipulated by Congress, lest the CIA lose funding in later fiscal years. This has been pitched by senior members of the Agency and the Office of Congressional Affairs as a way for the CIA to save face and extricate itself from Nicaragua.\n\nHowever, the CIA General Counsel and the Directorate of Operations have advised the Agency that the Amendment has vague enough wording, that aid to the Contras could be continued covertly while technically remaining within Congressional stipulations. This would both please Congressional figures, while maintaining operational priorities in Nicaragua and supporting the Contras financially and militarily."
 CIA_CONTRA80.4.d:0 "“...Mr. President, we’d like to informally pressure the Hill to repeal the Boland Amendment via another House resolution.” White House Chief of Staff [GetCurrentCoS] motioned to a memo that had been placed on the Resolute Desk, where President [USA.GetLeader] sat.\n\nDirector for Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] nodded. “We’ve tossed it around at Langley and have decided that this is the best option to deal with our major opposition to the Contras in Congress.”\n\n“I see.” The President stated, looking back up at the two men. “The only issue lies in who we can contact that would be willing to author and sponsor it. The vote for the Boland Amendment was 411-0, nearly unanimous. The odds are not stacked in our favor, gentlemen.”\n\nThe two men nodded. “We’ve thought of that, Mr. President.” The Chief of Staff started in. “There are a few members that would be amiable to sponsoring a House resolution, including Congressman Newt Gingrich, from Georgia, who has been receptive to similar proposals in the past.”\n\n“Excellent work, men. Reach out to his office, tell him we need his help. He’s been a supporter on some of our issues before, so I think he’ll be amiable this time around.” They nodded again. “Yes, Mr. President.”"
 CIA_CONTRA80.5.d:0 "Unfortunate news has come from the Hill, as our supporters, including Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, have reported that the House of Representatives has essentially ignored a request by the White House to repeal the Boland Amendment, leaving it to die in committee controlled by anti-Contra members.\n\nThe attempt by the White House, trying to abide by the controversial Amendment but also trying to kill it, has been one in a series of failures by the administration to maintain a hold in Nicaragua without attracting the wrath of Congress. For its part, the Central Intelligence Agency has made a rare statement in which it has condemned Congress as “unjustly denying assistance to anti-Communist freedom fighters in Nicaragua without cause.”\n\nWith this development, it is unclear how the administration will proceed. Some sources have indicated that the CIA will continue their covert operations in Nicaragua in contravention of the Boland Amendment, while others have said they may simply end it here."
 CIA_CONTRA80.6.d:0 "ALTERNATIVES TO NICARAGUAN SUPPORT\nNicaragua Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nWith the ensuing approval of the Boland Amendment by the House of Representatives, effectively restricting CIA from spending funds or conducting operations in Nicaragua to support the Contras, the Agency has been struggling to find potential alternatives to continue to support operational and strategic objectives in Nicaragua and the surrounding region. Below are several proposals for alternative forms of maintaining operations:\n\n1. Establishing front or “shell” organizations, dummy corporations, or otherwise false companies, in order to shuttle aid and weapons through to the Contras, without actually spending any CIA-earmarked funds. This could take the form of air transport, shipping, or logistics companies, as well as aid and/or cultural organizations.\n\n2. Cooperating with the Western Goals Foundation, who is a private, non-governmental intelligence agency active with heavily similar anti-Communist goals and ideals. The Foundation, founded by Major General John Singlaub, also has the support of Congressman Larry McDonald, a strong supporter of our cause. This is nearly guaranteed to enable CIA to maintain operations while pinning the primary responsibility on Western Goals.\n\n3. A final alternative would be to discreetly sell weapons to Iran. By doing this, the United States would both free hostages taken by the Iranians, as well as build a greater strategic relationship with Iran. While this may be irrelevant to immediate interests, selling weapons to Iran will give the CIA funds which can be used to purchase Eastern Bloc weapons from an available market, which will then be used to provide the Contras with ammunition. This will operationally standardize the weapons being used in the conflict and ensure the Contras are better protected as they are not using Western weaponry.\n\nA combination of these proposals will ensure that the Nicaraguan Contras are not cut off from US support and aid; and while they technically violate the Boland Amendment, Congress has little enforcement power in this regard and will likely not notice covert activity unless it is made clear to them."
 CIA_CONTRA80.7.d:0 "At a warehouse outside Newport, Delaware, a new company was moving into its offices. The ink was barely dry on their incorporation agreement in the state of Delaware, a famously pro-business state that has simple laws for forming corporations; a moderately-sized, somewhat visible sign reading “INTER-AMERICA TRANSPORT CORPORATION” hung from the door. There were piles and piles of moving boxes, transport boxes, bankers’ boxes, all stashed about the office and warehouse area. Once they got the office set up, they would put the corporation’s phone number in the phone book so as not to attract suspicion, but the number would just happen to go to a call center in Kansas, where it would be dropped. This was no ordinary company.\n\nPulling off Interstate 95, a small, unassuming convoy of sedans, all black with tinted windows, parked in the parking lot outside the warehouse. It had been a long drive from Langley, but they were glad they didn’t have to fly. Getting out of the cars, they proceeded into the warehouse, looking at several stacked pallets filled with the cargo that the Corporation managed: instead of general cargo services, this “Inter-America Transport Corporation” smuggled arms. The men looked as a forklift came past them carrying a pallet of AK-47 rifles in crates, setting it down in the bay marked “TO CONTRAS.”\n\nThis unassuming warehouse, located near a chemical plant and in an industrial zone in northern Delaware, would soon be one of the largest arms transfer points in the entire Western Hemisphere. From here, US weapons would be shipped to Iran via ship, exchanged for prisoners which were freed publicly, and paid for in American dollars which were then used to procure Eastern Bloc weapons from reputable dealers behind the Curtain and in Africa. Those weapons would be sent back to Delaware, where soon, they would board an L-100 plane or small boat to be sent to Nicaragua to help freedom fighters everywhere. And the best part? All of this was classified to everyone but the most senior officials and flight personnel, all under the watchful and ignorant gaze of Congress."
 CIA_CONTRA80.8.d:0 "THE WESTERN GOALS FOUNDATION AND COOPERATION\nNicaragua Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe Western Goals Foundation (WGF), an anti-communist and domestic security and intelligence think tank, has been particularly active in the past few years and has attracted the attention of CIA senior officials as being potentially useful in some operations, including, but not limited to, Iran and Nicaragua. Below are prominent WGF officials and founders, as well as proposals for collaboration with the United States Intelligence Community.\n\n1. WGF Founder, Major General John Singlaub, has been known to the CIA as a founding member of the Agency, as well as a decorated World War II veteran who worked with French Resistance groups during and after D-Day. Singlaub served briefly as chief of staff for US Forces Korea, before retiring and forming the Western Goals Foundation with Congressman Larry McDonald (see below). Singlaub carries much influence in US intelligence circles and is a member of the United States Council for World Freedom, a similarly-identifying anti-Communist organization.\n\n2. Congressman Lawrence (Larry) McDonald (Democratic, Georgia’s 7th district) is also one of the WGF’s key founders and benefactors. McDonald has been in the US House of Representatives since the 1974 congressional elections, and has maintained one of the most conservative and anti-Communist voting records in that body thus far. McDonald has heavily supported CIA activities in the past and his support will likely continue, as well as maintaining a line into Congress to use to advance intelligence interests.\n\nWe believe that with the assistance of these two figures, that cooperation between CIA and Western Goals will allow a more “legitimate” form of sending aid to Nicaraguan Contra forces, as opposed to other alternatives. Western Goals is composed of former military and intelligence officials, all of whom understand the complexities of the situation at present. Cooperation should begin immediately."
 CIA_CONTRA80.9.d:0 "It was a cold night in the city of Dogubeyazit, Turkey, as a convoy of trucks passed through on Turkish state road D.100, heading east, having completely crossed the country from the western city of Izmir, specifically Cigli Air Base.\n\nAs they rumbled on, hurtling towards the Iranian border, the trucks pulled off at the village of Gurbulak, the last stop before the border. They were never going to cross, and, sitting in a vacant lot just outside the village, the drivers waited for a near-identical set of trucks, also unmarked, to approach the rendezvous point.\n\nLangley had suggested that they meet in a more populated place in order to make the deal go through, but the Chief of Station in Ankara had suggested rural Turkey near the border at night so as not to attract more attention. The operatives, all drivers, had decided to go through with that, and as they sat, they saw six heavy-duty trucks approaching from the Iranian border checkpoint, with a staff vehicle in front. Seeing them approach, the operatives got out, lighting up cigarettes and beginning to drop the tailgates and open the doors of their trucks. A few stood around with rifles for area protection, while the rest got ready.\n\nThere was little talk if anything; most of the details had been planned ahead of time by senior officials on both sides. In return for 20 BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles, the Iranians would pay approximately $500,000 in cash, American dollars. The operatives did not know where they got that from, but they would get the missiles. As they watched, an Iranian officer, not in uniform, set two briefcases, full of the cash, down on the ground, and while it was being looked over, the missiles, in their crates, began to be unloaded and moved to the Iranian trucks.\n\nIt was truly that simple. The senior operative, the lead driver, asked if the Iranians knew how to operate the TOW missiles. The officer said yes, and that was that. The operatives had their cash, and the Chief of Station in Ankara would have another encrypted dispatch to send to Langley in the morning; with the cash in a diplomatic bag, of course."
 CIA_CONTRA80.10.d:0 "THE HOSTAGES FOR WEAPONS PROBLEM: PROPOSAL\nIran and Lebanon Desks, Office of Near East Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; Directorate of Operations\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the midst of the ensuing Lebanon crisis and civil war, the United States has been embroiled in trying to mediate a crisis of its own in the region; seven Americans, out of an estimated one hundred total hostages, taken by the Hezbollah terrorist group in Lebanon. US intelligence has determined that Hezbollah continues to be politically and financially backed by the new fundamentalist Islamic Republic of Iran, who itself is involved in a bloody conflict with its southern neighbor of Iraq.\n\nThe Iran and Lebanon Desks, with some outside counsel, have proposed a plan to both retain Iran within the Western sphere of influence while also freeing the American hostages in the process. With the assistance of Manucher Ghorbanifar, a former Iranian weapons dealer, the United States will propose the sales of weaponry to Iran to accomplish the following:\n\n1. The sale of TOW and HAWK anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles will provide a profit of funds that, outside of the Boland Amendment’s stipulated budgetary restrictions, can be used for funding the Nicaraguan Contras and other groups which the United States would like to support but faces opposition from the public or Congress on.\n\n2. In exchange for providing the missiles, Iran will be compelled to issue a guarantee that the hostages will be released by Hezbollah, as they have significant enough influence and support to call shots on Hezbollah operations, particularly if they are contingent on US arms sales.\n\n3. Finally, providing the Iranians with weapons will allow them to become more militarily dependent on us, will prevent the Iranian government from pursuing arms sales from the Soviet Bloc, and will allow them a minor tactical advantage in the ensuing Iran-Iraq War.\n\nWe believe that this proposal, conducted in an extremely covert manner, will provide benefits for nearly all parties involved: the United States will receive further influence and the return of hostages which will be a benefit to the current administration; Iran will receive weapons that it needs to enhance its capability; and the Contras will receive funding that is coming from arms sales profits to Iran."
 CIA_CONTRA80.11.d:0 "Via covert channels, operatives of the US Central Intelligence Agency have made a crucial offer to our government. Currently, seven Americans are being held hostage in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a group that we support politically, militarily, and financially. The White House, in its attempt to recover from the disaster it saw in the 1979 Iranian Revolution, is trying to recover those hostages and save face domestically as well as internationally.\n\nCIA operatives have offered to provide weapons to Iran, such as BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles and HAWK surface-to-air missiles, if we can guarantee and facilitate the release of all seven Americans.\n\nMembers of our government and of the Revolutionary Guard Corps remain split on the issue. Keeping the hostages may provide greater leverage in the future, while the immediate concern militarily is increasing our capabilities in the midst of our war with Iraq, and using American equipment would provide a tactical advantage as opposed to receiving weapons and aid from the Soviet bloc. How should we choose?"
 CIA_CONTRA80.12.d:0 "Sources from Tehran have reached back to our operatives with an acceptance that Iran will release all seven American hostages upon receiving an “adequate number” of TOW and HAWK missiles. While numbers are yet to be determined, and this remains a covert operation, not to be seen by the eyes of the public or Congress, this represents a major victory for the United States in its relations with the new, Islamist Iranian regime.\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] have been informed and expect to brief President [USA.GetLeader] on the developments shortly."
 CIA_CONTRA80.13.d:0 "Sources from Tehran have reached back to our operatives with an explicit rejection of any “arms-for-hostages” offer by the United States. While not providing a public statement as would be expected by the anti-American Islamist fundamentalist Iranian regime, the Iranians have rejected any such offers, appearing dead set on keeping the seven American hostages for greater leverage on issues later on. Despite the clear need for weaponry in the wake of the Iran-Iraq War, it is curious that the Iranians would reject such high-tech missiles in their time of need.\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir] and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] have been informed and expect to brief President [USA.GetLeader] on the developments shortly."
 CIA_CONTRA80.15.d:0 "A STRATEGIC UNDERSTANDING WITH IRAN?\nIran Desk, Office of Near Eastern Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBased on the United States’ more recent interactions with the new Iranian government after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, there are indications that a new strategic understanding may be desired in order to cement Iran as a country closely allied with American goals in the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamist fundamentalist regime, since 1979, has struggled to reinvent its image and reputation on the world stage, and according to recent analyses, is in dire threat of being absorbed into the Soviet sphere of influence. Their current conflict with their southern neighbor, Iraq, also threatens to further destabilize Iran as well as remain destabilizing to most of the Middle Eastern region. Having been willing to engage with US operatives and officials surrounding the Lebanese hostage issue and proposed weapons sales, this Desk believes proposing a draft strategic understanding with the Iranian regime will present a warming up in US-Iranian relations as well as protect the country from being absorbed by Soviet influence. The understanding should include the following:\n\n1. The United States will consider diplomatically recognizing the Islamic Republic of Iran if the government accedes to returning all foreign hostages, formally apologizing for their actions against US Embassy officials in 1979, and issues diplomatic protests against Soviet and Eastern Bloc diplomatic personnel.\n\n2. The United States, in addition to recognizing the Islamic Republic of Iran, will then consider limited humanitarian, economic, and military aid to enhance Iranian economic production and military capability, as well as to provide for the people of Iran, if the Iranian government agrees to considering negotiations with Iraqi government officials, as well as domestic reforms with less strict religious guidance.\n\n3. If the Islamic Republic of Iran refuses to return hostages, diplomatically expel Soviet officials, negotiate with Iraq, or consider domestic reforms, the United States will not provide recognition or aid in any form, beginning with weapons shipments.\n\nWe urge the cooperation of the Department of State in this regard but recommend that all negotiations on this strategic understanding should be done covertly for the moment to avoid any political blowback from possible failures."
 CIA_CONTRA80.16.d:0 "American officials, under the guise of the Central Intelligence Agency, have approached some of our diplomats and senior government officials to propose a new shift in US-Iranian relations, termed as a “strategic understanding.”\n\nThe Americans have proposed diplomatically recognizing our government and restarting limited diplomatic relations if our government agrees to release all foreign hostages, apologize for the US Embassy siege in 1979, and issue diplomatic protests against Soviet embassy personnel, who they are concerned are attempting to influence our government.\n\nThe Americans are also offering aid, primarily military and humanitarian assistance, if our government further agrees to begin negotiating with Iraq, who we are in a bitter conflict with, as well as consider domestic reforms to remove strict religious rules in our society. The Americans have made clear that if we do not accede, aid will not be provided, nor will diplomatic recognition.\n\nFigures in our government remain divided on the issue. More hardline members of our government continually argue that acceding to the Americans would defeat the entire point of the Revolution and that the “Great Satan” will rule over us again. However, some moderates have argued that what the US is providing is amenable and will help to rebuild some of the country’s image. How shall we choose?"
 CIA_CONTRA80.17.d:0 "Response has come back from Tehran indicating that the hardliners in the Iranian government have rejected all attempts at a strategic reorientation with the United States.\n\nDespite our rather hefty promises of diplomatic recognition and weapons aid, the Iranians have not taken well the demands that they release hostages, negotiate with Iraq, and pursue domestic reforms. Rather than issuing a private demarche, the Iranians issued a statement condemning our actions as “another attempt by the Great Satan, the United States of America, to interfere in our internal affairs and bring the entire Middle East region under its hegemony.” It appears as if the Iranians are moving towards the Soviet bloc of influence although information on that is not completely known.\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir], National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], and White House Chief of Staff [GetCurrentCoS] have all been briefed and are angrily preparing to brief President [USA.GetLeader] and Vice President [GetCurrentVP] at this very moment."

In exchange, the United States has agreed to diplomatically recognize the Islamic Republic, at least beginning a true warming in diplomatic relations.\n\nSecretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], Director of Central Intelligence [GetCurrentCIADir], and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] have been briefed on the developments, and expect to brief the President and Vice President as soon as possible."
 CIA_CONTRA80.19.d:0 "In Miami, the L-100 landed again. Glenn rubbed his eyes as he taxied, checking his watch. It was two in the morning and he had just gotten back from Honduras. He was ready for bed and a few days off. God damn.\n\nA thousand miles away and a few hours later, the sun rose over the White House Chief of Staff’s office window. Not only did [GetCurrentCoS] sit there, sipping coffee, but so did DCI [GetCurrentCIADir] and National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv]. Their conversation was perfectly ordinary. Every time a cargo flight returned, they were told. Just down the corridor, in the Oval, sat the President and the Vice President, going over their agendas for the day. Perfectly ordinary, as all things should be.\n\nOnly a few hours drive up Interstate 95, the warehouse in Newport, Delaware was similarly buzzing. Tractor-trailers from the Northeast had just arrived, full of newly procured AK-47s and other Soviet Bloc weapons; and within an hour, those same trucks, now filled with M-16s and TOW missiles, were back on the road to different ports, this time in the South. Different trucks would come later to take the Soviet weapons down to Miami, where they’d be flown in.\n\nThousands of miles to the south, a Contra unit was just waking up after getting a few hours of sleep after nighttime operations. Loading back up, they were in the vicinity of a higher command headquarters, so decided to check in. To their surprise, they saw new crates that must have been brought in by the Hondurans. Grabbing the new weapons and ammunition, the commander knew his squad would be happy by this.\n\nIt was a massive and large system, but one that remained secret."
 CIA_CONTRA80.20.d:0 "“FUCK!” The DCI, [GetCurrentCIADir] yelled into the wide open air of his office, looking down at both the briefings on his desk and the newspaper open in front of him, turned to a large article on “WEAPONS TRAFFICKING IN DELAWARE REVEALED.”\n\nPicking up the phone, he dialed the National Security Advisor’s office, immediately being patched in. [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] picked up. “Hello?”\n\n“Have you READ the Washington Post this morning? We are so fucked. They found the warehouse in Delaware. Soon, they’re gonna figure out the plane and ship routes, all of the documentation there mentions the vessels.”\n\n“Fuck. We need to try damage control. Get State on the phone, we’ll start issuing statements about our commitment to weapons enforcement as well as the Contras and begin an FBI investigation. Tell everyone at Southern Air Transport they may be next. Stop flights until it blows over. Tell someone to get the Iranians on the horn, and we need to tell the Contras so they’re not mad.”\n\n“Okay. Fuck, man, this is bad. You need to brief the President now. Make sure he doesn’t make it worse. Christ, this is going to be a long day.”"

Repeal of the Amendment will allow the CIA, as well as other intelligence agencies and departments, to continue their operations supporting Contra forces to advance US interests.\n\nRepresentative Gingrich, who spearheaded the repeal in the House, has received congratulations and thanks from President [USA.GetLeader] for his work, and is expected to be used in the future by administration officials to advance other pieces of legislation or repeals."
 CIA_CONTRA80.22.d:0 "As the L-100 touched down at Soto Cano for the first time in more than a few weeks, Captain Thomas Glenn sighed, moving the control stick to taxi to his usual hangar out of sight. He was glad to be back after a long (and unpaid) vacation, but this flight was very routine for him at this point.\n\nHaving parked the aircraft, Glenn got out, watching as his copilot, the loadmaster, walked out the back ramp, clipboard in hand, talking to the US and Honduran soldiers standing there, checking. Glenn walked over, nodding to the men, passing them to see if the American detachment’s executive officer (XO) was in his small corner of an “office.”\n\nThe XO was a major, deputy commander of give or take, a hundred men assigned to the base as security, liaison with the Hondurans, and aircraft handling. There was more than just this company, in fact, a Special Warfare Training Center at Soto Cano supporting Joint Task Force Bravo, the higher command here in Honduras. He sipped at some coffee as he continued to page through some reports, as Glenn walked into his office.\n\n“Howdy, Major.” Glenn cracked a smile, “saluting” with two fingers to his old, beat-up Baltimore Orioles baseball cap. “How’s the party at Soto Cano? You know I haven’t been down here in a few weeks.”\n\n“It’s been chaotic to say the least. We’ve had senior Contras show up demanding weapons and my men have had to send them away because the idiots in Washington stopped shipments out of the blue.”\n\nGlenn nodded. “Yeah, I know, those assholes in Congress put me out of a job for a couple weeks. Can’t say Southern Air Transport doesn’t take care of its own though. I managed to hang on.” He set down the cargo manifest. “Here’s your first shipment. I assume we need to be turned around and out of here within, say, 3 hours?\n\n“Yeah, Tom.” The major looked down at the manifest. “Wow, nice. Plenty of AK-47s, some RPGs, some anti-personnel mines. I assume the larger craft are coming with vehicles soon? That’s what the brass has indicated to me.”\n\nGlenn shrugged. “I have no idea. SAT is very independently structured. I suppose they don’t even want me to know what I’m carrying myself, much less what other flights are bringing in.”\n\nThe major frowned. “Okay. Well, welcome back. Get yourself a cup of coffee and a snack and we’ll have the plane unloaded within the hour.” He smiled and nodded, as Glenn waved and exited the office, seeing the soldiers unloading the crates of guns."
 CIA_CONTRA80.23.d:0 "It was early morning as the Danish-flagged freighter MS Erria slowly moored itself to a pier at the port of Puerto Cortes, on the northern Caribbean coast of Honduras, fresh from a long voyage from the port of Cherbourg, France.\n\nIts crew was tired; most of them were Danish merchant mariners, but a few were Americans, presumably serving as liaisons, but on the payroll of Langley. The Erria was only about 150 feet long, and the seas of the Atlantic had not been kind to her. They were glad to be finally stopped.\n\nTheir final destination, at least this voyage, was to be Wilmington, North Carolina, but they had a stop here for another reason. The manifest said they were carrying bananas and other agricultural products up to the US, but the cargo they were offloading was unclear. In the hold of the freighter, as well as in small shipping containers, held what they thought were vehicles. None of the crew knew, and they would likely never find out. Not even the captain knew.\n\nSome Honduran soldiers appeared, evidently a small detachment from the harbor patrol. Having inspected the freighter, and looking in the containers, they went to go speak to the first mate, one of the suspicious-looking Americans that had been with them for months.\n\nAfter a brief chat, the soldiers started directing the Danes, having them lift what they could carry or otherwise using forklifts to take the crates off the ship and placing them on a loading dock. Soon, a truck would come to haul it to a nearby army base where the crates would be unpacked and assembled.\n\nOne of the sailors, taking a moment after using the forklift heavily, stopped to take a look at the shipping manifest again. The cargo to Puerto Cortes said “RENAULT AUTOMOBILE,” but he knew that was not what was in those containers.\n\nAfter loading, the soldiers met with the American again, shaking hands and signing off on a new piece of paper, one that the Danes hadn’t seen before. As the sailors got busy again reloading the ship with bananas, they noticed one of the crates being opened by a squad of Honduran soldiers. Inside was a jeep. There were also smaller crates, full of tube-looking items, marked STINGER on the side. Curious."

A major operation was about to happen, and as he checked his watch, his men began to follow their orders.\n\nAt five minutes after one in the afternoon, almost throughout the country, things began to explode. A few sections of the Nicaraguan highway system, some containing packed buses, collapsed. Docks at the ports of San Juan del Sur and Puerto Cabezas just happened to sink into the sea. The few remaining trains on the barely-used Nicaraguan railway network slowed to a stop as their engineers noticed the rails had been blown to bits in front of them. Various government buildings in Managua, including the headquarters of the Nicaraguan Army, were also bombed.\n\nAnd just like that, the saboteurs disappeared into the night, into the jungle, not to be seen by anyone but other Contras and their CIA handlers. The commander sat in his bunker, tuned to the FSLN-controlled Radio Sandino, listening for news. The country and government were panicking now. Excellent."

 # CIA Condor - Dirty War
 CIA_CONDOR.0.d:0 "OPERATION CONDOR: OPERATIONAL SUMMARY\nOffice of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations, CIA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nOperation Condor, also known as Plan Condor, is in brief, a cooperative effort by the intelligence and security services of several South American countries to combat terrorism and subversion region-wide.\n\nComposed mainly of Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia, Condor has the stated goal of counterinsurgency operations on a transnational scale, in particular with intelligence cooperation by the Argentinian Secretaría de Informaciones de Estado (SIDE) and the Chilean Direction de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). Condor has received support from CIA and DIA in the past, as well as military support from USSOUTHCOM in its military component, which involves liaison and communication services between the military regimes.\n\nCondor was initially formed in the early 1970s, formalized in 1975 in Santiago, Chile; and began covert operations later that year. Some operations, having been reported to us by Condor members, have included surveillance of Chilean and Uruguayan dissidents, assassination of a pro-Allende Chilean General Carlos Prats and his wife, as well as Chilean Christian Democratic leader Bernardo Leighton. CIA station chiefs in Santiago, Brasilia, and Montevideo have been instrumental in conducting liaison, training, and advisory services for Condor intelligence agencies, military services, and police agencies.\n\nStated US policy from Foggy Bottom and Langley has always been to act with Condor in a limited training and advisory capacity, but not to directly engage in covert operations, leaving that to Condor members. The United States has maintained and will continue to maintain plausible deniability with its involvement in Condor operations and the use of US facilities to support Condor members, such as in training and communications support."
 CIA_CONDOR.1.d:0 "COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA\nArgentina Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations, CIA; EMBASSY BUENOS AIRES\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBeginning in mid-1974 under the former government of Isabel Peron, widow of the late President, Juan Peron, counterinsurgency operations in Argentina have been ongoing as of the writing of this report. Despite the 1976 coup d’etat by the Argentine military, which established the National Reorganization Process, operations continue, and appear to be marginally more effective than in prior years.\n\nPrimarily countering left-wing guerrillas, including the People’s Revolutionary Army (ERP), Peronist Monteneros, trade unionist movements, and pro-Allende Chilean exiles; the “Dirty War” as the Argentine military calls it, involves nearly all security services; including the military, Federal Police, the Secretaría de Informaciones de Estado (SIDE), and a pro-junta paramilitary known as the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina (AAA).\n\nCurrent US policy has dictated support for the National Reorganization Process as part of a wide-ranging anti-communist policy in Latin America. However, some officials in Langley and Foggy Bottom have expressed concern about overly supporting the Argentine military, particularly with their involvement in Operation Condor with other South American countries. A change in policy may be required in order to temper American interests and desires in South America in the future."
 CIA_CONDOR.2.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, a spokesperson for the Department of State confirmed today that the United States would, effective as of today, “end all support for the Argentine National Reorganization Process” in its entirety, citing numerous human rights violations committed by the ruling Argentine military junta.\n\nCiting illegal transnational killings and other atrocities against its own citizens as part of an alleged operation known as “Operation Condor,” the United States has taken an abrupt about-face on its policy in the region. It is unclear whether similar condemnations will come down for Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, and other South American military dictatorships, but this development remains particularly significant, especially in Buenos Aires."
 CIA_CONDOR.3.d:0 "Unfortunate news has appeared from the US Embassy to Argentina that the White House and Pentagon jointly have agreed to end support for paramilitaries that we have used in our fight against the left-wing and communist menace. In their statement, the Embassy mentioned “concern over the use of the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina in military operations” as well as various claims of human rights abuses by the military, AAA and other pro-junta paramilitaries.\n\nThis is an entirely unexpected development from Washington, who in the past has pushed for more anti-communist counterinsurgency activity and has covertly provided assistance via intelligence and military liaisons as well as via the Condor system."
 CIA_CONDOR.4.d:0 "Unfortunate news has appeared from the US Embassy to Chile that the White House and Pentagon have jointly agreed to end support for paramilitaries that we have utilized in our fight against pro-Allende and left-wing communist guerrillas in the country.

 CIA_CONDOR.5.d:0 "Today, in a surprising statement, US Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] and Attorney General [GetCurrentAG] jointly announced their combined effort to bring Nazi war criminals hiding in South America to justice, via an Interagency Task Force, which will be responsible for seeking out, negotiating, and arresting Nazi officials residing in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and other South American countries; including infamous figures as Klaus Barbie, Sandor Kepiro, Erich Priebke, and Dinko Sakic.\n\nThere has been no reaction from the military regimes in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile yet, but it is expected that the Americans will face much resistance, as the military governments have agreed to hide and protect former Nazis. It is expected that the White House will seek to extradite individuals, either for trial in the United States or in an international court."
 CIA_CONDOR.6.d:0 "COLLABORATION WITH FORMER NAZI OFFICIALS IN SOUTH AMERICA\nArgentina Desk, Office of Latin American Operations, Directorate of Operations; US Defense Attache, EMBASSY BUENOS AIRES\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs a focus on counterinsurgency operations in the Southern Cone has been stressed in recent years as the highest priority in US policy in South America, there has been some discussion in both American intelligence circles and in the agencies of South American Condor members (Argentine SIDE, Chilean DINA) about the possible cooptation and cooperation opportunities from former Nazi officials living in South America.\n\nTherefore, Argentina Desk, with the support of Embassy Buenos Aires and the Defense Attache’s office, submits the following proposals for prominent Nazi officials in the Southern Cone that could be contacted and used for operational goals:\n\n1. Klaus Barbie, known as the “Butcher of Lyon,” heavily responsible for atrocities against the French Resistance during the Second World War; was briefly a member of US Army Counterintelligence, who helped him escape to Bolivia. He is currently on the payroll of the West German intelligence service (BND) and is heavily involved in the ruling Bolivian military government. In that role, Barbie has allegedly participated in the hunting down of Che Guevara. His influence in the Bolivian government and experience with counterinsurgency makes him a prime candidate for cooperation.\n\n2. Erich Priebke, a mid-level SS police commander during the Second World War who was responsible for a massacre in Rome in March 1944 that left 335 Italian civilians dead. Priebke was scheduled for trial but managed to escape a British prison camp in Italy, and is currently living in Bariloche, Argentina, under an assumed name. Priebke was commonly known as a competent commander and could be used by allied forces to support police activities in the region.\n\n3. Dinko Sakic, a Croatian Ustase official, who was the commander of the Jasenovac concentration camp in occupied Yugoslavia, was an open Nazi collaborator, and fled to Argentina, then to Paraguay in the late 1940s. He is a known friend of Paraguayan leader General Alfredo Stroessner, and has emerged as a leader of the small Croat emigre community in Paraguay and the region. His experience with internment camps, as well as heavy anti-communist orientation, makes him a perfect candidate for cooperation, particularly in Paraguay.\n\nThe Embassy in Buenos Aires and this Desk believes that these three men, properly found and contacted, should provide further benefits to US involvement in South America, as well as benefits to the Condor system in the Southern Cone."
 CIA_CONDOR.7.d:0 "Terrible news has come from the US Ambassador, who arrived with a team at La Casa Rosada today to inform the Argentine military government that the United States would, effective immediately, terminate all support with the Argentine Republic. Concern apparently has been raised in Washington and has circulated among the White House, Foggy Bottom, and Langley, about the scope and depth of US cooperation with our government, particularly as it relates to covert support and counterinsurgency support in our ongoing anti-Communist operations.\n\nThis has sparked heavy backlash from prominent officers within our government, who allege that the National Reorganization Process has gone too far in its internal operations as well as its participation in Condor. Many officers, even those who received military training and schooling in the United States, have condemned Washington for its insolence in this matter, and urges the Embassy to reconsider its statement. However, it appears as if the Argentine Armed Forces will receive US support no longer, unless we can convince the Americans to take us back."
 CIA_CONDOR.8.d:0 "In an unsurprising statement from Washington today, US Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], joined by National Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv], reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Argentine military government, officially known as the National Reorganization Process.\n\nReiterating the “commitment of the United States to assist Argentina in combating insurgency and transnational security challenges,” the Secretary of State confirmed to the world open US involvement in Southern American affairs, all but providing a blank check to the Argentine junta to continue their brutal counterinsurgency campaign."
 CIA_CONDOR.9.d:0 "Fortunate news has come from Washington today, as US Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] confirmed publicly the United States’ continuing support for the Argentine military government. An additional statement and phone call from the US Embassy in Buenos Aires to La Casa Rosada reiterated this fact, with the American Ambassador sending his warmest regards and stating that the defense attache would be pleased to have further contacts with his colleagues in the Argentine Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nMembers of our government are pleased by this announcement, but some wonder why the United States had to revisit its policy positions on the matter? Some military intelligence officers within our government, particularly those in SIDE, have postulated that the White House may have considered pulling support but was convinced by members of the CIA, Department of Defense, and other influential national security agencies. However, regardless, we accept this development with open arms."

 CIA_PERU.0.d:0 "INSURGENCY IN PERU: THE SHINING PATH\nPeru Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence, CIA; Defense Attache, EMBASSY LIMA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nSince 1980, the northeastern South American country of Peru has been terrorized by an ongoing insurgency in the rural areas that has involved the full deployment of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Known as Sandero Luminoso, or “Shining Path,” the insurgency is mostly composed of Maoist guerrillas independent of the Communist Party of Peru, which is Marxist-Leninist in its orientation.\n\nFounded in 1969 by Abimael Guzman, known to the Peruvian population as “Chairman Gonzalo,” Shining Path began its campaign of terror during the 1980 elections, burning ballot boxes and then escalating to full-scale violence and terror, mostly concentrated in the Andean Highland provinces of Ayacucho, Apurimac, and Huancavelica.\n\nPeruvian government response to the insurgency began as middling, but emergency zones were formed in recent years, giving the Armed Forces near total control over local governance and the power of arbitrary detainment. However, these actions have not been enough. Shining Path has conducted several sabotage operations on high-level infrastructure, including cutting power to the capital of Lima and setting bombs near government buildings. Prominent Peruvian politicians and military personnel have also been assassinated, including the Chairman of the National Electoral Council, as well as left-wing and Marxist figures who opposed Shining Path.\n\nUS officials in Peru have expressed deep concern at the Peruvian government’s response as yet and have been pushing for deeper US support. Langley has determined several possibilities, including expanding security assistance for the Peruvian Armed Forces as well as directly undercutting Shining Path’s popular support in the Andean rural areas."
 CIA_PERU.1.d:0 "PERU’S MILITARY: CAPABILITIES AND POTENTIAL FOR MODERNIZATION\nPeru Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, CIA; Defense Attache, EMBASSY LIMA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe Peruvian Armed Forces, in recent years, have proven themselves one of the most tactically superior militaries in the Andean region, if not the wider South American region. Peru’s past reliance on Soviet weaponry and aid, however, has dramatically weakened modernization efforts, particularly with its ongoing counterinsurgency campaign against the “Shining Path” Communist guerrilla group. Defense Attache and Embassy Lima see a possible opportunity in this case to begin further US support as the Peruvians are vulnerable and open to more modern equipment from the West.\n\n1. The Peruvian Army is heavily interested in receiving more US military aid, primarily predicated on dissatisfaction with Soviet logistics and perceived Western technological superiority. Current deals include a $110 million deal for the Army to receive 15 UH-60 Blackhawk assault/transport helicopters, which would replace aging Mi-8 helicopters. Army officers have also indicated interest in purchasing up to 50 M60A3 main battle tanks, as part of a counterbalance against Chilean purchases of tanks from France and Israel. Up to 200 M113 armored personnel carriers have also been considered for sale.\n\n2. The Peruvian Navy has an impressive capability for South American navies, but has suffered recently from antiquated vessels, lack of missile systems, and little to no aviation capability. The Navy has been in the process of acquiring Lupo-class frigates from Italy, as well as several SH-3 maritime helicopters from us; but is seeking more air assets, including S-2 maritime patrol planes and missiles, as well as older-model LST’s to support marine amphibious operations.\n\n3. The Peruvian Air Force has a variety of combat aircraft and holds the distinction of being the third-largest air force in South America, but seeks to expand its counterinsurgency, close air support, and transport capabilities by acquiring Bell 214T helicopters, civilian-branded L-100-30 transport aircraft (C-130s), and possibly, the newest A-10 Thunderbolt CAS aircraft.\n\nIn conclusion, all branches of the Peruvian Armed Forces have indicated a desire for Western, if not exclusively American, weaponry. Having experience in counterinsurgency, we should provide weaponry and support to Peru for them to accomplish their goals."
 CIA_PERU.2.d:0 "FIREARM LAWS IN PERU: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM\nPeru Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence, CIA; Defense Attache, EMBASSY LIMA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nRecent increases in insurgency activity, by both the Maoist “Shining Path” (Sandero Luminoso) and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have nearly exhausted the Peruvian Government’s conventional military capabilities. Intelligence has indicated that the Valle de los Rios Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro (VRAEM) region, with an indigenous-majority population, has wide Shining Path support, with any resistance being hampered by oppressive firearm laws.\n\nFirearm laws in Peru have been conservative since the Colonial Spanish period, in particular targeting indigenous Inca people, whom the Spanish feared would resist against their colonial ambitions. However, the law has remained, essentially preventing rural communities, most of whom are indigenous, to defend themselves against Communist threats.\n\nEmbassy Lima and the Defense Attache have proposed pressuring the Peruvian Government to repeal its firearms law, on the basis that it would allow indigenous communities to form anti-communist or anti-Sandero Luminoso militias and autonomous defense organizations (known locally as “rondas campesinas” or “peasant rounds”). These organizations would greatly benefit Peruvian government forces in their ongoing counterinsurgency campaign, as local units appear to be marginally more effective as shown in other conflicts.\n\nPreliminary intelligence from sources within the Peruvian Government indicate that a repeal of firearms laws has wide support among both the legislature and the military; intelligence on the indigenous community has also indicated some degree of willingness to contribute to counterinsurgency operations, but on the basis of further reforms to support indigenous populations."
 CIA_PERU.3.d:0 "SANDERO LUMINOSO SUPPORT IN RURAL PERU: OPPORTUNITIES & ANALYSIS\nPeru Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence, CIA; Defense Attache, EMBASSY LIMA\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nIn the midst of Peru’s ongoing insurgency, particular attention has been paid by intelligence sources to the rural Valle de los Rios Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro region, in the Andes Mountains, as a location to focus on in combating the Sandero Luminoso (Shining Path, or SL) Maoist guerrilla movement. SL support has been high in this region, being home to a high indigenous Inca and Quechua population who have been largely ignored and marginalized by the central government in Lima.\n\nEmbassy Lima and the Defense Attache believes that undercutting SL support in this region, via pressuring the Peruvian government for reforms and systematic changes in counterinsurgency tactics, will shift the momentum from supporting SL to the Peruvian government.\n\n1. Legal reforms may be preferable to the indigenous population, as Inca, Quechua, and other “Amerindians” are legally separate from other ethnic groups and therefore, have different legal rights. Legal reforms may also include additional autonomy in local government and language legislation to allow more flexibility in native languages.\n\n2. Rural land reforms are a definite recommendation to the Peruvian government in gaining support from indigenous groups. Current SL levels of support exist because of rhetoric about exploitation of indigenous land and the central government being out of touch with indigenous needs. Land reform could include additional decentralization initiatives, local indigenous cooperatives as have been done previously, and subsidies for agriculture.\n\n3. Militarily, pressuring the Peruvian Armed Forces for more comprehensive rules of engagement are extremely necessary. Much SL support also comes from Peruvian government actions which have resulted in deaths of civilians, mostly revenge killings and other atrocities, due to a lack of rules of engagement with counterinsurgency operations. The Defense Attache recommends further pressuring of Peruvian generals via threatening to withhold aid to accomplish this goal.\n\nBy effectively communicating these desires to the Peruvian Government, and beginning a civil action campaign with the indigenous population, the tide of public opinion should begin to turn against the Sandero Luminoso guerrillas and assure greater operability for Peruvian government forces."
 CIA_PERU.4.d:0 "The Legal Attache at the US Embassy in Lima has come to us via the Minister of Justice with an urgent proposal on legal reforms that our government can implement in the indigenous-majority Andean departments. According to the Attache’s office, these proposals include extension of further autonomy to indigenous groups for local government, changing legal definitions and rights of the Inca and Quechua peoples, and extending language protections in those areas.\n\nSome members of our government have expressed support, arguing that acceding to the indigenous community, most of whom constitute the bulk of Sandero Luminoso (SL) support, would cause them to turn against the SL and towards our government. However, some conservative military officers and other government officials remain skeptical, arguing that now is not the time to extend reforms to a violent and lawless area of the country where operations are taking place. How shall we respond?"
 CIA_PERU.5.d:0 "The Legal Attache to the US Embassy in Lima has reported that the Peruvian Government has acceded to his proposal for comprehensive legal reforms focused on the indigenous community. The Peruvian Minister of Justice, in a phone call with the Ambassador and Legal Attache, confirmed this and told them that they would move to restore autonomous local government to Inca and Quechua communities via executive decree, but that legislation surrounding language and further legal rights would take time in the Congress of the Republic.\n\nThe attitude in the Peruvian Government is seen to be positive by this, with the hope being that the indigenous community will begin to turn to the central government and against the Sandero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla group. Attitudes in Langley and at Foggy Bottom are also positive, with the hope that the intended reforms will actually succeed as proposed."
 CIA_PERU.6.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Legal Attache at the US Embassy in Lima has reported that the Peruvian Government has rejected his proposal for legal reforms of the indigenous community in the Andean Highlands. Originally proposed as a way to influence indigenous peoples to support the central government in Lima instead of the Sandero Luminoso, the reforms were quickly denied as “not timely nor necessary in the face of a national emergency from Communist terrorists,” according to the Peruvian Minister of Justice in a statement.\n\nBoth State Department and CIA officials, as well as Embassy officials, are not happy about this development, considering it a loss to the Peruvian government as well as a loss in terms of projecting US influence in the country."
 CIA_PERU.7.d:0 "An official from the US Embassy in Lima has come to us via the Minister for Agriculture with an urgent proposal on rural agrarian reforms that our government can implement in the indigenous-majority Andean departments. According to the agricultural officer, these proposals include the formation of local indigenous land cooperatives, further decentralization measures by the central government in Lima, and the beginning of subsidies and other aid for farms and cooperatives.\n\nThese proposals have generated much controversy within our government, with most conservative politicians and military officers decrying the proposals as not appropriate and too left-wing, resembling Sandero Luminoso propaganda put out in those areas. However, many liberal-leaning officers and politicians argue that these reforms, while limited, may bring support to our cause, especially among indigenous populations who feel that they have been neglected or discriminated against when it comes to land policies; and because of that, are turning to the SL to achieve their goals. How shall we choose?"
 CIA_PERU.8.d:0 "An agricultural officer attached to the US Embassy in Lima has reported that the Peruvian Government, via the Minister of Agriculture, has accepted a US proposal for rural reform in the Andean Highlands. Originally proposed as a way to attract more government support among native populations, who feel marginalized and make up the bulk of Shining Path (Sandero Luminoso) support, the reform includes the formation of indigenous land cooperatives, decentralization initiatives, and subsidies to farmers.\n\nWidely expected to fail in Peru’s heavily conservative and anti-communist government, the reform package is expected to be approved soon, according to the Peruvian Minister of Agriculture. State Department and CIA officials are pleased by this development, and the President expects to be briefed on it soon."
 CIA_PERU.9.d:0 "Unfortunately, the US Embassy in Lima reports that the Peruvian Government has unequivocally rejected all proposals for rural reform in the Andean Highlands region of the country. Proposed as a strategy to attract crucial indigenous support in the ongoing counterinsurgency campaign against Shining Path, the Peruvian Minister of Agriculture decried it in a statement as “playing into the hands of Guzman and his Maoist terrorists” and “weakening the power of the Republic at a crucial moment when security is paramount.”\n\nState Department and CIA officials are reportedly frustrated by this development, as it appears that US inroads to Peru are slimming. The President was supposed to be briefed on these developments, but senior officials have decided to hold back on telling him for now."
 CIA_PERU.10.d:0 "The Defense Attache at the US Embassy in Lima has come to us via the Minister of Defense with an urgent proposal on rules of engagement for Peruvian Armed Forces units and personnel in their ongoing counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoist Sandero Luminoso guerrillas. The Attache has suggested several examples of more comprehensive rules of engagement, including enforcement of civil action operations, incident reports, and a more rigid command structure as well as independent military inspector-generals in each unit.\n\nSenior generals within the Armed Forces have sharply opposed this proposal as running counter to what has been a relatively successful campaign thus far, with government troops operating with near-total impunity. They argue that rigid rules of engagement would play into the hands of the Communists, ensure the loss of operational integrity, and remove any surprise tactics from government forces. Proponents, however, argue that such rules will temper the scale of future atrocities and further legitimize the military as a state enforcement power. How shall we choose?"
 CIA_PERU.11.d:0 "The Defense Attache to the US Embassy in Lima has reported that the Peruvian Government has reluctantly accepted a proposed set of rules of engagement for the Armed Forces in their ongoing counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoist Sandero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla group. Proposed as a way to set guardrails against government forces and to prevent further atrocities committed by the military, the rules of engagement include more stringent chains of command, an independent inspector-general, and more punitive measures for accused soldiers.\n\nState Department and CIA officers are pleased with this development, but remain somewhat concerned that the Peruvian Armed Forces may not follow through on their promises. Additional enforcement will be required to make sure that Peru follows their end of the bargain."
 CIA_PERU.12.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Defense Attache at the US Embassy in Lima has reported that the Peruvian Government and Armed Forces have fully rejected our proposals for more comprehensive rules of engagement in their ongoing counterinsurgency campaign against the Sandero Luminoso Communist guerrilla group. A spokesman for the Peruvian Ministry of Defense condemned the proposal as an “attempt to control the internal affairs of Peru” and that “so-called atrocities are attempts by the Communist terrorists to shift the blame from their own crimes.”\n\nState Department and CIA officials are not pleased with this development, but not altogether surprised.

Director, go.”\n\nThe Director for Central Intelligence, [GetCurrentCIADir], stood up. “Mr. President, approximately two hours ago, we received word from still-embedded agents in Peru that the capital city of Lima has officially fallen to communist insurgents, led by the Sandero Luminoso, or Shining Path, Maoist guerrilla group.”\n\nSecretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] broke in. “As you know, Mr. President, the embassy in Lima was evacuated several days ago and personnel were airlifted to Brazil. Officially, there are no United States government personnel still on the ground there. We are unsure about the number of US citizens or any embedded intelligence personnel still in-country, but are doing our best to interface with neighboring Ecuador and Chile to determine their whereabouts.

State will have ambassadors going to both and we will be aggressively lobbying for whatever solution comes out of this room tonight.”\n\nNational Security Advisor [GetCurrentNatSecAdv] then stood up. “Mr. President, most of the officials here tonight have agreed on at least two possible courses of action. We cannot let this action by Shining Path go unanswered, especially with our ongoing involvement in South America and in particular, assistance to the now-ousted Peruvian government. Therefore we have two options: go the diplomatic route and condemn and sanction, using the powers of the UN and OAS as well as other regional bodies; or to take the more interventionist path, which would involve both American and likely regional militaries forming a coalition and retaking populated areas.”\n\nSeveral military officers, including the Commander of US Southern Command spoke up. “Mr. President, US Southern Command has been monitoring the situation as it’s been developing and has pulled all US personnel and most senior Peruvian military officials out of the country. We are preparing possible operational plans including multinational operations, but it is not known how effective an intervention will be, particularly against a tough and experienced guerrilla force.”\n\n“Very well.” The President sighed, looking around. “Secretary, get me possible sanctions and diplomatic solutions. I want any and all military options and before we do anything we need diplomatic assurances. Make some calls and we’ll reconvene in a few hours.”"

 CIA_CHIAPAS.0.d:0 "ZAPATISTA INSURGENCY IN CHIAPAS: SUMMARY\nMexico Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nRecently, the southernmost Mexican state of Chiapas has been rocked by a new insurgency movement, calling themselves the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejercito Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, or EZLN). Composed mainly of indigenous people and local subsistence farmers, the EZLN has resisted oppression by the Chiapas state government and federal government in Mexico City via a series of attacks and kidnappings of prominent and former state officials.\n\nEspousing an ideology known as “neozapatismo,” the EZLN, or Zapatistas, take their name from Emiliano Zapata, a leader of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, and consists of mainly left-wing, Mayan traditional indigenous culture, Catholic liberation theology, and Marxism. The Zapatistas are strong advocates for communal land rights, particularly with the indigenous Mexican population, and oppose economic globalization on the grounds that it is oppressive to local peoples and negatively affects the lives of the peasant class.\n\nIn recent weeks, the EZLN has begun an uprising in the state of Chiapas, where they primarily operate; attacking civic centers and government buildings in the cities of San Cristobal de las Casas, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo, and Chanal. They have been met by government forces in most instances, wreaking havoc before returning to the Lacandon Jungle, where the group mostly operates.\n\nIt is unclear how we should respond to this. On one hand, it is an internal issue for Mexico; however, the impulse to support the Zapatistas is large, and would go against established policy."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.1.d:0 "AUTONOMY IN CHIAPAS: POSSIBILITIES FOR FUTURE\nMexico Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe recent indigenous opposition and insurgency in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas has galvanized calls for greater state autonomy. The inability of Mexican federal forces to adequately control the situation, and predicated on mistreatment from Mexico City, has caused CIA and State Department officials in the region to take significant notice. Pushes for autonomy by Chiapas state officials and EZLN members have taken notice, and potential autonomous status of Chiapas may have the following goals and effects:\n\n1. EZLN forces already have adequate control of the Chiapas state government, and any further attempts by the federal Mexican Government may result in a wider conflict in the country, as anti-government and indigenous groups are widespread throughout, particularly after the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\n2. Mexican officials have pushed us for further military aid. However, we support a peaceful solution in this case, as a wider conflict will affect our economic relations and Mexico’s economy.\n\n3. The Intelligence Community is not supportive of covert aid to either party. Coordinating negotiations on a separate state for Chiapas, or greater autonomy within the federal Mexican Government, will provide greater legitimacy for the United States, EZLN, and other interested parties."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.2.d:0 "The US Ambassador in Mexico City has approached our government with a proposal for autonomy in the southern state of Chiapas. While our counterinsurgency campaign against the separatist and left-wing Zapatistas (EZLN) forces has been marginally successful, the autonomy proposal has garnered approval, both in the international community and in the Chiapas state and federal governments. Such proposals include devolving more economic and budgetary authority to the Chiapas government, restricting federal military and security forces from conducting operations in the state, and providing greater ethnic language and land ownership rights to the indigenous people of Chiapas, most of whom make up the EZLN movement.\n\nProgressive members of our government argue the possible benefits of granting Chiapas autonomy, in that their rebellion may quiet down and that the EZLN may be able to be negotiated with in good faith based on legitimate concerns and demands, while also remaining under the general control of the federal government and not becoming a separate sovereign state. More conservative members of our government have continually argued the drawbacks in granting Chiapas autonomy, saying that they would play right into the hands of the EZLN and that other Mexican states would also consider demanding autonomy from the federal government, further decentralizing the control that Mexico City has on the states. How should we choose in this proposal?"
 CIA_CHIAPAS.3.d:0 "The US Embassy in Mexico City has reported that the federal Mexican Government has approved a draft proposal to grant autonomy and further reforms in the southernmost state of Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala. Facing an indigenous and left-wing separatist and reform movement known as the Zapatistas or the EZLN, the Mexican Secretary of the Interior said in his statement that “due to extenuating circumstances, the state of Chiapas will be provided with further resources to support its economic activities and self-governance,” including a restriction on federal military activities in the state, deregulation of taxation and finance policies towards the state, and an expansion of powers for the Governor of Chiapas.\n\nWhile not overtly involved in the Zapatista issue, Mexican and Latin American-focused policymakers in Washington are pleased by this development, allowing greater self-governance and less involvement of federal officials on the local indigenous populace, who have faced both political and economic repression in the past."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.4.d:0 "The US Embassy in Mexico City has reported that the federal Mexican Government has rejected a draft proposal to grant autonomy and further reforms in the southernmost state of Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala. Facing an indigenous and left-wing separatist and reform movement known as the Zapatistas or the EZLN, the Mexican Secretary of the Interior reiterated in a statement that “legitimate concerns can be addressed through other means” and that “terrorism by EZLN forces on innocent civilians in Chiapas cannot be rewarded by giving them more power and influence.” The Secretary then announced a further crackdown and enforcement mission against the EZLN by Mexican military and police forces, ensuring that autonomy would not come to the state via Mexico City.\n\nWhile not overtly involved in the Zapatista issue, Mexican and Latin American-focused policymakers are disheartened by this development, with some fearing the outbreak of a wider conflict due to EZLN anger at this announcement."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.5.d:0 "BENEFITS OF SUPPORT TO ZAPATISTA REBELS/EZLN FORCES\nMexico Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; US EMBASSY MEXICO CITY\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nBecoming aware that the conflict between the Zapatistas in the state of Chiapas and the federal Mexican Government has worsened, the CIA Chief of Station in Mexico City attaches the following recommendations for greater US involvement in and support of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN, or Zapatistas) in an attempt to guarantee self-governance and indigenous rights in the region.\n\n1. Mexican forces, consisting of both military and local police forces, have attempted to conduct counterinsurgency operations against EZLN forces, but have not been successful due to EZLN positions and headquarters located in the Lacandon Jungle, which crosses the Mexican-Guatemalan border and is extremely hard to navigate without being a local. US forces are adept at jungle warfare and insurgency tactics, and military support against a militarily incompetent force would prove generally successful.\n\n2. Support for the EZLN has waned outside of Chiapas. US support could include propaganda and civic action programs in other Mexican provinces of the Zapatista ideology, with the idea of stirring up further resentment and allowing action against the Mexican Government to be taken in further numbers.\n\n3. Covert support initiatives could include arms transfers of small arms, machine guns, small vehicles, explosives, some electronic and communications equipment, limited air support, and other support equipment. Training could also be provided by USSOUTHCOM forces or CIA assets, particularly focusing on attacks towards weak points and expanding the insurgency network.\n\nThe above is stated with the assumption that CIA and the White House will want to actually support the EZLN. CIA Chief of Station [REDACTED]’s opinion does not represent the opinions of all officials at CIA."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.6.d:0 "MODERATING THE ZAPATISTA MOVEMENT AWAY FROM MARXISM\nMexico Desk, Office of Latin American Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence; US EMBASSY MEXICO CITY\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe Zapatista movement, also known as the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN), primarily located in the southernmost Mexican state of Chiapas, has become known for its left-wing, indigenous, pro-land reform positions, taking their ideology and advice from late Mexican revolutionary Emilio Zapata. While the United States has committed to supporting the EZLN in their campaign against the federal Mexican government, the CIA Chief of Station in Mexico City has expressed concern about the movement’s pro-Marxist leanings and has attached the following suggestions for political moderation of Zapatista cells.\n\n1. Reiterate the importance of land reform and indigenous rights without explicitly Marxist ideas. Land reform can and has been accomplished by other political regimes that are not explicitly Marxist, and Marxist ideology is not necessarily required to accomplish their goals.\n\n2. Negotiation with the Mexican federal government and Chiapas state government is still an avenue to accomplishing EZLN goals. The movement should be sufficiently moderated if top EZLN officials are convinced of peaceful options and not just limited to offensive attacks.\n\n3. Offensive attacks, while limited in scope, should have specific political goals and be restricted to avoid civilian casualties at all possible. Such restrictions and rules of engagements should adequately prevent more radical figures within the EZLN from committing unnecessary attacks that will cause further intervention by Mexican federal forces.\n\nIt is hoped that these recommendations by CIA Chief of Station [REDACTED], whose opinions do not necessarily represent all of those in the CIA, will allow policymakers to sufficiently moderate the movement, taking them away from a Marxist orientation and allowing further American support."
 CIA_CHIAPAS.7.d:0 "It was a cool night over northern Guatemala as the C-130 flew low over the jungle. The pilot, a US Air Force lieutenant, yawned as he banked slightly left, checking his map and compass for the Mexican border, which was basically invisible from this altitude.\n\nBehind him sat six men, dressed in combat fatigues virtually indistinguishable from Mexican police, armed with holstered pistols and M-16s as they sat hooked into the aircraft, rucksacks in between their legs. They checked their lights, magazines, strapping more bags to themselves as the ramp lowered, the pilot seeing a flash from the ground indicating the drop point.\n\nA red light flashed, and a buzzer rang as the men saluted the loadmaster in the cargo area, dropping out of the aircraft one by one opening parachutes and descending into the Lacandon Jungle below them. The C-130 kept on, as it was undercover on “electronics and surveillance operations” over Mexico from Palmerola Air Force Base in Honduras. The men, however, would land in the jungle, being met by EZLN guerrillas, and inserted into the command structure to begin training for the indigenous, anti-government movement focused on land reform in the southern state of Chiapas. All in a day’s work for these men of Langley."

 CIA_CAM80.0.d:0 "THE SITUATION IN CAMBODIA: POSSIBILITIES FOR US INVOLVEMENT\nCambodia Desk, Office of Southeast Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nSince the end of US involvement in the Vietnam conflict, the geopolitical and internal situation in neighboring Cambodia has become complicated. Having removed Norodom Sihanouk from power in a 1970 coup, the US-backed regime faced insurgency from the Communist Khmer Rouge, who eventually seized control of Phnom Penh, the capital, in 1975.\n\nRuling under a reign of terror for three years, the Khmer Rouge regime killed up to two million Cambodians, before being ousted in 1978 by a Vietnamese invasion from the east. The country is currently ruled by the Vietnamese-backed, pro-Soviet, and anti-Khmer Rouge Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party as the People’s Republic of Kampuchea.\n\nIntelligence has indicated that a government-in-exile may be formed. Known as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, it is backed by the People’s Republic of China under [PRC.GetLeader] and is composed of the remnants of the Khmer Rouge regime, the anti-Khmer Rouge Khmer People’s National Liberation Front (KPNLF), and the Sihanouk-led royalist National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC).\n\nThe US has a unique opportunity to change policy in this region. Having recovered from our actions in Vietnam, Washington could consider helping to organize this Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, granting it key international recognition that would allow it to usurp the Hanoi-backed regime in Phnom Penh. However, bearing in mind the participation of the Khmer Rouge in the Coalition Government, it may be wise to hold for the moment. Allowing KR to have influence may lead to further problems in the future."
 CIA_CAM80.1.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, US Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] announced today that the US would not be supporting a proposed Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, an opposition group against the ruling People’s Republic of Kampuchea, a Vietnamese-backed rump state. Composed of Khmer Rouge elements, the anti-KR Khmer People’s National Liberation Front, and the royalist FUNCINPEC party, the Coalition Government has received support from Communist China as a hedge against Vietnam.\n\nReiterating that “the United States does not support any coalition government that includes Khmer Rouge elements,” the Secretary of State essentially ended any chance of an opposition Coalition Government in exile from getting international recognition."
 CIA_CAM80.2.d:0 "PROPOSAL FOR INTELLIGENCE SHARING TO ASEAN TOWARDS CAMBODIA\nCambodia Desk, Office of Southeast Asian Analysis, Directorate of Intelligence\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nFormed in 1967 between Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)’s main goal is to accelerate regional collaboration, contain communism, and ensure stable economic and cultural growth. In recent years, with the spread of communism in the region and the Vietnam conflict, ASEAN has become more important to US security interests, particularly relating to Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia.\n\nBased on the US Intelligence Community, the Department of State, and the White House’s decision to not support the proposed Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea; Cambodia Desk, along with Embassy Bangkok, recommends closer American cooperation ASEAN as a means of indirect involvement in Cambodian and regional affairs, focusing on defense, security cooperation, and intelligence sharing with all member nations.\n\n1. Intelligence sharing with member nation services, including the Thai National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Indonesian State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (BAKIN), the Malaysian External Intelligence Organization (MEIO), and the Filipino National Intelligence and Security Authority (NISA). This intelligence sharing, particularly with NIA and NISA, will ensure timely intelligence and support of regional allies in surveilling Cambodian activities.\n\n2. Other forms of security cooperation may also be considered, including Department of Defense Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and training initiatives. Assets from CIA and DIA may also consider conducting on-the-ground training, particularly in surveillance and insurgency tactics on the Thai-Cambodian border.\n\n3. A key facet should be ensuring an adequate intelligence reporting and verification network to keep tabs on Phnom Penh, particularly as the current regime is pro-Hanoi and essentially a rump state."
 CIA_CAM80.3.d:0 "The CIA Chief of Station in Bangkok has informed us that the United States will begin sharing classified intelligence information on the Cambodian government to our National Intelligence Agency (NIA). Mostly consisting of contact reports, news broadcast transcripts, and classified National Intelligence Estimates on Cambodia, the CIA has begun sending reams and reams of paper documents across Bangkok to NIA offices, with promises of further intelligence training and cooperation in surveillance efforts towards Cambodia.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to expand intelligence sharing in Southeast Asia among members of ASEAN, Thailand represents the focal point in American efforts to keep tabs on the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian rump state. Prominent Thai military and intelligence officials are pleased by this development and excited to collaborate more with American intelligence assets, like they similarly did during the Vietnam conflict."

The United States refuses to recognize nor support the current Vietnamese-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea, despite their anti-Khmer Rouge leanings.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea may appear to be a better option, but is similarly plagued with internal issues. For one, the coalition is composed of former Khmer Rouge remnants, which if discovered will cause international issues for the United States; as well as royalist elements under Norodom Sihanouk that were ousted by the Khmer Rouge, and anti-Khmer Rouge elements. It is clear that we should lend our support to neither party, and thus remain neutral in the region.\n\nMaintaining support to ASEAN and other Free World allies in the region, however, is imperative. Action must be taken against Hanoi and its puppet in Phnom Penh, but not one that supports the Coalition Government in its current form."

It is the opinion of Cambodia Desk, Embassy Bangkok, and Embassy Beijing that support should be given to all three factions in the government, but with caution, due to their sometimes opposite stances to American interests and relationships with each other.\n\nKhmer Rouge remnants, officially known as the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, represents the most dominant group in the coalition government. Having been ousted by the Vietnamese invasion and subsequent formation of the Hanoi-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge were sidelined, having been forced to compromise with other anti-Vietnamese parties to achieve their goals. This faction has been the primary point of concern among Cambodia Desk, Embassy Beijing, and officials at Langley due to their influence and desire to militarily overthrow the PRK.\n\nThe Khmer People’s National Liberation Front (KPNLF), formed in 1979 as a coalition of anti-Vietnamese and anti-PRK guerrilla movements, is primarily anti-communist in nature. Unlike the Khmer Rouge, the KPNLF is militarized in nature, lacking the political aspects that are desperately needed in a new government, which explains their lack of influence compared to the Khmer Rouge. However, supporting them the most is paramount to American security interests as they are most closely aligned to Washington.\n\nFinally, the royalist party FUNCINPEC is the last major member of the Coalition, having been formed by former Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk in 1981; it is heavily influential and involved with the Chinese government, having a shared goal of ousting the PRK from Cambodia; even considering allying with the Khmer Rouge to affect their goals. While not overly influential, the Coalition Government is led by Sihanouk, picked as a compromise candidate.\n\n Supporting all three parties overtly is key to maintaining overall US support and internal unity of the CGDK; the KPNLF is the most US-aligned faction and we should consider more aid and support to those forces without being exclusionary."

Composed of older-model main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, minesweepers, as well as several UH-1 Huey helicopters, the aid package is designed to give our forces the initiative in combating PRK and Vietnamese forces on the Thai-Cambodian border.\n\nFigures within our government are widely pleased by this development; in addition to aid from China, this assistance will please the KPNLF and FUNCINPEC forces, many of whom form the front-line combat troops within the Coalition Government."
 CIA_CAM80.15.d:0 "The US envoy leading our American representation in Beijing has informed us that the United States will only be limiting proposed aid packages to humanitarian aid. Despite our government’s pleas for weapons and training opportunities to enhance our capability to combat the PRK and Vietnamese forces, Washington has decided our priorities for us.\n\nAccording to the envoy, the aid will be limited to “humanitarian supplies,” including food rations, water supplies, clothes, medical supplies, building equipment, and other items used to increase the quality of life of CGDK members and the territory we hold. Unfortunately, we hold little territory and would have preferred weapons aid first.\n\nMembers of our government, particularly the KPNLF, are furious by this development, wanting additional weapons aid as that is the Government’s priority."
 CIA_CAM80.16.d:0 "In Washington today, US Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState] announced that the United States would be pursuing support for regime change in Cambodia. Currently dominated by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, the Cambodian government is effectively controlled by their Vietnamese invaders, who hold a pro-Soviet line.\n\nWidely expected to announce this as a means of legitimizing regime change in favor of the US-backed Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, this announcement was strongly condemned by the Cambodian government, the Vietnamese government, the Soviets and the rest of the Eastern Bloc."
 CIA_CAM80.17.d:0 "The US envoy leading our American representation in Beijing has informed us that the United States is actively and publicly pushing for regime change in our favor in Cambodia. In a public announcement from Washington, Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], announced public support for our government and urged international allies to support our cause.\n\nAll parties in the Coalition Government are pleased by this announcement, including Khmer Rouge forces. Particularly since heavy equipment has been delivered, this will guarantee our capabilities and our victory against the Hanoi-backed regime!"

 # CIA Afghan Civil War
 AFG_CW.0.desc:0 "Following the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and full scale civil war has broken out. While the vast majority of opposition factions have banded under the flag of the Afghan Interim Government, the unity of the coalition is extremely suspect to say the least. With the central government unlikely to be able to indefinitely hold off the more or less unified opposition forces, the chances of the opposition being able to form a stable government is estimated at nearly non-existent. To complicate matters further, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, the faction led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has withdrawn from the Afghan Interim Government and has taken out their own territory near Pakistan. Given the bulk of aid from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan flow to Hekmatayar’s forces one must wonder whether this alone has already doomed the slim chances of a peaceful resolution among the rebel factions. Our administration must now determine how to proceed, if we proceed at all in this burgeoning conflict."
 AFG_CW.1.desc:0 "After intensive debates within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Council (NSC) has decided to authorize additional funding for Afghani resistance forces in the beleaguered Central Asian nation. However, a decision on whom to support is still being largely debated within the intelligence apparatus. Up to this point most of our allies in the endeavor of  backing resistance forces in the region have been supplying Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin. However his forces have yet to actually score a key military victory and have recently come at odds with the general forces. The other major faction we could support would be Jamat-e Isliami, led by noted resistance fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud. In addition to both being anti-communist, it should be noted that given the ethnic diversity of Afghanistan that Massoud and his forces largely represent Tajik interests while Hekmatyar largely represent Pashtun interests. Either choice may have long reaching consequences. "
 AFG_CW.2.desc:0 "After further debate, the National Security Council has decided to back Jamat-e Isliami over Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin. Most of our key regional allies, especially Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have directed most of their funding and support to Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and other affiliated groups. However, said group has lacked any notable military victories since their inception throughout either the Soviet-Afghan War or so far during the civil war. Additionally, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin has been shown to be politically unreliable, a key example of this was his recent withdrawal from the coalition forces against the central government. Additionally concerns have been raised over Hekmatyar’s temperament and ideology, especially with his representation of Pashtun interests, connections with more radical elements and stockpiling of heavier weaponry while staying out of the ongoing civil war. Contrarily, Massoud appears to be a unifying figure and notable leader over the last decade and could provide the leader that Afghanistan will need once the war ends. "
 AFG_CW.3.desc:0 "Thankfully, the United States has decided to support us with weaponry and financial aid in the imminent future. This comes after several meetings with American intelligence officers in northern Afghanistan in light of divisions in the opposition coalition against the communist central government along with ensuring we are capable of putting an end to the central government. Unfortunately once we inevitably defeat the Kabul government, we will need to deal with the various warlords and other factions in the ongoing war. Most concerningly is that Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin which has split off from our coalition and has pulled back to their Pashtun strongholds near Pakistan. In a worst case scenario, Hekmatyar may be waiting for us to seize Kabul before launching his own offensive to seize our prize."
 AFG_CW.4.desc:0 "While perhaps not the most storied faction during the Afghan-Soviet War, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and their leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, has been a steadfast ally to our regional security partners along with being potentially useful in a reunified Afghanistan as a representative of the Pashtun people. However, Hekmatyar has led his organization to withdraw from the ongoing fighting between the interim government and communist central government and has withdrawn to his Pashtun populated redoubts. While unfortunate, this does provide a unique opportunity to await both sides to bleed each other out and then provide Hekmatyar  sufficient aid to seize control of Kabul at an appropriate time. That said, several intelligence analysts have dissented with this decision arguing that Hekmatyar is nothing more than an opportunist who will flip on his handlers the second it becomes beneficial to him."
 AFG_CW.5.desc:0 "Excellent news, Washington has decided to double down on their support for our case and have decided to ramp up their support for our cause at the expense of other Afghani factions. Even more promising is American support for our intentions to seize Kabul once the other factions bleed themselves dry in the ongoing civil war. With American support and further coordination between Washington, Riyadh and Islamabad, our forces will stand a much higher chance of successfully seizing Kabul and other critical areas in the nation when we decide to strike. On the downside, this move will surely lead to our movement being more dependent on the United States and will likely lead to us having to cave to American interests for the foreseeable future. However, this is a small price to pay for the continued support of a global power."
 AFG_CW.6.desc:0 "Over the last decade, our key regional allies, in particular Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have backed Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin militant faction. However as time has passed, it has become clear that Hekmatayar has placed little effort in actually fighting his proclaimed enemies and even now has abandoned the coalition against the central Kabul government to withdraw to his Pashtun redoubts. Doing so may slightly alienate some of our allies, in particular Pakistan, however we should not be the determining factor in our Afghanistan policy. Further analysis by the Central Intelligence Agency has reaffirmed the National Security Council’s belief that Hekmatyar is above all an opportunist and will likely seek to cause chaos and discord later into the ongoing conflict. Contrarily, some analysts have also argued that by withdrawing support from Hekmatyar, a major figure in the Pashtun community, may lead to further radicalization among the Pashtun population of Afghanistan."
 AFG_CW.7.desc:0 "Unfortunately, the Americans have decided to halt support for our cause. While our other foreign suppliers have reassured us that they have not abandoned us, their claims are suspect at best. However, we have stockpiled significant weaponry to launch an attack on Kabul once the forces of the Afghan Interim Government and the communist central government have bled each other out. Sadly, others do not realize that we must stake our own course and seize power on our own to prevent the further oppression of the Pashtun people. The Hazara and Tajik presence in the interim coalition would surely band together to rule the country at the expense of our people, for now we must lie in wait and prepare for our eventual attack on Kabul.\n\nPerhaps we should look into deepening ties with local clerics to rally support in friendly territory?"
 
 # CIA Pakistan Nukes
 CIA_PAKn.0.desc:0 "The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has recently learned of significant advances in the Pakistani nuclear program. Given the general instability in Pakistan and longstanding conflict with India, this is a cause of major concern. On the other hand, Pakistan is a major supporter of our activities in Afghanistan, actively anti-communist and one of our key allies in the region. This leaves us with two real options, the first option, the easiest by far would be to effectively ignore the existence of the program and in the case of a public reveal seek to block sanctions on Pakistan in the United Nations Security Council. This would enable Pakistan to continue the program and further damage nuclear non-proliferation but would suit our interests in the region. The second option would be to sanction Pakistan and seek to force the end of the program by confirming its existence publicly and backing sanction efforts in the United Nations. However this would almost assuredly cost us our alliance with Pakistan and endanger our operations in the region. How should we proceed?"
 CIA_PAKn.1.desc:0 "American President [USA.GetLeader] confirmed that they have instructed the Treasury Department to implement sanctions on Pakistan in regard to the nation’s active nuclear weapons program. The sanctions are aimed at the nuclear program itself as well as the political and military leadership in Pakistan. While the Pakistan nuclear program was not confirmed with certainty prior, this does not come as much of a surprise to the international community. What is surprising however, is that the United States has decided to take action on the matter. In recent years, Washington has increased ties with Pakistan out of shared strategic goals and enemies in the region. Especially with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan where both the United States and Pakistan are both backing anti-communist forces against the central government. This measure throws into doubt the future of American-Pakistani ties and cooperation in the region."
 CIA_PAKn.2.desc:0 "News from Washington. America has imposed a wide range of sanctions against our government, military and in particular our nuclear program. Given our reliance on American military and economic support for our foreign endeavors and in stabilizing our rule, this is catastrophic. Not only is America placing sanctions on us, but signals have been made that the United States will push for sanctions against us in the United Nations Security Council. This set of actions will surely further destabilize our rule and endanger continued support to the mujahideen in Afghanistan. However, we have little choice but to continue our nuclear program given that India has nuclear weaponry. We will never be secure as long as India has nuclear weapons while we have no counter to prevent further Indian aggression on our rightful "
 CIA_PAKn.3.desc:0 "While the unveiling of our nuclear program has been a major blow to our nation and led to sanctions from multiple countries, the United States has remained steadfast in supporting our government. The American ambassador noted that while Washington does not approve of our nuclear program, that it was just a minor blight on our continued relationship and is vastly overshadowed by the need for continued cooperation in the fight against communism in the region. Emphasis was especially placed on the continued coordination in Afghanistan in aiming to topple the communist Afghan government and prevent the further expansion of communism in the region. While this will certainly prevent many nations from implementing sanctions, our economy will still take a hit from this ordeal, however the worst case scenario has been averted."

 # CIA Mozambique
 MZB_CIA80.0:0 "The Portuguese departure from Africa following the Carnation Revolution has led to civil wars in both Angola and Mozambique. While Mozambique did not instantly fall into civil war like Angola, tensions between different factions, parties and ethnic conflicts are all contributing factors. The war, between the communist Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and the nationalist Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO). During the independence war in Mozambique, FRELIMO was effectively the sole faction fighting Portuguese rule. RENAMO, was established the year following Portuguese departure by former members of FRELIMO’s armed wing, anti-communist politicians and former Portuguese Flechas. The Flechas were the elite paramilitary units of the Portuguese Secret Police during the independence war and were composed of local tribesmen and rebel defectors.\n\nHowever lesser known to the general public, Rhodesia played a large role in shaping and establishing RENAMO as a means to destabilize Mozambique. Following the end of Rhodesia, former members of Rhodesia’s military joined RENAMO. The civil war provides us with an interesting opportunity. We could stick to supplying humanitarian aid or seek to broker a diplomatic resolution. However this would provide us with little geopolitical benefits. A more ambitious strategy would be to collaborate with South Africa in backing RENAMO and seek to justify greater intervention into the conflict."
 MZB_CIA80.1:0 "The civil war and aftermath of the independence war against Portugal has left Mozambique destitute and at risk for famine, the heavy usage of landmines has also led to a medical crisis with a large number of amputees. To help alleviate this, the President has authorized a plan of action to provide humanitarian aid to Mozambique through third parties and dealing with representatives from both sides of the armed conflict to allow for the aid to be sent into their respective controlled territories.Hopefully such negotiations could lead to further contacts and bridges being built to enable diplomacy to prevail and bring an amicable end to the civil war. Unlike Angola or Ethiopia, the Mozambican Civil War has seen fairly little external interventions in recent years, while South Africa, and formerly Rhodesia had involved themselves in the conflict, their has been no major Soviet, Cuban or other Eastern Bloc presence in Mozambique."
 MZB_CIA80.2:0 "Our contacts with the Central Intelligence Agency have recently conveyed to us that we will be expected to attend negotiations with the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) government if FRELIMO agrees to proposed negotiations hosted by Washington to bring an end to the civil war. The terms Washington has informed us that they plan to present would to some extent represent a laying down of arms on our side and accepting positions within a unity government in advance of free elections. Senior party membership privy to the proposal have expressed grave concerns over the potential of FRELIMO to void the terms of the deal after they have been disarmed while others have expressed a willingness to negotiate to bring an end to an increasingly devastating civil war. Another even more pressing concern has been raised, that being if we choose to decline will Washington simply force our hand by threatening to suspend aid and pressure Malawi and South Africa to halt material aid?"
 MZB_CIA80.3:0 "Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) has unsurprisingly relayed their acceptance of our negotiation proposal and have announced internally their support for the measure. While we had little doubt that RENAMO would eventually come to the table, the decision to immediately agree to terms is a welcome sight for our administration. Concerns had been raised that the more hardliner members of RENAMO, especially those who had previously fought for Rhodesia and Portugal would seek to undermine potential negotiations. However, internal opposition has failed to materialize, and most RENAMO members expressed a desire to end the civil war if fair terms can be reached and enforced by a third party to ensure the terms are upheld. Now we await to hear back from the Mozambican government's response to our negotiation proposal."
 MZB_CIA80.4:0 "Surprisingly the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) has informed us they have no desire to engage in negotiations with the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO). Our analysts find it hilarious that they think they have a choice in this matter. Our agents operating as handlers in RENAMO have already gotten to work pressuring senior members to reconsider, and several more hostile members have been liquidated. We expect RENAMO will change their mind in the coming days after we further express our displeasure by threatening to halt aid and inform them we are considering pressuring Pretoria to halt their own aid shipments to RENAMO bases in Mozambique and Malawi. While RENAMO continues to be pressed, we should continue our discussions with FRELIMO to try to get negotiations on track."
 MZB_CIA80.5:0 "An interesting proposal has arrived recently. American diplomats have approached our foreign office and have proposed to hold negotiations between ourselves and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) with the goal of bringing about an end to the civil war. On one hand, accepting this move, whether it succeeds or fails, would reflect positively on our government and would demonstrate our willingness to bring a peaceful end to the civil war. However, such a move would surely lead to a legitimization of RENAMO and if the negotiations succeed will inevitably lead to a weakening of our control over the state apparatus and likely concessions would include moderating our foreign policy along with guaranteeing free elections in the near future, elections we may very well lose. Furthermore, accepting the offer would likely alienate our foreign allies and weaken socialist nations' support for our government. How should we proceed?"
 MZB_CIA80.6:0 "Surprisingly, the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO).has agreed to participate in the negotiations that we had requested. While unexpected, this is great news and could be an opportunity to bring an end to the bloody civil war in Mozambique and exert concessions from FRELIMO in forming a new unity government that may distance itself from Moscow and seek a more conciliatory course of action in regard to Pretoria. The State Department has been authorized to force significant concessions out of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) to ensure a productive round of negotiations and ending the civil war in favorable terms to the west. The planned proposal would establish a unified government, with the head being from FRELIMO with RENAMO getting various positions within the government and a guarantee of free elections within a few years to be honored by both sides. This should be acceptable to both sides and seek to moderate the Mozambican government. "
 MZB_CIA80.7:0 "Unfortunately, the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO). Has rejected our proposed negotiations and decried them as a stalling tactic for us to arm the anti-communist Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO). Truly, this is a missed opportunity on their side, we were open to bringing a peaceful end on fair terms for both sides and planned to push for peaceful elections in the near-future. RENAMO has reacted largely positively to the development given their initial resilience in accepting negotiations in the first place. Our administration can now either concede our efforts to end the civil war, or consider more extreme proposals circulating within the Central Intelligence Agency and supported by more militant members of the National Security Council. Regardless, if nothing else is assured, the future of Mozambique as the civil war continues to escalate once more is bleak at best."
 MZB_CIA80.9:0 "Negotiations have progressed, while we did not get as many concessions as we desired, we have signed on to an agreement with the government to bring an end to the civil war and form a national unity government. The agreement will provide our leadership with several important ministries in the government, legalize our political parties and lead to a new constitution that must be ratified by both parties and an agreement to hold free elections in the coming year with international observers present throughout the nation. Still this brings an end to our armed struggle, at least for now, but this does provide an opportunity for us to engage in free elections and put Mozambique on a path for a better future for all. How the future negotiations over the new constitution and how the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) will honor their agreements is unclear, our contacts with Washington are hopeful about the situation."
 MZB_CIA80.10:0 "Negotiations have concluded and been finalized. To the surprise of many, our negotiators were able to come to an acceptable agreement for both parties, and bring an end to the civil war has been formally signed by the leadership of both our government and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO). While issues remained, we ultimately had more to gain then lose by signing the agreement we have conceded several ministries to RENAMO and will have to conduct free elections in the coming years, our party has kept control of the presidency and will be able to take a key position in drafting the new constitution. The concessions to RENAMO by all means do decrease our influence in government, but will not cripple our ability to win the ensuing elections. Leadership remains confident that the bulk of public support remains loyal to FRELIMO given our role liberating the nation from Portugal. Still, we must remain cautious of RENAMO, Pretoria and Lilongwe intentions toward influencing the election as well as ensure the demilitarization of RENAMO forces throughout the nation or seek further compromises on integrating their soldiers into the army."
 MZB_CIA80.11:0 "Rolling back communism in southern Africa has become a maj9r strategic goal of the administration. With this policy decision made, a prime target for rollback is Mozambique. The conflict is similar to the Angolan Civil War, but has received significantly less attention and with no Congressional law or amendment barring our administration from investing into the anti-communist rebels in Mozambique, we can begin operations to undermine the Mozambican government without risking criminal penalties. To this extent, the Central Intelligence Agency has directed our agents to expand their connections with the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) to provide limited material aid and training to their forces. Other teams have also been dispatched to organize networks in Cabo Delgado and other northern Islamic areas in Mozambique to work towards building up an Islamic guerilla force to further drain government resources. Concerns have been raised about the potential for this strategy to spiral into sectarian violence, however the President believes that given the Muslim minority in Mozambique is largely present in the north, especially around Cabo Delgado that any religious violence would be limited in scope."
 MZB_CIA80.12:0 "South Africa has long supported the anti-communist rebels in Mozambique. To aid in our endeavors in bolstering the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), the President has authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to begin sharing intelligence about Mozambique with their counterparts in Pretoria with the aim of bolstering South African support for RENAMO. While perhaps distasteful, our agents have also given South Africa detailed information on African National Congress routes and bases inside Mozambique, with this provided, the South African government will surely intensify their war and continue their support for RENAMO. Concerns have been raised however by certain members within the National Security Council over cooperating with the South Africans, but the President has decided that while distasteful, it is a necessary move to further distract the Mozambican government from our involvement in the civil war."
 MZB_CIA80.13:0 "While overthrowing the Mozambican government remains a strategic goal of the administration, the decision has been made that American lives will not be risked in the conflict and that further escalation with the Soviets should be avoided. This will be accomplished by continuing to covertly provide military aid to rebel forces while denying any involvement in the ongoing civil war in Mozambique. Given the general lack of standardized military equipment being utilized, our operatives will be able to quickly supply the rebels with modern firearms, landmines and other less complex systems that should still be able to heavily damage government forces. While perhaps this will not be enough to overthrow the communist government for now, it will make the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) a more credible threat against the government and surely distract them from further involvement with South Africa."
 MZB_CIA80.14:0 "Our efforts so far have begun to bear fruit, however if we wish to truly begin rooting out communism from southern Africa, we must begin laying the groundwork for American intervention in the region. To this effect, our operatives on the ground have collected pictures, testimonials and other information from locals displaying the horrors of the war, while we will of course spin and verify this information, the heartbreaking pictures of children missing limbs due to the heavy usage of landmines will surely tug at the heartstrings of everyday Americans and will help pressure Congress into providing additional funding for our efforts in Africa. While the media spins this, our Ambassador to the United Nations will present the evidence at the United Nations and call for a measure to enforce a ceasefire in Mozambique. This measure will be doomed to failure but will demonstrate to the public our desire to bring an end to the conflict and show how communist forces are refusing to negotiate or do their part in ending the bloodshed."
 MZB_CIA80.15:0 "To further our aim to justify an invasion of Mozambique, the Secretary of State has issued our ultimatum that the government of Mozambique accept to negotiate with the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), By all means, we expect for the Mozambican government to reject our ultimatum which will give us justification to being an armed intervention to overthrow the government and install a pro-western government under RENAMO leadership. While the public is still largely split on the issue, recent public polling has shown an increase in support for taking actions in Mozambique, this comes in the light of our extensive media campaign showing the actions of the Mozambican government against the population of Mozambique. Still, if we are forced to invade Mozambique, we must ensure a quick victory and not remind the public of past quagmires in Asia over the last few decades."
 MZB_CIA80.16:0 "A recent missive from Washington has sent shockwaves throughout the high echelons of our government. The United States is threatening to launch an invasion of our nation to overthrow our government unless we agree to begin negotiations with the rebels to bring about an end to the civil war. Given the tone of the demands, any negotiations we enter into will inherently be rigged against us, however unlike Ethiopia or Angola, there is effectively minimal foreign volunteers aiding in our struggle and the Americans along with their allies would likely be able to cripple our military within days, if that rendering us unable to hold control over the capital and vast swathes of the country. Still, we could accept the proposal and push for a unity government and put our faith in democracy? How should we proceed?"
 MZB_CIA80.18:0 "The Mozambican government has rejected our ultimatum for negotiations, with that announcement we finally have full justification to begin our armed campaign against Mozambique. With that in mind, military planners from the Department of Defense have drafted up plans to send a carrier strike group to the region and have our air assets cripple the Mozambican armed forces swiftly to enable opposition forces to launch a general offensive. Once the government forces are suppressed by our air power, our forces will seek to launch an assault on Maputo, the capital of Mozambique with the covert support of neighboring South Africa. While problems could arise, our analysts do not believe that establishing control over the capital and other urban areas will be a major problem, however, ensuring that a communist insurgency does not cripple the new government will be important and represents a major potential threat to a pro-western government."
 MZB_CIA80.20:0 "Surprisingly, the Mozambican government has seen reason and has agreed to negotiate an ending to the civil war. This was not our intention when we sent the ultimatum, however we can use this as an opportunity to enforce a Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), dominated unity government and seek to ensure a more democratic constitution in Mozambique. A key condition for ending the civil war will be to expel all African National Congress (ANC) forces and members from the nation and merge the armed forces of both sides with a preference being given to RENAMO officers. This is overall a major victory for our administration and represents the first step in reversing the advances of communism in southern Africa. Still, work remains to be done and we must ensure that negotiations go smoothly and avoid overly drawing the ire of Moscow and Congress."
 MZB_CIA80.22:0 "The failure of diplomacy in resolving the Mozambican Civil War has left us with little choice but to intervene directly into the conflict. Despite their potential unwillingness to negotiate, the goal of the operation will be to militarily defeat the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) government and institute a Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) led government. This strategic goal would represent the rolling back of communism in southern Africa as well as reduce the pressure on South Africa by cutting off one of the logistic routes for supplying the African National Congress (ANC) and other insurgent movements within South Africa. That said, we will need to balance our priorities carefully to avoid any public pushback in relation to South Africa. Publically, our motives for the intervention is to bring about a quick end to the bloody civil war and establish a technically democratic, capitalist government that will be open to negotiations with Pretoria."
 MZB_CIA80.24:0 "Great news, the United States has finally launched their intervention into Mozambique to bring an end to the communist rule plaguing our nation. Our contacts in the Central Intelligence Agency have assured us that once the communist government is ousted that we will form the new government. That said, the time is now for us to launch renewed efforts to seize territory and expunge the communists from our rightful land. Safeguarding the rural areas will be critical in the coming times to prevent a renewed communist insurgency throughout the nation. We will also need to begin designing a foreign policy that balances our debts to Pretoria, Washington and Malawi while also building popular support for our government. Malawi in particular will need to be handled carefully given their simultaneous strong support for our movement while also subtly claiming a large chunk of our nation. Our government will also need to determine how to proceed with the handling of African National Congress (ANC) forces and smugglers within the nation. Still this is the start of a historic moment of African history, showing that the communist tide in Africa can be reversed."
 MZB_CIA80.25:0 "Interesting news, the United States has launched a full scale intervention into Mozambique to crush the communist government. While our overt involvement has not been requested, we have provided Washington with significant intelligence on government forces along with their allied militias. Our special forces have been given permission to attack African National Congress (ANC) bases across the border to damage their infrastructure while Mozambique is in chaos. Overall, this is great news for our ongoing issues, given our support for the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), the new government should be friendly to our interests and at the least crackdown on the ANC presence in Mozambique and will likely be open to economic collaboration with us along with our ally Malawi which has also been a major benefactor of RENAMO. While problems persist, especially in Northwest Africa and Angola, this should heavily damage ANC operations in the eastern reaches of our nation and will enable us to redeploy forces to further combat communist forces in the northwest."
 MZB_CIA80.26:0 "The Americans have launched an invasion to overthrow our government. This comes after the failed American attempt to bring an end to the civil war. American troops have begun to land on our shores and a massive bombing attack on our military facilities has begun. Opposition fighters have also been emboldened and seemingly more well-armed and have begun creating chaos behind our lines as well. Unfortunately for us, unlike Angola or Ethiopia, there are effectively minimal Cuban presence and it is incredibly unlikely that reinforcements can come in time to salvage our situation. The current situation is bleak and will likely only become more so as the invasion picks up steam. We will need to take into consideration whether or not attempting a conditional surrender or fighting to the bitter end is the best option moving forward."
 MZB_CIA80.17:0 "In a major escalation, President [USA.GetLeader] has announced an ultimatum towards the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) and the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) to cease hostilities and engage in diplomatic peace talks or face dire consequences. RENAMO leadership has already announced their support for the process and has endorsed the idea of peace talks in the hours after the announcement. However FRELIMO has yet to comment on the ultimatum. Cuba has strongly condemned the ultimatum and has vowed to support FRELIMO in an armed confrontation with the United States. While several other socialist and African nations have condemned the ultimatum, the majority of the international community has remained tepidly apathetic over the situation in Mozambique. Meanwhile, Pretoria has announced their strong support for RENAMO and their desire for stabilizing the region."
 MZB_CIA80.19:0 "The Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) announced their opposition to peace negotiations with Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) to bring about a peaceful end to the nation’s civil war. This comes in response to American President [USA.GetLeader]’s ultimatum to both parties in the conflict to agree to peace negotiations or face significant consequences. In a defiant speech, {MZB.GetLeader], the leader of FRELIMO gave a fiery speech declaring that FRELIMO will fight to the end against the American imperialists and their lapdogs in RENAMO. Concerns have been raised at the United Nations about a potential American invasion in light of the failed ultimatum. While President [USA.GetLeader] has yet to comment on the ongoing development, the Pentagon released a statement noting that all options were on the table."
 MZB_CIA80.21:0 "A U.S.-brokered peace deal has officially ended Mozambique’s 15-year civil war, which claimed nearly a million lives and displaced millions. The agreement, signed by the Mozambican government and RENAMO rebels, marks a breakthrough in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the nation.\n\nThe war, which began shortly after Mozambique’s independence from Portugal, left the country devastated. The conflict severely damaged the economy and caused widespread suffering, with the government and RENAMOengaged in a brutal struggle for control.\n\nThe peace deal, facilitated by U.S. diplomats and supported by the United Nations, includes provisions for the disarmament of RENAMO fighters, political representation, and future elections. An amnesty clause was also agreed upon to promote reconciliation.\n\nInternational leaders have praised the deal, with the U.S. Secretary of State calling it "a victory for diplomacy." Mozambique now faces the challenge of rebuilding, but this agreement provides the hope of lasting peace and recovery."
 MZB_CIA80.23:0 "Following the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) rejection of peace talks in regard to the ongoing civil war, the United States has initiated an invasion in Mozambique. Forces of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) have also launched a major renewed offensive against FRELIMO positions throughout the nation, now supported by American airpower. The invasion has been widely condemned by a swathe of nations, most vocally by the Soviet Union and East Germany. Cuba has vowed to provide military advisors and material to FRELIMO but has yet to decide whether to involve themselves further, especially with Cuba already participating in the conflicts in Angola and Ethiopia. Domestic critics have argued that this could turn into another Vietnam, however anti-communist organizations and supporters of RENAMO have advocated that the situation is completely different and the American military is more suited to such operations today."
