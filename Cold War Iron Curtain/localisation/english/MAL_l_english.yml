 ########### MAL INFANTRY
 
 MAL_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Lee–Enfield Rifle, No. 5 Mk I, Jungle Carbine"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle No. 5 Mk I"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Jungle Carbine was a lightweight, shortened version of the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I, chambered in .303 British. Developed during World War II for jungle warfare, it was about 100mm (3.9 inches) shorter and nearly a kilogram (2.2 pounds) lighter than the standard rifle. \nThe rifle featured a rubber buttpad, which helped with grip but increased recoil with Its iron sights were designed for both close-range and longer distances, making it ideal for maneuverability in dense terrain. Produced between 1944 and 1947, the Jungle Carbine was favored for its effectiveness in jungle combat."

 MAL_infantry_equipment_1:0 "L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "L1A1 SLR"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "L1A1 Self-loading Rifle is a British variant of the FN FAL, a 7.62x51mm NATO battle rifle. Known for its durability and reliability, the L1A1 was widely used by Commonwealth nations during the Cold War. In Malaysia, it saw extensive service with the Malaysian Royal Army during the Malayan Emergency and Konfrontasi periods, where its semi-automatic fire and long-range accuracy proved effective in jungle warfare. The L1A1 was prized for its ruggedness in harsh conditions and remained in Malaysian military service until the 1980s when it was replaced by more modern rifles."

 MAL_infantry_equipment_2:0 "SME Ordnance M-16"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "M-16"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Malaysian M-4 Carbine is a locally produced version of the American Colt M4 Carbine, a lightweight, 5.56x45mm NATO assault rifle. Manufactured by SME Ordnance ,this carbine is used by the Malaysian Armed Forces and special operations units. With its shorter barrel and compact design, the M-4 is ideal for close-quarters combat and urban operations. It offers both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes, making it versatile for a range of missions. The Malaysian M-4 has become a staple in the country’s modernization of its military forces."

 MAL_infantry_equipment_3:0 "SME Ordnance M-4 Carbine"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "M-4 Carbine"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a forward assist and corresponding notches in the bolt carrier. The M16A1 was the finalized production model in 1967 and was produced until 1982. To address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, bird-cage flash suppressor replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced."

 MAL_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Carbine, Caliber 5.56 mm, M4 "
 MAL_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "M4 Carbine"
 MAL_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M4 carbine is a further improvement on the M16A2. It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."
