Its iron sights were adjustable up to 800 meters, merging the precision of the L1 with the durability needed for jungle warfare.

 SWK_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M4 carbine is a further improvement on the M16A2. It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."
