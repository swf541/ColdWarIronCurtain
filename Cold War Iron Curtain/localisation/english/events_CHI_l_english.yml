 chi.1.t:0 "Accept the PRC to the UN"
 chi.1.d:0 "The People's Republic of China wants to be recognized as the successor of the Republic of China by the United Nations. The Republic of China's Kuomintang government has fled to Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China controls the mainland. Should we advocate giving the Republic of China-Taiwan's seat to the People's Republic of China?"
 chi.1.a:0 "Yes, of course!"
 chi.1.b:0 "No, they shall stay out."
 
 CHI_KOR.0.d:0 "The endless ambition of our mortal enemy in Beijing has claimed yet another victim; the fledgling Republic of Korea, long beset by the agitating of Kim Ill Sung, has collapsed into civil war, with Mao Zedong's revolution no doubt backing Sung's forces in the North as a means to combat the incoming support from the United States, themselves en route to back the republican government in Seoul; it's a situation we patriotic Chinese know this kind of conflict all to well.\n\nThe world's eyes fall on Asia once more as the Korean Civil War escalates, and the Republic of China will not stand by as the Red Menace strikes at the good people of Korea from their stronghold in Pyongyang.\n\nChiang Kai-Shek has already sent word to the President of America, offering military assistance to both America and Korea against the Sung Regime."  
 CHI_KOR.1.d:0 "Our recent decision to involve ourselves in the civil war in Korea has caught the attention of the enemies of the PRC and their backing of Kim Ill Sung; The Republic of China in Taiwan and the remnants of the Kuomintang have extended on offer to join the US Army in fighting against the North Korean Army.\n\nWhile any attempt to impede the Red Tide in Asia is welcome, choosing to involve Taiwan might incense the government in Beijing, possibly prompting an invasion from Manchuria"
 CHI_KOR.2.d:0 "The official correspondence from Washington D.C has relayed to us that US government has signed off on the proposal from Chiang Kai-Shek, and that the United States Army shall work in concert with the Kuomintang Army in a combined effort against the North Korean Army!"
 CHI_KOR.3.d:0 "The official correspondence from Washington D.C has informed Chiang Kai-Shek of the Presidents wishes for the Republic of China not to intervene in the Korean Civil War, citing fears that any military incursion from Taiwan would invoke military reprisal from Beijing, potentially escalating the war to a international crisis."
 CHI_KOR.4.d:0 "\nWith the outbreak of the civil war in Korea, it is only natural that the enemies of the asian communist bloc supporting the communist revolt in Pyongyang would seek to join the fighting; not even a year since the Chinese Civil War have the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan decided, once again, to take up arms against the Chinese Red Army backing Kim Ill Sung in North Korea.\n\nAfter recent correspondence between ROC President Chiang Kai-Shek in Taipei and American President Harry Truman in Washington, the United States have given the green light for the Kuomintang Army to aid the US Army in Korea, believing their experiences against Red Chinese forces would be of immense help against the threat they face."
 CHI_KOR_TT:0 "[CHI.GetNameDef] will officially join the Korean War against the communist aggressors."
