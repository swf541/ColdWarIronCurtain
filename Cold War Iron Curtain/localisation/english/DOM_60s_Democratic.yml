DOM_VF_Constitution_Assembly_Call.1.d:0 "During his annual speech in El Malecon of Santo Domingo, President Viriato Fiallo has finally decreed what the people has long waited. The formation of a Constitutional Assembly led by members of the National Congress with the task of finally replacing the 1955 "Trujillo Constitution" which granted almost infinite powers to the presidency, will finally resolved the public's angers and fears of a repetitive government led by Fiallo. Although unpopular, this actions have granted him enough leverage to deal with the Bosch's political opposition and his 'Socialist' ideas. This has turned out to be satisfactory enough for the establishment after at least two years of negotiations inside the National Civic Union about how to bring about the constitutional assembly and, after some legal changes, Congress, which has a NCU political majority, will be ahead of the constitutional process. 

The leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, Juan Bosch, already voiced his concerns about the transparency of the process and called for the formation of a special congressional committee to oversee the amendments while he has called his followers to go out to the streets to demand equal rights, electoral reforms, check and balances, as well as decreasing the insane amount of political power that the Presidency holds.
"
DOM_VF_Constitution Assembly_Formed.1.d:0 "After pressure from inside the NCU's political leadership, the Constitutional Assembly has been formed. 60% of the seats are occupied by loyal supporters of the NCU while only 40% is occupied by opposition members. Juan Bosch called to effectively boycott the process as he argued that the Assembly started too fast and too quickly, without guaranteeing enough safeguards for the whole process yet, Bosch's party, the PRD, has called for participation in the process amid of the public's interest to see how this process plays out.

While Bosch openly opposed the process and decided to bare no participation into it, some internal faces of the PRD decided to oversee the situation. The Party is led by Antonio Guzman, a renowned opposition leader and close friend of Juan Bosch, who was raised in a wealthy family and studied abroad. He has argued that, even though the process might seem compromised by its lacks of safeguards, it is important for the political opposition to participate in the democratic process to pursue "peace and normalization of the constitutional liberties" granted after the death of 'The Tyrant' in 1961. 
"
DOM_VF_1965C_Approved.1.d:0 "President Viriato Fiallo assisted an extraordinary event within the halls of the National Congress for the signing of the new constitution. The new constitution has been revealed to the public after months of private inquiries and debates in which little information was given out. The PRD constantly declared in the media their discontent to the results of the constitution and that they, "did not trust" in the changes given to it. The constitution presented the same proposals of always such as maintaining Trujillo's bicameral Congress, maintain most powers held by the presidency, and reaffirming the role of the Church on states matters. One of the positive additions was the establishment of three consecutive terms for a president, which in the past, was an unlimited amount of them and, although some rights were given, and there were some improvements in the judicial system as well as separating some powers of the military to give it to civilian authorities, Bosch declared that the, "New Constitution is just a mimic of Trujillo's." 

The new articles established elections to be held by 1966 and the erase of past political terms. For many, this was just another political tool of the NCU to grasp more power and has been heavily condemned by the public since.

DOM_VF_1965C_Failed.1.d:0 "Fiallo was defeated in Congress after he decided to go for a more liberal constitution instead of going for the united proposal given by his party. This political defeat has come costly, as he did not obtain enough votes to pass the constitution. He was able to align the liberal members of the NCU which included Unionists and firm Anti-Trujillists, but did not obtain the support of the wide political establishment of his party. The vote resulted in a mere 46 votes against the 34 in favor in Congress, not passing the required 60% votes needed for approval or 48 votes. 

The public is outraged for the useless waste of their time. Instead, the so-called "Constitutional Assembly" decided to approve a "secondary draft" on the later days which reaffirmed the constitution of 1955 with some minor changes in the President's powers by increasing those of the National Congress as many members of the NCU have viewed the betrayal of Fiallo as unacceptable for the party's near future and many have raised their voices for his expulsion of the party, including his political rival Francisco A. Lora. 

Bosch declared, "the dogs are fighting for the leftovers" while affirming the PRD's firm position on changing the constitution and bring about the necessary changes for a more democratic Dominican Republic.

DOM_VF_Independence_Day_Riots.1.d:0 "During the Independence Day of 1965, a day of usual joy and military parades, the President Fiallo has been forced to stay in the National Palace amid protests and riots that have erupted earlier in that morning. The public is infuriated with the complete dismissal of the promises given with the end of the 30 years of Trujillo and have been delivered vague, insufficient reforms that have done nothing but cause additional stress to the popular psyche. Adding to this, Juan Bosch called for a national strike and massive riots against the presidency.

Counting immense damages and heavy disgust of the traditional elites, President Fiallo, in an attempt to finally appease the NCU, decided to issue an arrest order against Bosch for 'instigating' treason and chaos. However, Bosch found refuge in the American embassy and was able to escape to Puerto Rico not long after it. The riots of February increase the paranoia of the NCU which has issued arrests and their popularity has exponentially decreased as there are sentiments of change floating in the Dominican Republic."
DOM_VF_April_Revolution.1.d:0 "After years since the 1963 election, many Dominicans have been faced with the presidency of Viriato Fiallo. He is a man of business who, during the times of Trujillo, gained great wealth through kneeling to the dictator by being a loyal vassal of his terror. Nowadays, he claimed to be a democratic leader with new intentions of progress and to finally resolve the long time problems of the nation. However, after calling for a failed attempt of truly bringing constitutional changes, the popular opinion have shifted heavily against him. 

Secretly, both Juan Bosch and Balaguer met in their exile in Puerto Rico and quickly came to terms. Although politically unaligned, they were both in favor of dismantling the clearly undemocratic successors of Trujillo, the NCU and finally came to the decision that the only way was through arms. They joined factions and called for the followers in the Dominican military and political life to come together for a solution. They decided to form a new force of Balaguerists officers and young liberal officers, naming themselves as the "San Cristobal Clan"  and deciding to initiate a violent overthrow of the regime.

However, by early morning of April 24, agents of Fiallo's government in the military unveiled the plot quickly alerted General Wessin y Wessin and President Fiallo of the imminent treason. However, it was too late for the authorities as the reDOMs were already armed and prepared. Colonel Fernandez Dominguez assaulted the National Police HQ and the Armory of Santo Domingo and distributed weapons among members of Leftists organizations, the PRD, and the general civilian population."
