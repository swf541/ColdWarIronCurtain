 AFG_Revolution.1.d:0 "Since assuming office, Prime Minister Daoud Khan, has long agitated for Pashtunistan and the liberation of Pashtuns in Afghanistan. This has garnered him popularity within the military and Kabul elite but has alienated support from the non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan. An ambitious military commander has proposed an operation to send a small number of troops into the Pakistani Tribal Areas, this will cause the heavily armed tribes there to join our forces. Together, we can then secure the Pashtunistan dream. Since 1947 the Pakistan military evacuated their forces from the Tribal Areas and their focus on the Indian border means our forces can enter with little resistance. The military commander claims the operation will be an easy maneuver that will resolve the Pashtunistan crisis decisively in our favor."
 AFG_Revolution.2.d:0 "A force of soldiers from Afghanistan recently crossed into the Tribal Areas of Pakistan in order to instigate an uprising against the Pakistani state. However, the operation ended in abject failure as local tribes loyal to Pakistan attacked the Afghans, buying time for Pakistani forces, including air power to arrive and drive off the infiltrators. This is the latest provocation by the government of Prime Minister Daoud Khan against Pakistan. Initially the Afghan government stated the attack was launched by passionate Pashtun tribesmen seeking to free their compatriots, but the Pakistan military paraded captured Afghan soldiers and documents to the media to disprove the claim. The King of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah is said to be privately infuriated by the actions of his cousin."
 AFG_Revolution.3.d:0 "The recent incursion of Afghan soldiers in the Tribal Areas along with the relentless Pashtunistan propaganda coming out of Kabul has infuriated the Pakistani government. It has decided to retaliate by initiating a blockade of land trade into Afghanistan. The vast majority of imports to Afghanistan come from Pakistani ports and this decision will likely cripple the Afghan economy unless it finds new trade routes. The announcement triggered angry Afghan protests at Pakistani diplomatic sites across the country. Prime Minister Daoud Khan called the decision an act of war and stated Afghanistan would have to look to its other neighbors for support, hinting at widening ties with the Soviets. This has caused the Americans to urge a restoration of peace in both countries as they fear the Soviets using the tension to gain a foothold in Afghanistan."
 AFG_Revolution.4.d:0 "Prime Minister Daoud Khan has recently resigned to King Zahir Shah following a tumultuous last few years in office. The deep dedication and devotion to the Pashtunistan issue by the Prime Minister made him incredibly popular among the Afghan Pashtuns. However, his failures to achieve a resolution on the matter and the Pakistani economic blockade has greatly hurt the economy. This has eroded support for the Prime Minister by the large non-Pashtun ethnic groups. With his popularity waning and the economy declining, the Prime Minister asked the King for expanded executive powers. For King Zahir Shah this was the last straw and he demanded the resignation. Soon after the resignation was announced, the Pakistan government stated it was lifted the economic blockade on Afghanistan. Despite his recent troubles, Daoud Khan remains popular and many are now accusing the King of removing the Prime Minister at the behest of Pakistan."
 AFG_Revolution.5.d:0 "King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan officially approved a new constitution for the country. The document expands democratic rights and turns the country into a parliamentary monarchy. The constitution is meant to gradually prepare Afghans for democracy. As part of its provisions, no royal family members can serve as ministers. This provision is seen as a direct attack on Daoud Khan, a cousin of the King. Despite his popularity and the new constitution effectively bars him from power. The constitution effectively creates an elected lower house of parliament that will check royal appointments. Although the document is being hailed as progressive, some observers question whether the document will simply create conflict between the parliament and council of ministers as each seeks to assert itself over the other."
 AFG_Revolution.6.d:0 "While King Zahir Shah was recovering from medical operations in Italy, his cousin, the former Prime Minister Daoud Khan seized power in a bloodless coup. The Afghan military conducted the coup, quickly seizing key government buildings and the media. Within hours Daoud Khan addressed the nation stating the years of weak government and elite collusion were over. He proclaimed Afghanistan would now be a Republic, with him as the head of state. King Zahir Khan has not responded yet and their does not appear to be any countercoup taking place. Daoud Khan has long been popular in the military for his generous funding to them as Prime Minister and his brand of nationalism has long resonated among the people, especially the large ethnic Pashtun population. With a strong base of popularity and the support of the military, Daoud Khan appears firmly in power."
 AFG_Revolution.7.d:0 "From his exile in Italy, King Zahir Khan of Afghanistan announced he would abdicate his throne and not contest the new regime in Kabul. A month ago, while the King underwent medical operations in Italy, his cousin and former Prime Minister, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup in Kabul. Daoud Khan proclaimed the country a republic and abolished the monarchy. It appears the King realized his situation had grown untenable. The military had joined Daoud Khan almost completely. In addition, there were no major public uprisings or protests against the coup indicating the people largely supported the new regime. Although it appears the King has been abandoned by the people, many are viewing his decision to abdicate as a gesture to ensure peace in the lives of his subjects. He is expected to remain in Italy for the foreseeable future."
 AFG_Revolution.8.d:0 "In stunning news from Kabul, the editor of the PDPA daily newspaper Parcham, Mir Akbar Khyber, was assassinated by a team of assassins near his home. Khyber, widely seen as the leader of the Parcham faction within the PDPA, is also deeply respected within the rival Khalq faction for his historical role as an ideologue and founder of the party. President Daoud quickly blamed Islamic militants for the attack, but many PDPA members are already pointing at the Daoud government which recently turned on its Parchamite allies. Daoud recently started to remove PDPA members from the government and has publicly stated his intention to reverse some of the socialist reforms he promised the PDPA. Although no one has claimed responsibility, rumors are everywhere, some experts posit it might have been members of Khalq hoping to force a total break between the Parchamites and Daoud. Still many Afghans are also blaming the Americans or Soviets for the attack."
 AFG_Revolution.9.d:0 "The funeral of prominent PDPA leader and Afghan communist ideologue Mir Akbar Khyber saw over fifteen thousand PDPA members march onto the streets of Kabul. Khyber, the editor of a prominent leftist newspaper, was recently assassinated near his home by unknown assailants. Although President Daoud condemned the attack and blamed Islamic militants, the angry PDPA mourners chanted anti-government and anti-American slogans. Many believe it was the government working with the Americans who killed Khyber. Prominent PDPA members speaking at the funeral echoed these sentiments which fueled the angry chanting. The funeral demonstrated to President Daoud the power of the PDPA and its infiltration of the military meant soldiers could not be deployed. President Daoud must either purge the PDPA, arrest its main leaders who addressed the funeral, or re-invite the Parchamites to the government and initiate a very gradual socialist transformation for Afghanistan." 

 AFG_War.1.d:0 "Days after the funeral of Mir Akbar Khyber, the government launched crackdown on the PDPA and many prominent PDPA leaders were imprisoned. However, instead of breaking the PDPA, the actions pushed the Parcham and Khalq factions to work together. Hafizullah Amin, a Khalq leader and the most prominent PDPA member not imprisoned, organized supporters in the government and military. When the Daoud government arrested senior leader Nur Muhammad Taraki, this led the military to take immediate action. PDPA supporters within the military led tanks and troops to seize the Defense Ministry and Presidential Palace. President Daoud refused to surrender and heavy street fighting took place as his Presidential Guard fought back. However, once pro-PDPA pilots killed their commander and flew fighter planes to bomb the loyalists, resistance quickly crumbled. President Daoud, his family, and loyal officials were all killed and soon after the Afghan military announced the end of monarchial rule in Afghanistan."
 AFG_War.2.d:0 "Within days of the military taking over the country, it announced the handover of power to the PDPA controlled Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Nur Muhammad Taraki was elected President and Prime Minister. Prominent leaders such as Hafizullah Amin and Babrak Karmal of the Parcham faction were given the title of Vice President. The Khalq faction within the PDPA is clearly in charge, but they are ruling with the Parcham faction as some ministries were given to its members. The new government quickly proclaimed its devotion to Islam, belief in democracy, and claimed a policy of positive neutrality with its neighbors. Considering the number of communists within the party, the bloodiness of the coup and purges of PDPA opponents, many observers question the sincerity of these stated beliefs. However, experts in the West believe Taraki represents a nationalist government as opposed to communist and are willing to wait and see."
 AFG_War.3.d:0 "The brief alliance between the Khalqists and Parchamites within the PDPA recently ended. The Afghan President, Nur Muhammad Taraki ordered the mass arrest and purges of Parcham members within the government and military. Parcham leader Barbrak Karmal is staying abroad. It appears President Taraki acted under pressure from his colleagues from the Khalq faction who saw the Parchamites as unwilling to take the radical revolutionary steps needed for the country. In order to ensure a successful revolution, they argued the Parcham must be removed. The mass arrests and rumored executions are said to be angering the military and leading to a deeper polarization within units. Soviet efforts to reconcile both factions in recent weeks obviously failed and Moscow is said to be upset with Taraki over his purge."
 AFG_War.4.d:0 "The Afghan government under President Nur Muhammad Taraki announced an aggressive land redistribution campaign meant to break the big landlords and provide peasants their own lands. However, after six months, the government quietly ended this program as it proved a failure. The government had announced a limit on the amount of land one could own, extra lands were to be redistributed to peasants with no compensation to previous owners. The rapidity of the reform combined with a lack of surveys and planning saw landowners use loopholes to keep their profitable lands and many peasant families take over lands of poor agricultural value. The number of crops harvested plummeted and many peasants are living on lands that cannot sustain even their families. Although the government publicly claimed the campaign was a success, many Afghan peasants are infuriated and more impoverished due to the government policy."
 AFG_War.5.d:0 "Several months ago, as part of a campaign to enlighten Afghanistan and advance the social development of the people, Afghan President Nur Muhammad Taraki initiated several reforms regarding marriage. Specifically, the practice of bride purchasing has been forbidden. This reform has provoked an angry backlash, especially among the traditional, rural population of Afghanistan. They believe all the practices are part of Afghan customs and Islam. The government is accused of targeting Afghan culture and religion. Analysts blame the backlash on the drastic nature of the reforms and a refusal of the PDPA to work with rural and religious leaders before announcing them. Muslim scholars in Kabul note the reforms, especially the ban on bride purchasing could easily be religiously justified, as Islam forbid the practice, but the government ignored involving them and are now accused of being anti-religion."
 AFG_War.6.d:0 "The continuous purges since the Saur Revolution eroded military support for President Nur Muhammad Taraki. The rapid attempt of his regime to transform Afghanistan into a modern socialist state alienated the countryside to the point that armed rebels roam across the provinces. In Herat, the arrest and brutal interrogation of several senior officers provoked their men into staging a mutiny. When other units were sent to quell the mutiny, they joined in. Soon the local rebels joined the mutinous soldiers and seized Herat. Soviet military advisors and their families present in the city were massacred. With Soviet aid, the government response was coordinated by Vice President Hafizullah Amin who sent a large military force. After heavy fighting, which included extensive government airstrikes on the rebels, the city was retaken. Although most of the mutineers and rebels were killed, a large number managed to escape and are already joining other rebel forces in the countryside."
 AFG_War.7.d:0 "The Afghan government of President Nur Muhammad Taraki took a major blow when it lost control of Herat to rebels. The city was lost after several army units mutinied, joined local rebels, and killed government loyalists. In the process, Soviet advisors and their families were also slaughtered by the rebels. Our advisors in Kabul helped the government response and we ensured the rebels were properly dealt with when the government forces retook the city. However, this incident indicates the situation in Afghanistan is growing increasingly chaotic. Although President Taraki is devoted to transforming his country along socialist lines, he is moving far too rapidly for the people. In addition, he has proven to be paranoid and his purges are narrowing his own base of support. We will have to watch the situation closely as we have invested heavily in the country and cannot afford to see one weak ruler destroy all we and the Afghan people hope to achieve."
 AFG_War.8.d:0 "Following the disaster in Herat, Afghan President Nur Muhammad Taraki was pushed to appoint Hafizullah Amin as Prime Minister. The rising star of Amin has caused a division within the ruling Khalqists faction of the PDPA. Amin has been consolidating his own base of support within the military and his elevation to Prime Minister indicates the power struggle is not going in the favor of President Taraki. This has made the Soviets concerned as Amin appears more independent than Takari by making overtures to Washington and questioning Soviet influence over Kabul. More significantly, he has resisted attempts by the Soviets to mediate between himself and Taraki. The Soviets fear their rivalry for power only weakens the regime. Much to the chagrin of the Soviets, during a recent international trip by President Taraki, Hafizullah Amin managed to remove four of his loyalists from the military, escalating tensions between both men."
 AFG_War.9.d:0 "The conflict within the ruling Khalq faction of the PDPA between President Nur Muhammad Taraki and Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin ended today. Tensions recently escalated following a Central Committee meeting in which the President proposed a new coalition government be established with the Parchamites to reunite the PDPA. Taraki was carrying out the recommendations of Moscow but Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin opposed these suggestions, rallied his supporters and blocked the President. This infuriated Taraki and the Soviets. The President then tried to remove Amin from office by posting him abroad as an ambassador, Amin refused. Finally, Taraki invited Amin to the Presidential Palace to resolve the crisis. A suspicious Amin mobilized his military allies and upon arriving, he and his supporters were fired upon. Amin escaped in his car and the military quickly acted by detaining Taraki and his allies in the Khalq faction."
 AFG_War.10.d:0 "With President Nur Muhammad Taraki removed from power, Hafizullah Amin quickly took the position of President. His ascension to power was quickly confirmed within Afghanistan and by the Soviets who urged him to slow the pace of socialist transformation and expand his base of support by unifying the PDPA. Instead, President Amin annoyed Moscow by asking they replace their ambassador to Kabul. He also expanded the purges, further crippling the Afghan government and military, this time targeting Taraki supporters. Defections and unrest have only increased. Amin refuses to slow reforms and will not open talks with the Parcham faction or the Taraki loyalists within the PDPA party. On top of all this, his government recently announced the death of former President Taraki from illness, though most accounts suggest he was strangled to death on the orders of Amin, ending any hope of a reconciliation."
 AFG_War.11.d:0 "The Soviet government and PDPA party leaders feared the purges and radical reforms of former President Nur Muhammad Taraki were pushing Afghanis too hard, however, hopes that his successor, President Hafizullah Amin would slow the deterioration has evaporated. Instead of reaching out to the Parcham faction or trying to reconcile with supporters of former President Taraki, Amin has instead intensified the scope and violence of his purge against both groups. His execution of Taraki not only intensified PDPA divisions but infuriated the Soviets who desperately wanted a reconciliation. Outside the messy power struggles, the countryside appears to be almost completely lost to the government. The military is largely crippled due to the purges and politicization of its officers. In addition, many soldiers are defecting to the rebels bringing them weapons, modern tactics, and intelligence. Many PDPA leaders in Kabul are begging the Soviets for help in preventing the collapse of the government."
 AFG_War.12.d:0 "The reports from Afghanistan are incredibly troubling. The military largely ceases to function as President Hafizullah Amin oversees a campaign of mass bloodletting against rival leftists. All this has allowed hostile states to fund and direct rebels who now run almost the entire countryside. We have invested heavily in Afghanistan and nurtured a devoted cadre of Afghan communists waiting for proper leadership. We recently received a proposal from the more moderate Parcham faction of the PDPA. They suggest we help the people of Afghanistan remove Amin and his violent cabal from power and bring the Parchamites in. The Parchamites claim they will end the infighting, establish a coalition government, and restore the trust of the people with the government. The decision is ours now, should we deploy Soviet military forces to remove Amin and save socialism in Afghanistan, or allow it to collapse and risk a new anti-Soviet regime on our border."
 AFG_War.13.d:0 "After careful planning, we launched the operation to secure Afghanistan and remove the tyrant Hafizullah Amin. The Afghan military has greatly deteriorated due to the rise of rebels and the waves of purges launched by the Amin regime. Our advisors within these units successfully locked up weapons, put heavy weaponry in maintenance, and insured important officers were at parties the night of our intervention. In Kabul, we successfully airlifted elite airborne troops who quickly moved to secure key buildings and the airport. President Amin was hosting a lavish party at the Tajbeg Palace outside Kabul. A special forces and KGB strike team led the assault, successfully overpowering the Presidential Guard and ending the life of the cruel tyrant. As this occurred, two divisions of our troops crossed the border and rapidly began occupying major towns and cities. We faced no resistance and no doubt the Afghan military happily welcome our help."
 AFG_War.14.d:0 "With Afghanistan secured by Soviet troops, Babrak Karmal quickly appeared in Kabul and was proclaimed the new President of Afghanistan. Although President Karmal claimed he had been in the country for months secretly working against the tyrannical regime of President Amin, most observers believe Moscow flew him in once their forces secured Kabul. President Karmal thanked the Soviets for accepting the invitation of the Afghan government and people to help them in their difficult time. He has already promised the release of political prisoners and a general amnesty. In addition, he promised to establish democratic institutions, and hold elections soon. His announcement is being praised among the PDPA supporters exhausted by the years of infighting, however many Afghans are skeptical these lofty promises can be kept while Soviet troops remain. Already opponents are portraying President Karmal as an illegitimate puppet and are calling for an immediate Soviet withdrawal."
 AFG_War.15.d:0 "The Soviet government decided in a recent Central Committee Meeting the plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan. The accepted plan will see Soviet troops leave with dignity at having established friendly and stable government for the people of Afghanistan. Soviet troops have no doubt done their duty and beyond, but the time has come for the people of Afghanistan to carry the fight. The first phase will see the fighting shift from Soviet soldiers to Afghan soldiers. The next phase calls for the Afghan government to launch a policy of reconciliation and broaden its base of support by bringing in former enemies. Finally, the Soviet Union will work to grant the Afghan government international recognition and cutoff foreign aid to the Mujahideen."
 AFG_War.16.d:0 "The Soviet military confirmed its forces were no longer conducting active combat operations against rebel fighters in Afghanistan. The Soviet military added it would respond if attacked but that combat operations were now to be led by the Afghans themselves. The Afghan military will still be able to call on Soviet artillery, airpower, and logistical support for its own operations. The Soviets indicated even this support will slowly be reduced as the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan finds its footing. Analysts note the Afghan military has been notorious for its desertion rates and weakening since the Soviet intervention, but a huge influx of arms and new cash incentives are expected shortly. The Soviets hope this support will jumpstart the military."
 AFG_War.17.d:0 "The Soviet government and intelligence leaders have long concluded that President Babrak Karmal, though loyal to the Soviet Union, has used Soviet aid to solidify his hold in Kabul and he lacks an interest in bringing about national unity in Afghanistan. The Afghan intelligence chief, Mohammad Najibullah has proven to be a very efficient official. He has impressed Soviet observers and his status as a religious, rural Pashtun leader means he could appeal to most Mujahideen. Although President Karmal resisted, he did eventually agree to put Najibullah in the Secretariat and turn the intelligence department into its own ministry."
 AFG_War.18.d:0 "Recently, the Soviet Union utilized diplomatic pressure and its advisors across Kabul to influence Afghan President Babrak Karmal to accept Mohammad Najibullah takeover as General Secretary of the PDPA party. Within weeks, Najibullah claimed collective leadership had been established with him and Karmal who retained several senior posts. The Soviets are happy with this shift and urge Najibullah to slowly consolidate power to preserve the dignity of Karmal. However, within the PDPA it has become clear that Karmal retains quite a bit of influence and Najibullah is largely dependent on his control of the large, ruthless, and efficient intelligence apparatus. Whether this will lead to future conflict is currently unknown."
 AFG_War.19.d:0 "The Soviets had urged Mohammad Najibullah to slowly wean Babrak Karmal out of power out of respect for his loyalty to the Soviet Union. However, Najibullah now claims that after months of tensions, the situation is untenable. Recently, he provided evidence showing Karmal was privately and publicly undermining him and had recently claimed he would soon return as General Secretary. Najibullah also added that Karmal is largely opposed to his ideas for National Reconciliation and is using his support within the party to criticize him. This last bit of information directly hinders Soviet efforts at a successful withdrawal, and they gave permission for Najibullah to act. Several days after getting approval, during a PDPA meeting, Najibullah had the party strip Karmal of his party titles. Babrak Karmal then accepted a Soviet offer to go into exile in Moscow where he will receive funds and an apartment. Najibullah is now firmly in control."
 AFG_War.20.d:0 "Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah recently announced a policy of National Reconciliation. He stated the new constitution will limit Presidential power, be inclusive and promised PDPA membership was not a requirement to hold ministries. In his address, Najibullah made five offers. One was the immediate ceasefire of government forces who would only fight back if attacked by rebels. His second offer was to offer power-sharing with what he called counter-revolutionary forces. Third was a general amnesty to enemy fighters, while the fourth and fifth promises were guarantees that the government will respect Afghan culture and adhere to Islam. To further distance the regime from communism, he also renamed the country the Republic of Afghanistan. The new policy is being praised by the Soviets as a means to incorporate the opposition into the government ranks. However, many PDPA members are criticizing it for betraying party values and many Mujahideen groups are expected to reject it."
 AFG_War.21.d:0 "Ahmad Shah Massoud has long been a thorn to the Soviets and the Afghan government. His exploits in defending Panjshir valley and media interviews have made him a national figure. Recently Massoud held secret talks with Soviet intelligence about a ceasefire. Massoud has indicated he is willing to halt fighting as long as Soviet and government forces remain outside Panjshir and its surrounding areas. The Soviets have asked President Mohammad Najibullah to agree with this ceasefire, and if it sticks, this may pave the way for Massoud and his allies to even join the government. However, if Najibullah accepts a ceasefire and essentially gives Massoud free reign in his lands, he risks alienating the hardliners in the PDPA."
 AFG_War.22.d:0 "The ceasefire between the Afghan government and militant commander Ahmad Shah Massoud remains intact. The lull in the fighting has allowed Afghan units in the area to regroup and commanders on the ground are asking permission to launch new offensives against Massoud. These commanders, along with hardliners in in the PDPA argue the current ceasefire makes the government look weak and if Massoud decides to target withdrawing Soviet troops when the time comes it would be disastrous. On the other hand, Massoud apparently is willing to accept a cabinet position and join the government if offered. Bringing Massoud on would stabilize a part of the country and help support the National Reconciliation program, however, many PDPA leaders fear such moves will lead to end of their party and regime."
 AFG_War.23.d:0 "The Iranians are sponsoring several alleged parties of resistance fighters. However, these men are generally foreigners and are mostly engaged in banditry. They make the situation in western Afghanistan very difficult and tie down a lot of our forces. As part of the recent National Reconciliation announcement, President Najibullah has asked his ministers whether he should use Soviet contacts and ask the Iranians to accept a ceasefire between government forces and these parties. Overtime we can eventually re-incorporate these leaders into the government and strengthen the country. Many cabinet members however, express dissatisfaction with the proposal as incorporating these parties would ultimately weaken the PDPA and the future of the regime."
 AFG_War.24.d:0 "The Kabul regime through Soviet intermediaries offered a ceasefire with the Mujahideen parties operating from our territory. After a six-month period, the party leaders will be incorporated int the central government while the fighters have the choice to join the Afghan military. The proposal, if accepted, would end the fighting along our border and we would no longer be involved in the fighting in Afghanistan. However, such a deal with cut us off of a role in determining the future of Afghanistan and this may lead to an anti-Iranian regime emerging. Our options are to persuade the parties to accept the ceasefire and wash our hands of Afghanistan, or to reject the offer and continue to support the Mujahideen who continue to advance towards ultimate victory."
 AFG_War.25.d:0 "Western Afghanistan has been relatively peaceful since the Iranian based Mujahideen parties and the Afghan government came to a ceasefire agreement. Now the time has arrived for the regime of President Mohammad Najibullah to incorporate these groups to the central government or risk restarting the fighting. Although Najibullah offered several minor posts to the parties, the Iranian-backed Mujahideen have countered by demanding more positions in the government and military. Accepting their demands will dilute PDPA power and influence but will go a long way in stabilizing the country. This would be the epitome of power-sharing and although the power of the center will be weakened, it may save the Afghan nation. The Soviets are eager for us to accept but many senior PDPA officials have expressed concern that incorporating the parties risks the future destruction of the PDPA in Kabul. It maybe the better option to end negotiations, restart fighting and force them to capitulate on our terms."
 AFG_War.26.d:0 "The largest and most brutal counter-revolutionary groups come from the so-called parties based in Pakistan. These groups enjoy foreign volunteers, aid, and training from Pakistani intelligence and military. These parties are mostly religious and traditionally vehemently opposed to our government. However, per the National Reconciliation plan, President Mohammad Najibullah is considering using Soviet aid in offering these groups a ceasefire and eventual incorporation in a power-sharing government. The decision now is whether to offer the ceasefire and hopefully bring stability to southern Afghanistan and the Kabul area or decline to. Opponents of the ceasefire within the PDPA warn incorporating these parties may make a unity government unstable. In addition, adding these mostly Pashtun groups to the government and military may lead to the eventual destruction of the PDPA."
 AFG_War.27.d:0 "Soviet agents have brought a proposal for the Mujahideen groups operating from Peshawar for a ceasefire and eventual incorporation with the government. We can either push the parties to accept and abide by the ceasefire or urge them to reject it. The Foreign Ministry suggests the incorporations of these parties may work to our benefit and lead to a more friendly government in Kabul. More importantly, such a scenario could ensure an end to the Pashtunistan issue permanently. However, senior military and intelligence officials are arguing against the ceasefire. They see the offer as an indication of the Kabul regime weakening and feel if the Mujahideen we support can eventually win than that will guarantee our objectives are met."
 AFG_War.28.d:0 "The six-month ceasefire has largely held with the Pakistani parties. This has brought a period of unprecedented peace in southern Afghanistan and Kabul. In negotiations over incorporating the parties, we did offer them a small percentage of seats and some ministerial force. However, they are demanding at least forty percent of the seats and some high-profile ministries. Some officials argue we should accept and bring them into the government to show the people it was the PDPA that brought peace, such popularity would help us in future elections. Others, especially the hardliners want to reject them and restart the fighting. They fear these parties will undermine Afghan sovereignty with their pro-Pakistani stance and fear the PDPA will end up becoming a minority party if more rebel groups get incorporated. The President must decide whether to incorporate these parties or to continue the war."
 AFG_War.29.d:0 "Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, and the Republic of Afghanistan signed a final agreement in Afghanistan to resolve the war. In the agreement, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to normalize relations and pledge non-interference. This meets the Soviet goal of legitimizing their client in Kabul. The Soviets agreed to a timetable on its withdrawal. In addition, the United States has pledged to halt support for Mujahideen groups in Afghanistan. The Soviets also are to cut off arms to the Republic of Afghanistan. Both the United States and Soviet Union have agreed to be guarantors of the agreement. Many are hailing the agreement as the beginning of peace for Afghanistan. However, observers note the Mujahideen were not allowed to participate and many are skeptical if they will honor the agreement."
 AFG_War.30.d:0 "The recently concluded Geneva Accords offers a timetable for Soviet withdrawal, the principal aim of our Afghan policy. The agreement also stipulates we halt the flow of arms to the Mujahideen. However, CIA and congressional leaders are urging us to allow the arms to continue, especially since the Pakistanis are willing to continue our operations. The Soviets for years undermined us across the world and caused the deaths of many of our citizens and allies. They argue we must continue to make them bleed for their actions. Others in the administration are urging us to follow through on our promises and bring the conflict to an end. They fear a continuation of arms may further destabilize Afghanistan and may lead to unforeseen consequences."
 AFG_War.31.d:0 "The recently concluded Geneva Accords on paper secured several of our goals in ensuring a dignified withdrawal for Afghanistan. We gave President Mohammad Najibullah and his government greater international legitimacy and secured a timetable for our withdrawal. The Americans and Pakistanis also agreed to cut funding off the Mujahideen. During the negotiations we promised Najibullah continued military aid to get him to sign. Now we must decide whether we will continue to provide military aid or not. Many of our military and intelligence advisors believe we should continue our arm Najibullah to preserve our commitments and ensure we leave behind a stable Afghanistan. They also doubt the Americans will honor their own commitments. Other advisors suggest abiding by the agreement and halting arm supplies. The Afghanistan experiment has proven too costly already and washing our hands maybe the best approach."
 AFG_War.32.d:0 "As per the Geneva Accords, our forces have begun their withdrawal of Afghanistan. As per the agreement, this is a front-loaded withdrawal. Over the two months more than half of our forces are back in Soviet territory. The final withdrawal phase is about to take place and will likely last an additional six or seven months. However, the withdrawal has not gone without incidents. Our forces have taken heavy fire at times from Mujahideen fighters. We have complained bitterly to the Americans and Pakistanis over these incidents, but they claim to have no sway over field commanders. Some in the Kremlin argue the increase in violence and deterioration of security means the Geneva Accords are being ignored and we should temporarily stop the withdrawal to force compliance. This is not a realistic option, but it was decided to give commanders permission to temporarily stop the withdrawal to pressure the enemy. In the end though, the Soviet Union will not halt the withdrawal."
 AFG_War.33.d:0 "The commander of our successful withdrawal operation was the last Soviet soldier to officially cross the Oxus and mark the end of our deployment in Afghanistan. The last withdrawal phase was completed although Mujahideen harassment continued. We did temporarily halt the withdrawal but the Mujahideen called our bluff and we had to resume. Despite these issues, we brought back our men safely and turned over bases and heavy equipment for the Republic of Afghanistan. This was the parting gift of our soldiers who completed their international duty. We hold our heads high as we leave the people of Afghanistan in a position of stability and the means to defend their way of life. Our own troops crossed the border in convoys, with smiles, and waving flags. We publicized this to local and international media to demonstrate we left on our own accord and not in disarray or defeat."
 AFG_War.34.d:0 "Surrounded by media, the last Soviet troops crossed the Oxus, marking the end of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet soldiers crossed the border with broad smiles and waving flags. Although the Soviets were conveying an image of triumphant soldiers returning home from a successful mission, reports from Afghanistan suggest these troops faced constant Mujahideen attacks. The security situation now lies in the hands of the Soviet-backed Republic of Afghanistan and it remains to be seen if they can handle the burden of fighting against the numerous Mujahideen groups and reunite a country ravaged by war. The United States welcomed the Soviet withdrawal, with many officials and congressional leaders calling it the end of a brutal foreign occupation. Many added the final liberation of Afghanistan would be the removal of the PDPA regime in Kabul. The Soviets were quick to criticize the American statements as irresponsible and open threats to the legitimate government of Afghanistan."
 AFG_PAK.24.d:0 "Today we received a letter from Afghanistan. In it they make a request to create an autonomous Pashtunistan area around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. After discussing about it with your cabinet, it was decided that..."

 Afghani_Coup.1.d:0 "The Hizb-i Sirri Ittihad is the only political party within our country that actually aims to establish a republic. They are a very diverse group and was founded in the late 1940s. They believe that a republican government was the only way to end the discrimination of ethnicity and religion in Afghanistan. We have now detected the alleged plan of a coup d'état during our Nowruz celebration in March. How do we handle this? Their motivations are connected to the worldview of their leaders, and our ethnic policies and Pashtunistan issue."
 Afghani_Coup.2.d:0 "The Hizb-i Sirri Ittihad have successfully executed a coup d'état, the monarchy has been deposed and we are establishing upcoming elections. Riots have broken out across the nation regarding the sudden regime change, and word is getting out onto the global stage of our recent actions. We have established a small provisional government with Ismael Balkhi at the helm before we hold elections and declare the first republic. Our top leaders are currently working on a new constitution that will include the principles of a republic. With party members across ethnic and sectarian lines, from all parts of our nation including north, west, and central, not only are we a democracy, but we are a diverse one representing all walks of life. No longer are we ruled by gods and kings, we are ruled by the principles of democracy so first made in ancient Greece. We shall rise from the ashes as the new Afghanistan."
 
 Afghanistan.1.d:0 "For the first time in many years, our Prime Minister, Shah Mahmud has allowed relatively free national assembly elections, and the resulting seventh Afghan Parliament shall be voted in, many parties that are running are much more moderate and liberal in their views, liberalism being a new ideology to come to the table in Afghanistan. A political philosophy originating in the west during the Age of Enlightenment. It is based on liberty, consent of the governed, and equality before the law . Many parties are planning on giving voice to criticism of our government, and traditional institutions, also allowing opposition political groups to come to life and planning on enacting liberal reforms such as freedom of the press."
 Afghanistan.2.d:0 "The Pashtunistan issue is one of the most important political developments in Afghanistan after World War II ended, the Durand Line was established after Afghanistan lost some territories to the east and south of Afghanistan that were inhabited by the Pashtuns in 1893. Since the 1947 Partition of India however, governments of Afghanistan have claimed the line was never meant to be an international boundary, and encouraged Pashtun communities to stage "excursions" across the border into their rightful territory, and such a disturbance has occurred when a group of Afghan Pashtun tribes invaded the Bogra pass, with the Afghan government denying that the invaders have comprised of Afghan troops. Due to the Afghan government's lack of cooperation, Pakistan has introduced a blockade on Afghanistan for trade and travel, but they are willing to negotiate to discuss economic and cultural questions of common concern to the two countries."

 HVA.1.d:0 "The Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA) based in Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan was established on December 4, 1952 as an agency of the Afghan Government. It was modelled on the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States, with a remit covering lands in Farah Province, Ghazni Province, Helmand Province, Herat Province, and Kandahar Province. The HAVA was created to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys, primarily through irrigation and agricultural land development along the Helmand River and the Arghandab River, in a plan which was forecast to be of primary importance to the future economy of Afghanistan."
 AFG_PM.1.d:0 "Shah Mahmud Khan's role as prime minister has brought a lot of our country in terms of progressive policies, such as free elections, but after his failed attempt at a highly ambitious irrigation scheme in western Afghanistan, severe economic decline in the last few months and tense relations with Pakistan, his time has come up and parliament has come up with a motion of no confidence, forcing his resignation. We now have a choice between Mohammed Daoud Khan, a progressive politician or Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar, who shall we choose?"
 SocDemAfg.1.d:0 "One of the major focuses of the prime minister was Shah Mahmud's experiment in greater political tolerance and liberalization. Encouraged by young, Western-educated members of the political elite, the prime minister allowed National Assembly elections that were distinctly less controlled than they had been in the past; the result was the "liberal parliament" of 1949. He tolerated the activity of opposition political groups. A newly formed student union not only provided a forum for political debate but also produced theatrical plays critical of Islam and the monarchy. Newspapers criticized the government, and many groups began demanding a more open political system. But the liberalization went farther than the prime minister or anyone could have intended, and so he began cracking down. The student union was dissolved in 1951; newspapers criticizing the government were closed down; many opposition leaders were jailed. The parliament that was elected in 1952 was a great step backwards from the one that had been elected in 1949. The brief experiment in open politics was over."
 AFG_REP.1.d:0 "The Hizb-i Sirri Ittihad, led by Ismael Balkhi today, with the approval of the Loya jirga have written a new constitution, declaring the Republic of Afghanistan. The party and their paramilitary as well as fervent supporters seized power and established a republican government. Dedicated supporters of the previous government have been imprisoned or executed, policies are currently being submitted through parliament for debate regarding the equal treatment of all ethnic groups and religions within the country. Long live the Republic of Afghanistan!"

 USA_AFG.1.d:0 "Today, we were greeted by a US Air Force flight at our airport today, with none other than the President [USA.GetLeader], of the United States of America. He met with our King Mohammed Zahir Shah at the Tajbeg Palace. While the visit was an informal one, many things were discussed, including continued American diplomatic ties with the nation. May Allah bless our brothers in the west!"
 AFG_SOV.1.d:0 "Today we received a letter from Andrey Vyshinsky, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union. It states the Soviet's strong opposition to the UN mission in our nation, that it is the work of U.S. imperialists, that the whole thing is a ruse and the Americans are planning the construction of military roads and airfields near the border. It was sent to us shortly after a bill to nationalize the oil in the region by our seventh National Assembly and our invitation of a UN technical assistance mission to the country. They visited the Shibarghan area in the northwest, albeit very close to the border with the Soviets, there are rich oil deposits that have been discovered there. We will refute this note, don't they understand our economic success is dependent on motor transport, and all of the oil in our country is of strategic interest?"
 AFG_SOV.2.d:0 "Despite our beautifully written letter, the government of Afghanistan have seemingly rejected the letter Andrey Vyshinsky delivered regarding the imperialist United States and the United Nations in their involvement in the economy of Afghanistan. Perhaps we're trying the wrong approach, instead of strong-arming the Afghan government, how about we indulge them with money and weaponry? Perhaps this will bring them to our side. We will consider a shipment of weapons in the following year or so. But as for now, we will keep vigilant watch on our southern frontier."

 Afghanistan.10.d:0 "Today, the arrest of Mohammad Arif was conducted as well as of devout supporters, after a short trial he was found guilty of planning to stage a military takeover of the nation. Intelligence reports show that he had a large following within the National Assembly who would be willing to bend to his rule and would do anything he said, thankfully we uncovered this plot before anything could come from it, hopefully this keeps us stable and will dissuade any other officers from planning something of this caliber, let this be a fine example of what we do to traitors!"
 Afghanistan.3.d:0 "Today, we have decided to release Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pashtun independence activist, famed for his work in ending the rule of the British Raj in India, it's simply too much trouble to keep him interned in our nation, a lifelong pacifist and Muslim, he frequently demanded the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state named Pashtunistan, composing of all Pashtun territories of British India. With his new found freedom perhaps he can work in our favor to get Pashtuns currently living in Pakistan to fight on our side."

 Afghanistan.4.d:0 "Today, the King of our nation, his Majesty Mohammed Zahir Shah has delivered a powerful speech regarding the Pashtunistan issue, he demanded that Pashtunistan be reintegrated into Afghanistan, they are rightfully our people, and deserve to be governed by us and represented by us, not by the Pakistani government. Our king has a deep emotional commitment to it because his great-grandfather, Sardar Sultan Muhammad Khan, the brother of Emir Dost Muhammad Khan, had been the last Afghan ruler of Peshawar, when the Sikhs pushed him out in 1834 under Ranjit Singh. The unification of Pashtunistan with Afghanistan is of the utmost importance, that he will not rest, not until the day the Pashtuns are reunited with their homeland."

 AFG_IND.1.d:0 "Today we received a letter from the Afghan ambassador, marked highly confidential. It states that, while Pakistan focuses the majority of its troops in the west, that we should perform a surprise attack along the entire Pakistani border, to pressure them into peace negotiations, and once they have surrendered, in the ensuing peace deal we will receive all of Kashmir. Perhaps this can bring an end to our ongoing problem regarding the ownership of Kashmir."
 AFG_IND.2.d:0 "Despite the ambitiousness of our letter, we are surprised to hear that the Indian government accepted our proposal, that they should attack Pakistan to seize the Kashmir region while they are occupied fighting us, to bring about a sooner end to this war. Perhaps now we can reverse the mistake of the Durand Line and the division of the British Raj. We always knew we had friends in high places in the Indian government to help us win our war."

 AFG_IND.3.d:0 "Despite our strategic offer to the Indian government, that they should attack Pakistan and seize the hotly fought over Kashmir region. We are surprised to learn that our offer has been denied, who knew the Indian government was so inept at taking advantage of a good opportunity?"

 AFG_PAK.20.d:0 "Reports come back from an army field headquarters near the Pakistani border that we have conducted a successful raid against a military outpost in Pakistan, multiple Pakistani soldiers have been killed, and we have stolen any useful supplies. We doubt there will be any retaliation for this, we've made sure to leave no mark of our presence. A job well done by our boys on the ground, that's for sure!"

 AFG_PAK.21.d:0 "Reports have been flooding in from one of our army forward operating bases near the Pakistani border that an excursion we conducted inside of Pakistan to disrupt military operations has failed, some men were killed and numerous are missing-in-action. This is an operational failure, and perhaps we should rethink our strategy going forward against the Pakistanis."
 AFG_PAK.22.d:0 "We have received an after action report from one of our most skilled commanders on the field on the Afghan border currently, it states that we have successfully staged a raid against the Afghan border, they failed to repulse our attack. During an attempt at building a border fence, we killed three soldiers and injured numerous others and demolished parts of a fence, well done!"
 AFG_PAK.23.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, and strategic planning, our border raid against an Afghan military outpost inside their country has failed, a majority of our soldiers were killed, or successfully retreated. Apparently word around the company that performed the attack is that they were expecting it, and had landmines and machine gun emplacements at the ready. Perhaps we should anticipate this kind of thing next time and hit back harder, let's show those Afghans who is the boss around here!"

 Afghani_Coup.3.d:0 "Word has come from the Kingdom of Afghanistan, that they are no longer a kingdom. The previous Prime Minister Shah Mahmud Khan was executed today in downtown Kabul, his corpse was dumped in the streets. Afghanistan's reigning monarch Mohammed Zahir Shah and the rest of the house of Barakzai's status are unknown at this time, ending over 200 years of royal rule in Afghanistan. The political party, the Hizb-i Sirri Ittihad, was responsible for the overthrow is led by a man named Ismael Balkhi, the motivations for the seizure of power are unknown as of right now, but one can assume that they are not happy with the authoritarian ways in the previous administration. All eyes are on the new government, and what actions they will undertake to improve the conditions of the people."
 Afghani_Coup.4.d:0 "Ismael Balkhi, a poet and well known political leader in Afghanistan, has been arrested alongside five other men who attempted a coup d'état on king Mohammed Zahir Shah, as well as assassinating the Prime Minister. The government of Afghanistan had successfully intercepted communications regarding it and cracked down before it could take place. All members that have been arrested are charged with conspiring to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. They were planning on executing it during the Nowruz celebration, to try and take the government by surprise during the festivities."
 CENTO.225.d:0 "After recent negotiations and détente with Pakistan. News from the Baghdad Pact's press organization came out today that the newly formed Republic of Afghanistan have joined the alliance. The Baghdad Pact is a military alliance modeled after NATO, which the nations apart of the alliance are committed to mutual cooperation and protection. The goal of the organization is to contain the Soviet Union by having a line of strong states along the USSR's southern frontier."
 AFG_IND.4.d:0 "Today, an announcement from the Indian government was made, the declaration of war against Pakistan. The reasoning, that they are bringing stability to the region of Kashmir, as they are uncertain of what could happen to the Hindus in the region following a potential defeat in the current Afghan-Pakistani war, it being dubbed \"a simple protective measure of our ethnic people.'' by the Indian government.     Perhaps this could bring an end to the region that has plagued with border skirmishes and conflict?"
 AFGPAKWAR.1.d:0 "After tensions boiled to an absolute high, Afghanistan today has announced it's invasion of the Pakistan, stating that it's invasion is to prevent further conflict in the region, with the casus belli of liberating the rightful land the Pashtuns lived on. Reports come in from Chaman, a city near the border that Afghan soldiers have steamed through with no regard for the civilian populace. Some nations in the region boycotting the invasion, with even talk of sanctions on Afghanistan. Whether any other nations get involved is left unknown. The future is uncertain for this part of the world."
 Afghanistan.6.d:0 "Today in Kabul, the Afghan Government convened a hand-picked tribal council. It included the members of the National Assembly. The Afghan parliament made a proclamation against Pakistan, and in favor of the Pashtuns' right of self-determination. In disregard to the established global norms and international laws, it passed a resolution, rejecting, unilaterally, all treaties, conventions, and agreements concluded between the Afghan government and the British India government. The council passed a resolution in support of Pashtunistan and declared the 1893 Durand Agreement, the Anglo-Afghan Pact of 1905, the Independence Treaty of Rawalpindi of 1919, the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 and other treaties and agreements in regard to international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan (based on Durand Line) and in regard to the status of the Pashtuns as null and void, having no legal implication. In addition, to reaffirm this abrogation, Pashtunistan Day was declared to be officially celebrated every year on August 31."
 AFG_SHIA.5.d:0 "With the establishment of the new Republic of Afghanistan, led by Ismael Balkhi, the monarchy has nowhere to stay. With riots across the nation from supporters of the new government have been forced to leave. The royal palace has been vandalized and the monarchy has fled the nation. As to where they went is unknown at this time, but rumors say they allegedly fled to nearby Iraq or Jordan. There is no solid evidence and the new government does not seem to care. Now the monarchy is gone, we can end discrimination against the Hazaras and Tajik and to stop the favoritism regarding the Pashtuns, to bring about true equality to Afghanistan."
