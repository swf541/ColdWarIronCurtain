However, thanks to Ethnic Mongolian guerrilla units created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s, as well as the joint Mongolian-Soviet Invasion of Manchuria, the Japanese puppet regime was disbanded in 1945. Shortly after, representatives met in Xilinhot and proclaimed the establishment of an Inner Mongolian Republic. The Communist Party of China fearing separatism, sent Ulanhu to the region to disband the government and the eventual integration into the Peoples Republic of China. After the crushing defeat of the CPC, Ulanhu declared another provisional government in order to stabilise the situation, waiting for further developments before deciding whether to join the Mongolian People's Republic or the remnants of the Communist Party of China.§!"

###Events###

MEN.0.t:0 "The Inner Mongolian Succession"
MEN.0.d:0 "Following the arrival of Soviet troops in Manchuria once more, the former Autonomous Mongolian region has declared its Independence from China as well as the Communist Party of China and has established a provisional government under Ulanhu. He claimed that his government will provisionally administer the Inner Mongolian regions that are not under Kuomintang control and eventually reunite with our government. Whether this is true is uncertain, however, we can unfortunately do little to nothing about this development without risking the wrath of the Soviet Union."
MEN.0.a:0 "We'll deal with them later."
MEN.0.b:0 "Mongolia shall not fall to the Chinese! (Play as Inner Mongolia)"

MEN.1.t:0 "The Inner Mongolian Land Reform Campaign"
MEN.1.d:0 "As part of our goals and policies, we will introduce massive land reform campaigns, seizing agrarian land from the remaining middle and upper classes and re-distributing it to the local peasants. We shall become organizers of the well-being of the masses, and they will truly rally around us and give us their warm support. The former owners of the confiscated lands shall not be entitled to receive any compensation for exploiting the working class for decades."
MEN.1.a:0 "Excellent."

MEN.2.t:0 "The Inner Mongolian Republic demands the Extraction of Prince Demchugdongrob"
MEN.2.d:0 "Following the Mongol-Soviet Invasion of Manchuria, the Japanese puppet regimes of Manchukuo and Mengjiang were disbanded. While Emperor Puyi failed to escape from China, former collaborator Prince Demchugdongrob has fled the country and was orginially welcomed by us and offered asylum. Due to rising pressure from the newly founded Inner Mongolian Republic as well as pressure from the Soviet Union, our government is deciding whether to send him to Xilinhot or to keep him in Mongolia. Refusing this request could heavily damage our relations with the Inner Mongolian Republic and possibly delay any reunification efforts that were made previously."
MEN.2.a:0 "The Prince will stay."
MEN.2.b:0 "Send him to Xilinhot."

MEN.3.t:0 "Ulaanbaatar gives in"
MEN.3.d:0 "The Outer Mongolian government has accepted our request and have reported to us that Prince Demchugdongrob is already being escorted to Xilinhot and should arrive in a matter of days." 
MEN.3.a:0 "Appreciated."

MEN.4.t:0 "Ulaanbaatar refuses"
MEN.4.d:0 "The Outer Mongolian government has refused to send Prince Demchugdongrob back to Inner Mongolia. Those traitors rather keep an Imperialist Japanese collaborator safe rather than handing him over to us."
MEN.4.a:0 "We won't forget that."

MEN.5.t:0 "The Future of the Second Mongolian Republic"
MEN.5.d:0 "After the retreat of the People's Liberation Army to Manchuria and the downfall of Mao Zedong within the Communist Party, Ulanhu has formed a provisional Inner Mongolian government that will administer the Inner Mongolian Region until the geo-political situation has become clearer. With the establishment of the People's Government of Northern China under the Pro-Soviet Wang Ming Administration, the time has come for the provisional government to choose which path Inner Mongolia should pursue. Certain members believe the region should reunite with the Chinese and thus join Wang Mings government while the Mongolian representatives argue that reunification with the Mongolian People's Reaction would be the best option. Other voices argue that we should maintain our independence and serve as a buffer state between the Chinese and the Mongolians, in order to appease the Soviet Union and secure their support."
MEN.5.a:0 "Allign with the Communist Party of China."
MEN.5.b:0 "We need to maintain our Independence!"
MEN.5.c:0 "Reunification with Mongolia is the only option."

MEN.6.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]The Second Inner Mongolian Republic"
MEN.6.d:0 "Following the crushing defeat of the People's Liberation Army against the Kuomintang forces in China, the former Mongolian Autonomous Region of the short-lived People's Republic of China has declared it's provisional Independence. Today in Xilinhot, the Politbureau of the Inner Mongolian Communist Party has decided to maintain its own state for the time being, alligning closer to the Soviet Union instead of Mongolia and the People's Government of Northern China. The Mongolian government has not shown any kind of protest to this declaration, claiming that those regions have been under Han Dominance for quite some time. The Communist Party of China however has condemned this action, accusing the government in Xilinhot to further divide the Asian Proletarian movement. The Soviet Union has not given an official statement yet, but experts assume that it lies in Moscows interest to have another buffer state between Northern China and Mongolia. The Kuomintang government has denounced this declaration as invalid on the basis of their One-China Policy and announced to expand reinforcements at the Sino-Mongolian borders."
MEN.6.a:0 "Will this divide China even further?"

MEN.7.t:0 "Inner Mongolia wants to join our Government"
MEN.7.d:0 "Following fierce discussion in Xilinhot, the Communist Party of Inner Mongolia under the leadership of Ulanhu has decided that Inner Mongolia should once again join our government and be integrated into the People's Government of Northern China as an autonomous province. Chairman Wang Ming has appreciated this decision and has announced that the Chinese People of the North are open to make the transition as smooth as possible and respect the cultural and domestic demands and needs of the Inner Mongolian people."
MEN.7.a:0 "Magnificent."

MEN.8.t:0 "Inner Mongolia wants to join our Government"
MEN.8.d:0 "Following fierce discussion in Xilinhot, the Communist Party of Inner Mongolia under the leadership of Ulanhu has decided that Inner Mongolia should reunite with our government and be integrated into the Mongolian People's Republic. Chairman Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal has appreciated this decision and has announced that the Outer Mongolian People of the North are open to make the transition as smooth as possible and respect the cultural and domestic demands and needs of the Inner Mongolian people."
MEN.8.a:0 "Magnificent."

MEN.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader] The Reunification of Mongolia."
MEN.9.d:0 "Ever since the fall of the Qing dynasty and the Russian Civil War, the regions of Mongolia have been divided, with the outer regions being part of the Soviet sphere and the inner parts switchting ownership between China and Japanese in the last decades. Today, the provisional Inner Mongolian government, that was formed in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War and the victory of the Kuomintang, has announced that it will join the Mongolian People's Republic. The outer Mongolian government has shown great appreciation for this move and is aiding Xilinhot to prepare for a smooth integration, while the Communist Party of China has critisized this move, claiming that this will endanger the welfare of millions of Han Chinese living in Inner Mongolia. Experts also assume that the Han-Mongol divide will prove as a great challenge for the new All-Mongolian government and think that social tensions and unrest will rise quickly."
MEN.9.a:0 "A Surprising Development."
