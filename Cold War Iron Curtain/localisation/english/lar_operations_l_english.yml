 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_BOP_3:0 "It is time to report back to headquarters at Langley to update the bosses on our pilot recruitment program."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_BOP_4:0 "With the large number of airfields scattered around the United States, there surely must be some that have some old aircraft that can be salvaged for our uses."

#Cuban Exiles Land in Bay of Pigs! (News)
#Today, the world was shocked to wake up to reports that a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, known as Brigade 2506, have landed in the Bay of Pigs off the southwestern coast of Cuba. A force of about 1,400 men, armed with American equipment as well as B-26 bombers, are engaging with Cuban military and security services, who were quickly alerted to their presence. The United States has denied any responsibility in the invasion, according to a statement by the US Ambassador to the United Nations. The Soviets, predictably, have decried the invasion as a “CIA plot using paid criminals”, much to the chagrin of the United States. 
#Cuban Exiles Land at Trinidad! (News)
#Today, the world was shocked to wake up to reports that a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, known as Brigade 2506, have landed in Trinidad, Cuba, approximately 170 miles southwest of the capital, Havana. A force of about 1,400 men, armed with American equipment as well as B-26 bombers, have faced little resistance from Cuban military and security services and are presently contacting local insurgent groups to aid their fight. The United States has denied any involvement in the invasion, according to a statement by the US Ambassador to the United Nations. The Soviets, predictably, have decried the invasion as a “CIA plot using paid criminals”, much to the chagrin of the United States.
#Cuban Exile Invasion a Success!
#The landings of Cuban exile forces only days ago has ended in the complete overthrow of the Castro government in Havana! With the assistance of local insurgents, air support, and US naval presence, the exiles have formed a provisional government, as they round up communist sympathizers and imprison them. The United States has expressed great approval at these developments, declaring that “communism has been vanquished in Cuba” and promising aid for the exiles, who will predictably join the US's sphere of influence. While there are no comments from the Soviets yet, it is clear that they are not pleased with these developments.
#Cuban Exile Invasion a Failure!
#Unfortunately, reports from media outlets in Cuba's capital, Havana, have indicated that a local rebellion of anti-Castro insurgent exiles has been crushed by Cuban military and security forces. From the start, the landing of said exiles (known as Brigade 2506) was a disaster, with Cuban forces being easily tipped off to their landing location, and their support ships being forced to run aground without offloading their supplies. With hundreds killed and the rest captured and marked for execution, the outcome does not look good for the anti-communist movement in Cuba. 
#Should the US Intervene in Cuba?
#With the failure of Brigade 2506 to successfully overthrow the Cuban government immediately, we have to ponder our options. They continue to fight on, but only for a few more days. Our generals have drawn up plans for US intervention in Cuba, including the use of our Atlantic Fleet as well as the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and armored units to quickly subdue the Cuban military and security forces. Some have expressed opposition to this plan, considering that the Soviet Union could respond offensively in kind. However, we must act quickly, and a decision must be made.
#US Intervenes in Cuba (News)
#Shocking news came out of Cuba today as approximately four US Army and Marine divisions landed in Cuba, only days after the ill-fated landing by Cuban exile Brigade 2506. Elements of the 101st Airborne and 82nd Airborne Divisions have landed at Jose Marti and San Antonio de los Banos Airfields, as well as Mariel and Baracoa Airfields surrounding Havana. The 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions, meanwhile, have landed at Tarara, approximately 10 miles from Havana's city center, as the US enforces a naval blockade and air superiority of the island. It is clear that Castro's government will not stand much of a chance unless the Soviets intervene.
#US Does Not Intervene in Cuba (News)
#In an official statement today, the President announced that while the United States nominally supports Brigade 2506's mission, the US will not intervene militarily to overthrow Castro despite the military options provided. Pundits speculate a fear of Soviet aggression as being one of the principal factors, although they assume that US intelligence services will continue to harass Cuba in the coming months.
