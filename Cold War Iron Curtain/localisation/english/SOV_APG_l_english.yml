 soviet_leader_change.5.desc:0 "\nOn June 18, a regular meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee was organized under the pretext of Khrushchev's removal from the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU.\n\nThe "anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Shepilov, who joined them" a group of the most prominent figures of the Stalin era, attempted to remove Khrushchev by recruiting a majority to the Presidium of the majority, which they succeeded in doing.\n\nBut did the agreement between Zhukov and Serov come true, and the "Anti-Party Group" was suspended and denigrated?"
 soviet_leader_change.5.o.A:0 "Khrushchev won, the meeting of the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU"

 soviet_leader_change.8.t:0 "Appointment of Vyacheslav Molotov as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU"
 soviet_leader_change.8.d:0 "\nVyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, a man who had seen absolutely everything and almost fell into disgrace with his own patrons, saw a lot everywhere, but here he did not know how to act here.\nAlready almost resigned to the fact that he would simply return to the Foreign Ministry, since he had every chance after the triumph of the Group, he was surprised and stunned by the fact that he would become the "first person of the state" because he did not even aim for these positions with the Bulganin government, nicknamed the "regime of the democratic Cheka" due to the too diverse nature of the actions taken by the government, because collective leadership with a central figure and the absence of any regulatory bodies is impossible or close to impossible.\nBut, the decision was made. The appointment to the "highest" position was scheduled for today, and all members of the presidium, on the recommendation of the already former head of state Bulganin, elected Comrade Molotov. The echoes of the crisis 57 and 53 made themselves felt, but there were no other options, as well as alternatives to Molotov\nWith the official appointment of Molotov, the official era of the Group's rule began, because the country is waiting for changes and rearrangements in all spheres of life. Everywhere, and always. So yes, ordinary members of the presidium, who are not particularly responsible for anything, will build a new country.\n\n"Hail, our free Fatherland\nFriendship of peoples is a reliable stronghold!\nLenin's Party is a national force\nIt leads us to the triumph of communism!"\n-the anthem of the USSR, version 1977-1991"

 SOV_Molotov.1.t:0 "Final of Central Committee Clean"
 SOV_Molotov.1.desc:0 "\nFor the most part, a historical mistake, after the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Khrushchev won the struggle for power. Insane reforms, unnecessary "liberalization", condemnation of the so-called "cult of Stalin's personality", which led to a split in the socialist camp and its associates. But, thanks to a successful combination of events in 57, this error was corrected. Yes, Bulganin's rule was short-lived, but it marked a new era and a return to adequate values in the country, at least observance of the precepts of Marx-Lenin and the withdrawal of the "privatization" of positions in the state by the Khrushchevites. Molotov must understand that Khrushchev has done a lot in 4 years, and it will take a lot of work to turn it all around."

 SOV_Molotov.4.desc:0 "\nMikhail Andreevich Suslov is a vivid political, and primarily an ideological toy of Khrushchev, in fact, a mouthpiece for promoting revisionist nonsense and a policy of betrayal. Panteleimon Kondratievich Ponomarenko is essentially a nationalist with delusional ideas and megalomania, in particular his desire to transfer Kaliningrad and attempts to become almost secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

Yes, he does not have an "ideal" reputation - at that meeting of the Presidium he initially chose the side of the traitor Khrushchev, but after reflecting on the situation and thinking everything over, he took the side of common sense. Although Shepilov's role in the success of the group was not so great, his mainly reformist views would help the country to further develop and prosper."

 #Bulganin events
 
 Bulg_resignflavors.1.t:0 "Philosophy of the late evening"
 Bulg_resignflavors.1.desc:0 "\nIt was getting evening. A little over a year had passed since the June meeting of the Presidium, and Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin was once again at his dacha on the Shchelkovsky Highway in the Moscow region.\nHe was sorting through another stack of bureaucratic papers that had fallen on him "by duty", repeating each other time and again.\nBulganin recalled his life. Who he was, how he had achieved "such heights". How, as a small transport worker at the VChK, he reached the rank of "Leader of the Peoples", in fact - the level of Comrade Stalin, under whom Nikolai Alexandrovich and built all the state career.\nMarch 1953. The mysterious death of Joseph Vissarionovich. "The case of the doctors," and oh the horror! The victory of that bald, ugly third-grader who wanted to plant corn all over the country!\n"The Company for the Development of the Virgin Lands", "The Cult of Personality" - how it all threw dust in the eyes, and seemed sweet and tantalizing. But after such a short time everything fell into place.  And here it was, the chance.\nJune '57 was the highlight. The questions were from everyone to everyone. And luck played its hand: Khrushchev, though he stretched all the sessions, but as it turned out later, Zhukov failed. True, honor and conscience triumphed \nBut it's all gone now. Sleepless nights were not what he was fighting for. The same days already pissed him off, but he could not change exactly anything, otherwise it would look nothing, both for the country and for his comrades. The final decision remained, though. The final one. And he had made it. Once, and for all"
 Bulg_resignflavors.1.a:0 "It was all leading up to this."
 
 Bulg_resignflavors.2.t:0 "The opinion of those whose society we are building"
 Bulg_resignflavors.2.desc:0 "\nCommunism, communism, communism....\n\nA word that is the main thing for every honest person who wants prosperity for the Union. There are fewer of them, and we almost started the destruction of such a rare human species ourselves. On the other side, these people would be called "patriots" who want the spread of insane capitalism and the destruction of our idea - although we are malicious militarists, but they want extermination for us.\nIn any case, we are far from overseas nonsense. The June events were expressed in literally 3 paragraphs in the largest newspapers in different republics. The legendary "Swan Lake" - the ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - was broadcast throughout the union for four days, because events developed so quickly that "The anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Shepilov who joined them" - the stigma that the Khrushchev gang tried to push through the press, where the main battles were, from which everything and It depended. Yes, if Khrushchevists had settled in the conditional Pravda or Izvestia - but the regime had switched to the "group" - it would not have ended well.\nAnd to be honest, the result of the government reshuffle was perceived in different ways. Someone breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that for the most part everything would return to the "Stalinist" rails of life, supporting the new government to the best of their ability. On the contrary, someone advocated the most terrible options - the entry of troops into Moscow and the bloody removal of traitors who dared to shake the gorgeous and indomitable leader Khrushchev. And no - they were not the bosses of anything anywhere. For as an ordinary Russian-speaking citizen would say, no one knew where to run. Simply put, "what is the line of the party and which way will the state go"?\nWell, someone created a new term for all this - Stalinist Soviet democracy. Why? - Khrushchev combined the positions of Secretary General and chairman of the Council of Ministers - which led to the complete usurpation of power by the "cornhusker and his gang."\nAnd in general, this is a new milestone for the country and the socialist camp as a whole. For this is a new policy everywhere, in particular internal and external - we need tremendous work to connect the left movements that Khrushchev's ham split with the desire to correct.\n- Bulganin came to the conclusion that he did not waste his time and energy in vain"
 Bulg_resignflavors.2.a:0 "- In general, I am not destined to see the final results, no matter how much I would like to"
 
 Bulg_resignflavors.3.t:0 "Wandering among the clouds"
 Bulg_resignflavors.3.desc:0 "\nNikolai Alexandrovich fell asleep unnoticed, reading papers on the development of industry in the Yakut ASSR. The faint light from an already old lamp, a soft chair, all this was insanely lulling.\nBut one of the guards had other plans. Hearing a loud bang from a glass that fell from the table, which miraculously did not break, he rushed into the room with frantic screams, preparing to fight. He woke Bulganin, who jumped up in his chair and almost fell off it. But Nikolai Alexandrovich had already gotten used to it in a year - an unspoken state of emergency was established in the country, because there was a threat from all sides, so that at any threat to the life of the head of the country, be ready to protect him.\nWhen everything fell into place, Bulganin asked to send him an envelope marked "special for him" to the Central Committee. There is no way back, but he would never want to return to the position he is in now.\nBulganin resigned of his own accord. Yes, neither the Central Committee nor the party could "swallow" the departure of the main figure of the state, and this letter was not for collective consideration at a conditional plenum or presidium. The letter went to the person who, in his opinion, would be an ideal replacement for him, and the same ideal compromise between all factions, so that the entire state apparatus would not bite its own throat in its death throes as a result of the struggle for power.\nThe letter went to Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, who spent most of his career working, as they would say now, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR. An odious and great figure, "finished off" by His Majesty Khrushchev with one will, and who managed, together with other prominent persons, to defeat the Gorgon Medusa in time.\nAnd Bulganin was sure of one thing. Molotov will not refuse. Not so much because of their own benefit, but because of the need not to fall into the dirt in the first place in front of themselves, but because of the need to unite the state and the bureaucratic apparatus.\nThere was a week left. Exactly one week. And Nikolai Alexandrovich will enter a new era. Once and for all"
 Bulg_resignflavors.3.a:0 "We all live on the same big road, it's just that it's different sizes"
 
 Bulg.9.t:0 "Human, seemingly ordinary oddities"
 Bulg.9.desc:0 "\nNikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, over the past year he has fallen in love with two things - peace and certainty. The first one was missing as an axiom - no one understood what was going on "and what to grab", because this life did not promise anything good, but only oddities and madness. Bulganin was needed everywhere and always - the country tore him apart for the sake of its need, and he could not refuse.\nAnd he lacked certainty due to a lack of understanding of the situation in the country. Because he received letters from all over the country with very different assessments of situations, and sometimes with opinions, often not even very much...censored, because he was no different from the others. And the most important thing is that he never saw his official position, although he is "all-powerful".\nAnd on such another difficult day, he decided not to lie to anyone and, at least for a little while, be alone with himself and calm down cornyly. Yes, he took a huge amount of papers - he couldn't get rid of it, no matter how much he wanted to.\nTaking a stock of food, a small guard, he went to his achievement, which he received "on duty" as either a reward or a gift. And in general, it was no longer important, because it played a completely different role."
