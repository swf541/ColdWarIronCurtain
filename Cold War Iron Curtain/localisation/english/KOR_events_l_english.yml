 #Samoan Porposal Events
 Samoan_Proposal.1.d:0 "The Pentagon recently presented a new proposal to deal with the Korean refugee crisis. Jeju is very vulnerable to communist aggression, any attempt to strengthen a government in exile could result in renewed conflict with us at the disadvantage. The Pentagon wishes to turn Samoa into the main base for a democratic Korean government in exile. Korean refugees can also be resettled there. Samoa offers a safe base, in the Pacific, from which a future liberation campaign can be waged."
 Samoan_Proposal.2.d:0 "The United States wishes to relocate our government in exile and refugees to Samoa. They promise us extensive autonomy. Samoa is in the Pacific and safety away from communist forces. Our military and political experts note we can rebuild our forces and built our legitimacy without the fear of communist interference. The reality of our circumstances mean even if we do not like the proposal, it's smart to agree to that proposal..."
 Samoan_Proposal.4.d:0 "The situation in Jeju Island is more terrible than we expected. The Korean government has failed to control Jeju residents, and it seems that it cannot hold on anymore. If we had intervened a little bit, we could have provided them with support and supplies and maybe given the island to Japan or we could have occupied it ourselves. However, it is already late. Now control of the island is effectively taken by North Korea. We can't choose anything. We just have to decide. And we are in a hurry."
 Samoan_Proposal.9.d:0 "The United States Navy confirmed thousands of Korean refugees fleeing communist occupation are currently being transported to Samoa. This is the first wave as the American government plans to move as many refugees as possible. Senior surviving South Korean civil and military leaders are already in Samoa. They are establishing a government of exile and an administrative structure to oversee the arriving refugees. Their is concern among Koreans and other American allies that the new government in Samoa may be too far away or isolated to effect change in Korea. However, the United States insists a base in Samoa offers the best access while maintaining the security of the democratic Korea forces."
 Samoan_Proposal.10.d:0 "The Republic of Korea opened its first session of a new National Assembly in Samoa. Inaugurating the beginning of its new government in exile following the communist takeover of South Korea. The session saw leading military and civil leaders promise to help settle refugees in Samoa and begin preparing for a campaign of national liberation. Much thanks was given to the United States for facilitating the establishment of a capital in Samoa. Although American allies were quick to congratulate the Korean government, the news is being widely mocked in socialist states. The communist Korean government condemned the Samoa regime as American puppets with no comprehension of reality."

The South Korean government has declared state of emergency and is reaching out to the United States of America and the United Nations for assistance.

However, we could wait and see if we can make a breakthrough in the war and see if we can unite the Korean Peninsula, but if it has been going on for this long it may take another few months to a couple of years.

 FRAkorea.4.d:0 "In an effort to support the democratically-elected South Korean regime and support her American allies, the French government has sent a battalion sized volunteer force to aid South Korea against the Soviet and Chinese backed North Korea. According to various sources, it will be comprised of more than 3500 troops, with both volunteer and reserve forces. It will be led by Lieutenant General Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, one of France's most decorated war heroes during WW2. With the addition of France in this small scale conflict in East Asia, observers point out that it could lead to an escalation of Cold War tensions, and can bring NATO and the Soviet Union into direct military conflict."
 korea.47.d:0 "Amidst a global climate of discontent towards authority and a national distaste toward the South Korean government, the embers of protest flared there this year. For the past two years, the people of South Korea have been growing ever more resentful of their president, Syngman Rhee, in office since 1948. In 1958, fearing a loss of power, President Rhee forced a shift in the nation's laws that expanded executive power extensively. The following year, Rhee's two largest political rivals for the 1960 presidential election died under suspicious circumstances and one of his closest political allies was elected vice president by fraudulent vote, leading to widespread rumors of Rhee maintaining power by blood and intrigue. This year Koreans announced they'd had enough. What began as a small protest by the Democratic Party exploded in scale after the police killed a student protestor, with a tear gas shell. As protests swelled throughout April, outnumbered soldiers and police fought a losing battle before finally refusing to fire on the marchers. Left at the mercy of his electorate, Rhee was quick to step down and flee the country. The people of South Korea now look to reorganize their republic on a parliamentary model, hoping to curb the power of the executive and ensure that no more corrupt strongmen seize the reins of power."
 korea.48.d:0 "The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to pass resolution 82 in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Soviet Union did not attend the meeting as they are boycotting the Security Council so could not veto. Of the present security council members, only Yugoslavia chose to abstain. The resolution condemns the North Korean invasion and call on member states to assist South Korea and refrain from arming or supporting North Korea. The United State and its allies are heralding the resolution as a major diplomatic victory and analysts believe it will pave the way for more direct American involvement in the conflict. For many member states, especially the United States and Western Europe, there is sympathy to the South Koreans as the memories of World War II and the surprise attacks by the Axis powers remain embedded in the collective memory of its leaders."
 
 #Secretary of Defense question event
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.1.d:0 "The former Secretary of Defense Lee Beom-seok has requested that his resignation be accepted. His role as Prime Minister will remain, but if he resigns as Secretary of Defense, a new figure will have to sit there and take charge of the military. What should we do?"
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.2.d:0 "Shin Sung-mo became the new defense minister. He was a former naval officer and served in the military with the rank of lieutenant general, but recently returned to Korea to assist Rhee Syng-man. He has no actual experience and is considered "military incompetent" by many people, but it may be quite helpful for President Syngman Rhee himself. As soon as he was appointed as Minister of Defense, he is strongly advocating the theory of Korean unification by force."
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.3.d:0 "Admiral Shin Sung-mo demanded the highest rank of navy in exchange for taking the position of defense minister from him. What should we do?"

 KOR_diplo50s.1.d:0 "After the United States of America arranged conversations between South Korean and Japanese politicians, the official Japanese-Korean diplomatic conference is scheduled to be held between the two parties.

 #Kim Koo assassination
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.0.d:0 "We gotta prepare for the upcoming event. How it'll work?"
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.1.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea have ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was assassinated today. According to police, Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and shot him 4 times. According to Ahn, he claims that he has sole responsibility for the assassination, claiming it was done of his own fruition, and that no other party played a role in Kim Koo's assassination. He also stated that Kim Koo is allegedly a collaborator with the Soviet Union, and that his presence in South Korea serves as a breeding ground for rebellion and insurgency. However, observers believe otherwise, and they speculate that the assassination attempt was actually orchestrated by the Rhee administration itself in an effort to consolidate power and influence throughout the Republic. Nevertheless, this assassination will be a stain on the Rhee administration's reputation."
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.2.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea almost ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was so close to assassinated today. Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and almost shot him, but right before that, Kim Koo was jumped to him and screamed for help. At that moment, the guards in the residents were quickly running into the house and subdued the suspect. Later this morning, Kim Koo made the statement that the killer that sent to his house was a 'clearly one of president Syngman Rhee's people'. The Kim Koo had no injury, and this assassination attempt will be a dark stain on the Rhee administration's reputation."
 KOR_kimseongsu.2.d:0 "Many citizens were stricken by grief in South Korea as Kim Seong-su, a renowned Korean newspaper owner and a senior politician, passed away of illness in Seoul. During the Japanese occupation period, Kim Seong-su had run various organizations ranging from a press company to textile companies and schools, and contributed to the cultural modernization of Korea. Like many other Korean newspaper owners of his time, Kim Seong-su supported Japanese war effort in several articles. After the liberation of Korea, Kim Seong-su openly reflected on his past activities and became the second vice president of the Republic of Korea. However, he resigned in protest against President Syngman Rhee’s dictatorial behaviors. He has continued advocating democracy until his recent death."
 KOR_yisiyeong.2.d:0 "Many citizens were stricken by grief in South Korea as Yi Si-yeong, a renowned Korean independence activist and a senior politician, passed away of natural causes in Busan. Yi Si-yeong and his family members had devoted their whole life to the Korean independence movement, spending much of their wealth for independence movements both domestic and abroad. After Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Yi Si-yeong was elected the first vice president of the Republic of Korea thanks to his high reputation. His funeral is going to be held near Busan."
 #Syngman Rhee 1948
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.1.d:0 "The official activity of the Special Investigation Committee on Act of Betrayal has been unexpectedly suspended due to a raid on its office building. The culprit behind this raid turned out to be the police force of the Syngman Rhee administration. Syngman Rhee has long been critical of the committee’s investigation on ex-Japanese collaborators in the political, economic, and cultural fields of South Korea, especially the police force. Following the dissolvement of the committee, Syngman Rhee’s administration arrested opponent legislators on charges of being a spy of the Worker’s Party of South Korea. The arrested legislators, including the Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, had played a major role in organizing the committee."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.2.d:0 "In this aternoon, the Bodo league was established. The establishment of this organization was modeled after Daehwasuk, a pro-Japanese conversion group during Japanese colonial era, and is related to the National Security Act, which took effect in December 1948, and it is analyzed that the Korean government needed an institution to systematically protect, manage, and monitor converts. Prosecutor Sunwoo Jong-won and Oh Je-do led the formation process."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.3.d:0 "In this morning, the eradication campaign in Jeju just ended. The First Republic of Korea under President Syngman Rhee escalated the suppression of the uprising from August 1948, declaring martial law in November and beginning an "eradication campaign" against rebel forces in the rural areas of Jeju in March 1949, defeating them within two months. The situation in Jeju doesn't seem good."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.4.d:0 "After independence on August 15, 1945, there were several left-wing parties in South Korea, but the activities of the Korean Communist Party were almost at a standstill, so the three parties (the Communist Party of Korea, the People's Party of Korea, and the New Democratic Party of South Korea) were merged to form the 'Worker's Party of South Korea.' Heo Heon was elected as the first chairman and vice chairman Park Hon-yong was elected. This week, President Syng-man Rhee of the First Republic enacted the National Security Law, ousting all communist forces in the Republic of Korea using public power under the National Security Law."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.5.d:0 "The day after martial law was declared in Busan, 50 legislators were arrested and led away by the military police while they were commuting by bus to their workplace. Syngman Rhee administration accused them of being a member of the ‘International Communist Party’ and conspiring against the South Korean government. The legislators were interrogated and held in custody for the next 27 hours. Many members of the National Assembly including the arrested lawmakers have spoken out against Syngman Rhee’s proposal to amend the constitution and extend the presidential term limits. The Vice President Kim Seong-su resigned in protest, and the UN Commission in Korea criticized Syngman Rhee government’s violent behavior."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE52.1.d:0 "Today, the first constitutional amendment of the Republic of Korea was passed. After a month-long martial law period, the constitutional amendment to extend presidential term limits was passed by 163 votes to 3. The previously arrested legislators were released the day before the vote for the purpose of taking part in the constitutional amendment vote. The vote for the constitutional amendment was done by rising the show of hands. The new constitution includes direct election systems for presidential elections and vice-presidential elections, and the nomination and dismissal of cabinet members by the request of the prime minister."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE56.1.d:0 "Chang Myon, the incumbent vice president of the Republic of Korea and a prominent figure of the non-governing party, was shot to the left hand while he was attending the party conference of the Democratic Party. The assassin was caught in the act shortly after the attempt was made. Although the assassin claimed that he was ordered by another member of the Democratic Party to assassinate Chang Myon, many believe that the ruling party and the chairman of the National Assembly, Lee Ki-poong to be the real culprit behind this incident. Because of president Syngman Rhee’s old age, many members of the Liberal Party have long feared the possibility of Chang Myon’s succession of the presidency."
