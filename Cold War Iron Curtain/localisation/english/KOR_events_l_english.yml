 #Samoan Porposal Events
 Samoan_Proposal.1.d:0 "The Pentagon recently presented a new proposal to deal with the Korean refugee crisis. Jeju is very vulnerable to communist aggression, any attempt to strengthen a government in exile could result in renewed conflict with us at the disadvantage. The Pentagon wishes to turn Samoa into the main base for a democratic Korean government in exile. Korean refugees can also be resettled there. Samoa offers a safe base, in the Pacific, from which a future liberation campaign can be waged."
 Samoan_Proposal.2.d:0 "The United States wishes to relocate our government in exile and refugees to Samoa. They promise us extensive autonomy. Samoa is in the Pacific and safety away from communist forces. Our military and political experts note we can rebuild our forces and built our legitimacy without the fear of communist interference. The reality of our circumstances mean even if we do not like the proposal, we cannot really disagree."
 Samoan_Proposal.3.d:0 "The situation in Korea has deteriorated to the point that the United States and its allies are only in control of the island of Jeju. The Korean government wishes that to maintain the island as a forward base for its government in exile. Some in the United States believe they should control the island as an outpost to halt further communist aggression. A US occupation would likely antagonize all parties in the region. A weak Korean occupation could easily be overrun. However, we could look over the territory and protect it as a true Asian bastion against communism. The Foreign Minister will make the request."
 Samoan_Proposal.4.d:0 "The Japanese government requested we give the island of Jeju for their occupation. The Japanese see themselves as the strongest democratic power left in the region who should receive the responsibility. The Korean government wishes to keep control of the island as a forward position and symbol of their continued presence in the peninsula. Our senior commanders on the ground believe we should control the territory to prevent its fall. A Japanese or American occupation could cause unrest and concerns about colonialism. However, the Korean government is still very vulnerable. A decision must be made."
 Samoan_Proposal.5.d:0 "The United States and Korean government agreed to cede the administration of Jeju to our nation. We will take this responsibility to preserve a bastion of democracy on the Korean Peninsula. There is already criticism towards us and the United States consisting of baseless claims we are bringing in a colonial regime. Without our presence the people of Jeju face brutal communist occupation. The people of Japan stands with the suppressed Korean people and will take the solemn responsibility of preserving Jeju."
 Samoan_Proposal.6.d:0 "The United States unfortunately rejected our proposal to oversee Jeju. The Americans noted the Koreans and Chinese would likely be incensed by such an action. They also raised concerns about such an occupation may cause a remilitarization of our nation. These concerns are obviously baseless as we sought to act as a shield and democratic bastion. Despite this short sighted decision, we must remain steadfast and committed to confronting communism in East Asia. The communist threat remains dangerous and potent."
 Samoan_Proposal.7.d:0 "The United States confirmed it would cede the administration and occupation of Jeju to Japan. The Japanese welcomed the move, claiming it stands ready to make its stand to halt the threat of communist aggression in the region. By giving Jeju to Japan the Americans are likely hoping to minimize its own commitment to the region and ensure the island is under a powerful, friendly Asian power. Japan is expected to prevent further communist Korean aggression. Jeju remains the last territory of Korea not under communist rule following the successful North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Chinese and Korean government condemned the decision, calling it a return to brutal Japanese imperialism."
 Samoan_Proposal.8.d:0 "The United States confirmed it would remain the administrative power in Jeju. The American military believes its presence in Jeju will save this last bastion of democratic Korea protected. Although the South Korean and Japanese government both welcomed the news, there are reports of public protests. Protestors accuse the United States of expanding a colonial regime in the region. The communist Korean and Chinese states both condemned American imperialism. American politicians largely welcomed the move as necessary though some did question the continued commitment of American resources to a lost Korea."
 Samoan_Proposal.9.d:0 "The United States Navy confirmed thousands of Korean refugees fleeing communist occupation are currently being transported to Samoa. This is the first wave as the American government plans to move as many refugees as possible. Senior surviving South Korean civil and military leaders are already in Samoa. They are establishing a government of exile and an administrative structure to oversee the arriving refugees. Their is concern among Koreans and other American allies that the new government in Samoa may be too far away or isolated to effect change in Korea. However, the United States insists a base in Samoa offers the best access while maintaining the security of the democratic Korea forces."
 Samoan_Proposal.10.d:0 "The Republic of Korea opened its first session of a new National Assembly in Samoa. Inaugurating the beginning of its new government in exile following the communist takeover of South Korea. The session saw leading military and civil leaders promise to help settle refugees in Samoa and begin preparing for a campaign of national liberation. Much thanks was given to the United States for facilitating the establishment of a capital in Samoa. Although American allies were quick to congratulate the Korean government, the news is being widely mocked in socialist states. The communist Korean government condemned the Samoa regime as American puppets with no comprehension of reality."

 FRAkorea.4.d:0 "In an effort to support the democratically-elected South Korean regime and support her American allies, the French government has sent a battalion sized volunteer force to aid South Korea against the Soviet and Chinese backed North Korea. According to various sources, it will be comprised of more than 3500 troops, with both volunteer and reserve forces. It will be led by Lieutenant General Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, one of France's most decorated war heroes during WW2. With the addition of France in this small scale conflict in East Asia, observers point out that it could lead to an escalation of Cold War tensions, and can bring NATO and the Soviet Union into direct military conflict."
 korea.47.d:0 "Amidst a global climate of discontent towards authority and a national distaste toward the South Korean government, the embers of protest flared there this year. For the past two years, the people of South Korea have been growing ever more resentful of their president, Syngman Rhee, in office since 1948. In 1958, fearing a loss of power, President Rhee forced a shift in the nation's laws that expanded executive power extensively. The following year, Rhee's two largest political rivals for the 1960 presidential election died under suspicious circumstances and one of his closest political allies was elected vice president by fraudulent vote, leading to widespread rumors of Rhee maintaining power by blood and intrigue. This year Koreans announced they'd had enough. What began as a small protest by the Democratic Party exploded in scale after the police killed a student protestor, with a tear gas shell. As protests swelled throughout April, outnumbered soldiers and police fought a losing battle before finally refusing to fire on the marchers. Left at the mercy of his electorate, Rhee was quick to step down and flee the country. The people of South Korea now look to reorganize their republic on a parliamentary model, hoping to curb the power of the executive and ensure that no more corrupt strongmen seize the reins of power."
 korea.48.d:0 "The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to pass resolution 82 in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Soviet Union did not attend the meeting as they are boycotting the Security Council so could not veto. Of the present security council members, only Yugoslavia chose to abstain. The resolution condemns the North Korean invasion and call on member states to assist South Korea and refrain from arming or supporting North Korea. The United State and its allies are heralding the resolution as a major diplomatic victory and analysts believe it will pave the way for more direct American involvement in the conflict. For many member states, especially the United States and Western Europe, there is sympathy to the South Koreans as the memories of World War II and the surprise attacks by the Axis powers remain embedded in the collective memory of its leaders."
 
 #Secretary of Defense question event
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.1.d:0 "The former Secretary of Defense Lee Beom-seok has requested that his resignation be accepted. His role as Prime Minister will remain, but if he resigns as Secretary of Defense, a new figure will have to sit there and take charge of the military. What should we do?"
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.2.d:0 "Shin Sung-mo became the new defense minister. He was a former naval officer and served in the military with the rank of lieutenant general, but recently returned to Korea to assist Rhee Syng-man. He has no actual experience and is considered "military incompetent" by many people, but it may be quite helpful for President Syngman Rhee himself. As soon as he was appointed as Minister of Defense, he is strongly advocating the theory of Korean unification by force."
 #KOR_Secretary_of_Defense.3.d:0 "Admiral Shin Sung-mo demanded the highest rank of navy in exchange for taking the position of defense minister from him. What should we do?"
 #Kim Koo assassination
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.0.d:0 "We gotta prepare for the upcoming event. How it'll work?"
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.1.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea have ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was assassinated today. According to police, Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and shot him 4 times. According to Ahn, he claims that he has sole responsibility for the assassination, claiming it was done of his own fruition, and that no other party played a role in Kim Koo's assassination. He also stated that Kim Koo is allegedly a collaborator with the Soviet Union, and that his presence in South Korea serves as a breeding ground for rebellion and insurgency. However, observers believe otherwise, and they speculate that the assassination attempt was actually orchestrated by the Rhee administration itself in an effort to consolidate power and influence throughout the Republic. Nevertheless, this assassination will be a stain on the Rhee administration's reputation."
 KOR_Kim_Koo_assasination.2.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea almost ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was so close to assassinated today. Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and almost shot him, but right before that, Kim Koo was jumped to him and screamed for help. At that moment, the guards in the residents were quickly running into the house and subdued the suspect. Later this morning, Kim Koo made the statement that the killer that sent to his house was a 'clearly one of president Syngman Rhee's people'. The Kim Koo had no injury, and this assassination attempt will be a dark stain on the Rhee administration's reputation."
 KOR_kimseongsu.2.d:0 "Many citizens were stricken by grief in South Korea as Kim Seong-su, a renowned Korean newspaper owner and a senior politician, passed away of illness in Seoul. During the Japanese occupation period, Kim Seong-su had run various organizations ranging from a press company to textile companies and schools, and contributed to the cultural modernization of Korea. Like many other Korean newspaper owners of his time, Kim Seong-su supported Japanese war effort in several articles. After the liberation of Korea, Kim Seong-su openly reflected on his past activities and became the second vice president of the Republic of Korea. However, he resigned in protest against President Syngman Rhee’s dictatorial behaviors. He has continued advocating democracy until his recent death."
 KOR_yisiyeong.2.d:0 "Many citizens were stricken by grief in South Korea as Yi Si-yeong, a renowned Korean independence activist and a senior politician, passed away of natural causes in Busan. Yi Si-yeong and his family members had devoted their whole life to the Korean independence movement, spending much of their wealth for independence movements both domestic and abroad. After Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Yi Si-yeong was elected the first vice president of the Republic of Korea thanks to his high reputation. His funeral is going to be held near Busan."
 #Syngman Rhee 1948
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.1.d:0 "The official activity of the Special Investigation Committee on Act of Betrayal has been unexpectedly suspended due to a raid on its office building. The culprit behind this raid turned out to be the police force of the Syngman Rhee administration. Syngman Rhee has long been critical of the committee’s investigation on ex-Japanese collaborators in the political, economic, and cultural fields of South Korea, especially the police force. Following the dissolvement of the committee, Syngman Rhee’s administration arrested opponent legislators on charges of being a spy of the Worker’s Party of South Korea. The arrested legislators, including the Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, had played a major role in organizing the committee."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.2.d:0 "In this aternoon, the Bodo league was established. The establishment of this organization was modeled after Daehwasuk, a pro-Japanese conversion group during Japanese colonial era, and is related to the National Security Act, which took effect in December 1948, and it is analyzed that the Korean government needed an institution to systematically protect, manage, and monitor converts. Prosecutor Sunwoo Jong-won and Oh Je-do led the formation process."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.3.d:0 "In this morning, the eradication campaign in Jeju just ended. The First Republic of Korea under President Syngman Rhee escalated the suppression of the uprising from August 1948, declaring martial law in November and beginning an "eradication campaign" against rebel forces in the rural areas of Jeju in March 1949, defeating them within two months. The situation in Jeju doesn't seem good."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.4.d:0 "After independence on August 15, 1945, there were several left-wing parties in South Korea, but the activities of the Korean Communist Party were almost at a standstill, so the three parties (the Communist Party of Korea, the People's Party of Korea, and the New Democratic Party of South Korea) were merged to form the 'Worker's Party of South Korea.' Heo Heon was elected as the first chairman and vice chairman Park Hon-yong was elected. This week, President Syng-man Rhee of the First Republic enacted the National Security Law, ousting all communist forces in the Republic of Korea using public power under the National Security Law."
 KOR_SYNGMANRHEE48.5.d:0 "The day after martial law was declared in Busan, 50 legislators were arrested and led away by the military police while they were commuting by bus to their workplace. Syngman Rhee administration accused them of being a member of the ‘International Communist Party’ and conspiring against the South Korean government. The legislators were interrogated and held in custody for the next 27 hours. Many members of the National Assembly including the arrested lawmakers have spoken out against Syngman Rhee’s proposal to amend the constitution and extend the presidential term limits. The Vice President Kim Seong-su resigned in protest, and the UN Commission in Korea criticized Syngman Rhee government’s violent behavior."
 ##SKnews.4.d:0 "Earlier this morning in Seoul, an assassination attempt against Chang Myon failed. A sniper in the Sigong building attacked the Vice President and he received a penetrating wound to the wrist. Immediately, security forces moved to shield Chang Myon and chase the sniper. The sniper attempted to flee but was arrested. Chang Myon is currently in the hospital seeing to his injuries and an investigation is being mounted. The primary suspect to the incident is the Liberal Party who are the only ones who may desire to kill the vice president. The attack has been publicly condemned by supporters and members of the liberal party."
 ##SKnews.2.d:0 "Cho Bong-am, the former Progressive Party candidate, has been found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death. After his first trial failed to accrue enough evidence to convict him several months ago, a more recent trial had found conclusive evidence that Cho Bang-am had been funded by North Korea. The evidence that Cho Bang-am has been conspiring against South Korea has led to increased tensions between the 2 nations. Already, there is public outrage and fear that North Korea may make another attempt to infiltrate the South Korean government. The heightened state of affairs has led to an increased state of awareness in the country and additional funding to audit systems."
 ##SKnews.1.d:0 "For more than half a millenia, the Korean Peninsula was ruled by a dynasty similar to its neighbor to the north, the Yi Dynasty. However, thanks to inefficient bureaucracy, corruption, and the weakening power of its Qing protectors, the Yi Dynasty was deposed from their rule, and was replaced by the local administration of the Empire of Japan. However, hope for monarchism and the restoration of the Yi Dynasty has been restored, for the Yi Dynasty was able to overthrow the provisional government placed by the United States and overseen by Syngman Rhee and restore their imperial rule over the Southern half of the Korean Peninsula. This chain of events in the Korean Peninsula is unprecedented, and the United States have yet to respond, but are likely to support the monarchist rule. However, the DPRK or North Korea doesn't seemed pleased, and have mobilized more troops to the DMZ to ensure its security."
 ##SKnews.3.d:0 "A period of both national and international uproar has occurred today, as recent evidence has came to light that government forces have organized mass slaughter of civilians in the Republic of Korea. The massacres, organized none other than by the Rhee administration itself, have claimed that these massacres are necessary since the victims are communist sympathizers, people who would institute a revolution if they weren't sacrificed for the nation. Such rhetoric hasn't convinced the people of South Korea or the world rather, with condemnation coming from various nations, with the United States, the sole backer of South Korea, have yet to respond. This act is thought by observers as something that has reinvigorated opposition to the Rhee administration, not acceptance of it."
 ##SKnews.6.d:0 "Democracy is slowly fading to the abyss in the young republic, as President Syngman Rhee has extended term limits for his office, eventually paving the way for an authoritarian regime. While extending term limits is considered by many as nothing since they could simply lose an election, the fact is that the extended term limits coupled with allegations of election fraud have been seen by many observers as a dictatorship. While the Rhee administration hasn't given out an official statement as to why they extended term limits, it is perfectly clear that Syngman Rhee will use this to consolidate his position in South Korea, and ensure opposition to his regime is manageable or even non-existent."
