 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_0:0 "Draken II Class"
 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_0_desc:0 "The Draken class (Dragon) was a submarine class built for the Swedish Navy from 1960 to 1962. A total of six submarines were delivered. Four of the boats were modernised in 1981–82. The design was a modified version of the Hajen-class with only one shaft with a larger 5-bladed propeller for improved underwater performance and reduced noise."

 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_2_desc:0 "The Sjöormen class (Sea serpent) was a class of submarines built for the Swedish Navy in the late 1960s. They had a teardrop hull shape and were capable of diving to 150 metres (490 ft). At the time of their deployment they were regarded as one of the most advanced non-nuclear submarine-classes in the world."
 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_3:0 "Västergötland Class"
 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_3_desc:0 "The Västergötland class of diesel-electric submarines entered service in 1987 in the Swedish Navy allowing the last Draken II class of subs to be retired."
 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_4:0 "Gotland Class"
 SWE_sub_hull_small_single_4_desc:0 "The Gotland-class submarines of the Swedish Navy are modern diesel-electric submarines, which were designed and built by the Kockums shipyard in Sweden. They are the first submarines in the world to feature a Stirling engine air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which extends their underwater endurance from a few days to weeks."

 SWE_sub_hull_large_single_0:0 "Neptun Class"
 SWE_sub_hull_large_single_0_desc:0 "The Neptun-class submarine was a Swedish submarine class built by Kockums. The first submarine was launched in 1942 and a total of three submarines were built; HMSwS Neptun, HMSwS Najad and HMSwS Nacken."
 SWE_sub_hull_large_single_1:0 "Hajen III Class"
 SWE_sub_hull_large_single_1_desc:0 "The Hajen class (Shark class) was a submarine class built by Kockums and used by the Swedish Navy. The design was influenced by the German Type XXI submarine class. A total of 6 submarines were built in 1954-1958 and were kept in service until 1980."
