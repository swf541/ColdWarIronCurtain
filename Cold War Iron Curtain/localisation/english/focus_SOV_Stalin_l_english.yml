Shortly after Stalin’s death, Vasily, in a drunken rage, claimed his father had been poisoned. While thankfully this allegation is baseless and has been not spread outside the confines of the highest in the state, Vasily has remained erratic and a general liability to the Party. After rejecting offers to head a military region, Vasily recently met with foreign diplomats at a restaurant, this has given us an opportunity to arrest Vasily and silence him before he further embarasses the state. Already Vasily has been detained and charged with denigration of the Soviet Union's leaders, anti-Soviet propaganda and criminal negligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison. While unfortunate that it has come to this, a speedy trial under a pseudonym without a defense for Vasily would be in our governments best interests as well as aiding in keeping public order."

These hints towards further engagement with NATO and economic liberalization have raised alarms with more conservative leaders in the party, especially as rumors of renewed purges against Beria’s enemies has become abundant in recent days. As Beria allies continue to be promoted to higher levels in the party, tensions have grown and may be heading towards a breaking point in the coming months. MVD reports have also noted a significant uptick in anti-government sentiment from the Red Army and noted the need to increase surveillance on leading officers and veterans of the Great Patriotic War to mitigate potential conflicts with the armed forces."
 SOV_STL.3.t:0 "Beria raises the issue of ensuring the stability and security of the state"
 SOV_STL.3.desc:0 "As tensions continue to rise in the party and military, First Secretary Beria has raised the issue of ensuring stability and security of the state in a recent meeting of the Presidium. Several issues were discussed throughout the meeting, including the need to ensure the loyalty of the Red Army and seek to undermine subversive elements within the officer corps. Concerns have also been raised about increasing crime rates following the release of inmates from the forced labor camps. The most important issue discussed however, is the subversive and traitorous elements within the high echelons of party leadership. As the fiery meeting concluded, MVD officers hastily seized Presidium members Lazar Kaganovich and Nikita Khruschev. Both have been charged with a host of crimes, most notably treason which carries the death penalty and are now awaiting trial. "

 SOV_STL.4.t:0 "Beria's Great Trials"
 SOV_STL.4.desc:0 "The death of longtime Soviet leader, Josef Stalin created a power vacuum in the Soviet Union which has been manipulated by Minister of Internal Affairs and former NKVD head, Lavrentiy Beria. This came as a major surprise to the international community, especially Beria’s rapid shift to a more reformist position. However, some things never change, reports have begun coming in of the disappearance and executions of various notable party figures that have opposed his rise to power. Notably party notable, Nikita Khruschev and Deputy Premier Lazar Kaganovich have been arrested on charges of treason and other subversive charges and sentenced to death. While no confirmation has been noted either way, rumors of Georgy Zhukov disappearance have abounded and caused significant unease in the Soviet Union. Time will tell if Beria can fully consolidate power and implement his vision for the Union or if the opposition can seize back control of the nation."

 SOV_STL.5.t:0 "Stalin's Cult of Personality Problem"
 SOV_STL.5.desc:0 "One of the most controversial developments during Stalin’s tenure was the development of a cult of personality around the late leader. Throughout Stalin’s rule an extensive cult of personality developed around him, with his death we must now deal with the fallout and legacy of the personality cult. Already some party notables such as former deputy head of Agitprop, Pyotr Pospelov have strongly condemned the personality and cult and have called for extensive Destalinization measures to be implemented. With the power invested in Stalin now being spread out in a more collective leadership structure we now have the opportunity to push back against the perceived cult of the individual. However there are major risks to going too far in this approach. While the broader international communist movement will surely support moves against the idea of personality cults, directly attacking and disparaging the legacy of Stalin will nearly assuredly cause major tensions domestically and internationally and would threaten our near-undisputed leadership of the socialist world."

 SOV_STL.6.desc:0 "Since the death of Stalin, tensions within the party over the leadership of the party and state have escalated, especially between First Secretary Nikia Khruschev and Premier Georgy Malenkov. An upcoming plenary meeting of the Supreme Soviet will provide an opportunity for either side to make a decisive vihitory against either Khruschev or Malenkov. Rumors have already speculated that Khruschev is backing Nikolai Bulganin to replace Malenkov as Premier while Malenkov allies have signaled their desire to seek Khruschev removed from the post of First Secretary. Malenkov being replaced by Bulganin would likely signal the end of internal opposition to Khruschev while Khruschev being removed from office would likely signal an end to Khruschev’s series of reforms and policy changes. Either direction will certainly shape the future of the Union for years to come, how should we proceed?"

Said tensions allegedly have arisen from a perceived exploitation of China by the Soviet Union and the new Soviet leadership’s less confrontational stance towards Washington. However, Soviet leader [SOV.GetLeader] appears to have managed to repair relations between the two nations by establishing new trade agreements, a formal acknowledgement of Stalin's economic unfairness to the PRC, fifteen industrial-development projects, and exchanges of technicians  and political advisors, whilst Chinese laborers were sent to fill shortages of manual workers in Siberia. With the potential of further reforms in the Soviet Union and tensions in the bloc between more Stalinist leaders such as Enver Hoxha and moderates in Moscow, time will tell if this rapprochement is doomed to fail or will kickstart a new era of Soviet-Chinese relations."

The Belgrade Declaration represents a major rapprochement between both socialist nations, notably, the Soviet Union guaranteed noninterference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs and legitimized the right to interpret other forms of socialist development in different countries. This comes after nearly a decade of tense relations between both nations due to the falling out between Tito and Stalin in 1948 which led to increased relations and diplomatic engagement between the United States and Yugoslavia and notably between Yugoslavia and NATO nations in the Balkans. This is a major diplomatic victory for Soviet leader [SOV.GetLeader] and could deter Yugoslavia from furthering diplomatic collaboration with NATO."

Diplomatic representatives from both the Soviet Union and West Germany confirmed recently that Moscow had recently established ties with Bonn. This comes as [SOV.GetLeader] has sought to reduce tensions with the west and seek further diplomatic talks with Western European states. However, the establishment of relations has not led to either West or East Germany to refute their claims of being the sole legitimate government or resolving the ongoing Berlin issue. Unfortunately, the ongoing tensions between both blocs and geopolitical brinkmanship will continue to prevent a reunification of Germany. Conservative critics of Prime Minister [WGR.GetLeader] have attacked the move as a betrayal of the Hallstein Doctrine."

Given the historical issues of food shortages in the territories comprising the Soviet Union, dramatically boosting the Soviet Union's agricultural production in order to alleviate the food shortages plaguing the Soviet populace is of the utmost importance. While some have proposed embarking on a massive expansion of cultivated lands, especially on the right bank of the Volga, in the northern Caucasus, in Western Siberia, and in Northern Kazakhstan. However, this proposal has been tabled given opposition from First Secretary Malenkov and other leading members of the Presidium. Instead, Secretary Malenkov has proposed an expansion of his prior reforms which Malenkov argues would boost agricultural harvest in the Soviet agricultural heartlands. Malenkov’s prior widely praised agricultural reforms included increasing the procurement prices the state paid for collective-farm deliveries, reducing taxes, and encouraging individual peasant plots. Continuing these measures along with investing in further agricultural science and machinery developments would appear to be the new agricultural plan for the Malenkov era."

Given the historical issues of food shortages in the territories comprising the Soviet Union, dramatically boosting the Soviet Union's agricultural production in order to alleviate the food shortages plaguing the Soviet populace is of the utmost importance. First Secretary Khruschev’s proposal would emphasize the plowing and cultivation of 13 million hectares (130,000 km2) of previously uncultivated land by 1956. Targeted lands would include areas on the right bank of the Volga, in the northern Caucasus, in Western Siberia, and in Northern Kazakhstan. Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and other leading CPSU members expressed opposition to the proposal claiming that the plan is not economically or logistically feasible and that focusing on regions already being cultivated would be preferable. However, Khrushchev has insisted on bringing huge amounts of new land under cultivation as the only way to get a major increase in crop yields in a short amount of time. "

However, Beria’s downfall came swiftly, during a June meeting of the Presidium, Nikita Khruschev led an ambush on Beria leading to his arrest on charges of treason and espionage. To ensure that Beria’s allies in the security services could not break out Beria or seek reprisals on other members of the Presidium, military forces under the command of Zhukov directly arrested Beria and proceeded to arrest and execute a swathe of Beria loyalists in the security services. Beria and his allies were tried by a special session of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union in late December, provided with no defense counsel and no right of appeal. Marshal Ivan Konev as chairman of the court.declared Beria guilty of treason due to supposed contacts with the Nazi government to seek peace talks and his purported support for ceding certain gained territories from the Great Patriotic War to normalize diplomatic relations. The court also found Beria guilty of terrorism due to his participation in the 1941 purges in the Red Army and counter-revolutionary activities due to his actions during the Russian Civil War in Azerbaijan. Beria proceeded to be executed by gunshot immediately after the trial bringing an end to one of the most notorious men of the era."

In 1950, during an interrogation of Professor Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger, an eminent, elderly Jewish cardiologist who had treated two prominent CPSU members who died from heart disease and had made critical remarks about the regime in private. Ryumin proceeded to attempt to force him to confess to murdering both Andrei Zhdanov and Alexander Shcherbakov. This event was the origin point of the now denounced  as a fabrication, Doctors’ Plot. After numerous other strenuous interviews and mistreatments by Ryumin, Etinger died. Prior to this, Ryumin had been warned by superiors to relent out of concerns over Etinger’s health. Facing further punishments, Ryumin went directly to Stalin and framed Abakumov and other security personnel for failing to investigate the Doctors’ Plot, leading to Abakumov’s imprisonment and a further rise in station for Ryumin. However, by 1952 Stalin had Ryumin sacked for gross incompetence, following Stalin’s death,Ryumin had been arrested for his complicity in fabricating the Doctors’ Plot leading to his swift execution."

Abakumov had been removed from office and arrested in 1951 on charges of failing to investigate the Doctors' Plot. One may have assumed that given the Doctors’ Plot being dismissed after Stalin’s death that Abakumov would have been released in the aftermath. However, following Stalin’s death, Lavrenty Beria was able to regain control of the security apparatus and charge Abamukov with more crimes of questionable credibility. Now given Beria’s own subsequent fall from power and execution one would again have assumed that Abakumov would have been released at this point. However, following this Abakumov has been painted as an accessory to Beria’s crimes as well. The final nail in Abakumov’s metaphorical and literal nail in the coffin was his role in the fabrication of the Leningrad Affair, which sought to frame various Leningrad based party members for treason, especially those who gained fame during the siege of Leningrad."

Shatalin, a long time ally of Malenkov who ascended to the position of Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of Stalin’s death due to support from Malenkov. Sahtalin has managed to adeptly play the power struggle between Khruschev and Malenkov and is credited with aiding Malenkov in his ousting of Khruschev earlier in the decade. The Shatalin Commission was tasked with inquiring into how it was possible to carry out massive repressions against the members and candidate members of the Party elected at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. Shatalin has recently submitted the commission’s final report to the Presidium, the report moderately critical of Stalin heavily focused on the need for pushing back against the “cult of the individual” has caused a notable amount of controversy in the Presidium. That said, First Secretary Malenkov has signaled his support for the final report and has called on Shatalin to begin preparations for writing a speech on the matter for the upcoming 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

 SOV_STL.17.desc:0 "First Secretary Khruschev recently established a commission headed by noted party functionary Pyotr Pospelov. Pospelov, once the deputy head of Agitprop and an ally of Stalin, quickly shifted to backing Khruschev in the ensuing power struggle in the aftermath of Stalin’s death. However, Pospelov surprised many by becoming one of the earliest notable supporters of Destalinization months after Stalin’s death. The Pospelov Commission was tasked with inquiring into how it was possible to carry out massive repressions against the members and candidate members of the Party elected at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. Pospelov has recently submitted the commission’s final report to the Presidium, the report heavily critical of Stalin and pushing for major effort to be placed in further condemnation of Stalin and rehabilitation of purged members during his tenure has caused a firestorm of controversy in the Presidium. That said, First Secretary Khruschev has signaled his support for the final report and has called on Pospelov to begin preparations for writing a speech on the matter for the upcoming 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

 SOV_STL.18.desc:0 "As 1956 comes to a close, the Virgin Lands campaign appears to be on the cusp of becoming a truly crowning achievement in the history of agricultural development. While enthusiasm for the program had deteriorated after a dismal performance in 1955, the harvest of 1956 proved to be the most successful of the entire Virgin Lands campaign to date and the largest in Soviet history. Grain output for Virgin Lands regions increased by 180% compared to the average of 1949–1953 and 90% compared to the 1954–1955 average. The grain output in 1956 of the entire Soviet Union was 50% higher than the 1949–53 average. Given this amazing harvest, First Secretary Khruschev has taken a tour of northern Kazakhstan to hand out medals to farmers in the Virgin Lands region. That said, agriculturalists have warned that the record harvest may not be repeatable in future years and that climate and soil quality in the region will likely result in wildly shifting harvest rates in the coming years."

 Beria_Arriest.1.d:0 "Head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria, once seemed to be in a position to take the reigns of the Soviet Union following the death of Stalin. However, his scheming would fall short as his rivals were one step ahead. During a meeting with his close advisors, military forces would circumvent the NKVD and arrest Beria and his collaborators. With one of the darkest figures of the Stalin era in jail, what awaits the future of the Soviet Union remains undecided as many figures still hold great sway over the Politburo."

Loafers and truants often feel at ease; their wages and other benefits are on a par with conscientious workers. The ministries, departments, and economic managers do not create the necessary organizational and economic conditions at individual enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, and state farms for normal high-performance work. Deficiencies in planning, logistics, and production organization lead to downtime and storm work, overtime work, and failure to fulfil planned targets and obligations, negatively affecting discipline and, ultimately, the growth rate of labour productivity. Some enterprise managers, party and trade union organizations have come to terms with the low level of labour discipline, hide the facts of mismanagement, and do not take all the measures in their power to restore order in production. By Decree No. 744, while applying material and moral incentives for selfless work, it is necessary at the same time to resolutely eradicate the facts of a conciliatory attitude towards violators of labour and production discipline, to more effectively use measures of public influence, the norms of the current legislation for this purpose. Violations of labour discipline should be considered as evasion from fulfilling the obligation to work conscientiously, established by the Constitution of the USSR. Issues of the state of labour discipline and measures to strengthen it, cases of absenteeism and other violations for the appropriate public impact on violators should be constantly brought up for discussion by labour collectives, meetings of brigades, sites, farms, workshops, questions should be raised before the administration about bringing such persons to responsibility in accordance with current legislation."

 SOV_WGR.1.d:0 "From; First Main Directorate, Ministry of State Security\nTo; General Secretary Stalin\n\nSubject; The 1949 West German Election and Threats to Socialist Fraternal Brotherhood\n\nThe First Main Directorate, being primarily responsible for foreign intelligence, has examined and watched closely the campaign in the Federal Republic of Germany's first election, expected to take place before the end of 1949. There are three parties principally running; the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer; the Social Democratic Party (SPD), led by Kurt Schumacher; and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), led by Franz Blucher. However, the Communist Party of Germany remains a viable candidate in the election; being led by prominent German communist Max Reimann.\n\nThe First Main Directorate has offered a number of proposals to shift the outcome of the West German election in our favor, including sending more MGB agents to West Germany, sending financial aid to the KPD, and rigging votes in the favor of the KPD. We expect that Reimann will be on board with Soviet policy in the future, and anticipate that these election interference measures will ensure our success, while destabilizing the Western imperialist bloc.\n\nSIGNED\nViktor Abakumov\nChief of the First Directorate of the Committee for State Security"
 SOV_WGR.2.d:0 "From; G-2 Intelligence Branch, U.S. Army Europe, Allied Occupational Authorities\nTo; Provisional Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nSubject; Threats to the Security of the 1949 Federal Election\n\nRecent actions by the USSR and its satellite states have revealed a key vulnerability in the security of the Federal Republic's upcoming parliamentary elections. Recent leaks from our agents behind the Iron Curtain as well as in the Federal Republic have revealed alleged plots to shift the results of the election in the USSR's favor by rigging votes towards the Communist Party of Germany, or KPD, led by famed communist Max Reimann. Our agents have also reported a marked increase in MGB agents, as well as pro-KPD propaganda in major German cities.\n\nThe effects of this election tampering may be catastrophic; if Germany becomes communist, this will affect not only NATO and Western European security, but the balance of power globally.\n\nImmediate condemnation of election interference and arresting of MGB agents, as well as tighter election security, should guarantee a safe and democratic election for the Federal Republic.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneral Lucius D. Clay\nCommanding General, United States Army Europe"

Finally, Central Asia has been proposed, including the Kazakh SSR, Krygyz SSR, Turkmen SSR, Tajik SSR and Uzbek SSR; and would certainly help with internal mobility, as well as industrial development.

A new and unexpected alternative has also emerged; moving heavy industry to Central Asia, either the Kazakh SSR or Tajik SSR, both of whom have open space and resources. Where shall the industry go?"

 SOV_Stalin_Dismantle_The_Jewish_Anti_Fascist_Committee_desc:0 "The JAC was originally formed under the guise of spreading the glory of Communism and the Union abroad to fellow Jewish communities, but it is now clear what they truly intend. The JAC is nothing more than a tool of the Bourgeoisie."

 STALIN_Invest_in_the_Baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic region has suffered much in the past few decades, being assimilated into the Union less than a few years before being run over by the German War Machine, and then bearing the effects of Scorched Earth policies. Investing in to the area will only do good."

 STALIN_The_Soviet_Airforce_desc:0 "Our air force was a large part of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, as our fearless aviators crushed the Luftwaffe into submission. But, a new age of flight has come, this time powered by the Jet Engine, and we need to leap into this age fullhearted."

 STALIN_Rapid_Adoption_of_the_AK47_desc:0 "The AK-47 is the latest brilliant design to come from Mikhail Kalashnikov, and it is a beautiful assault rifle with an innovative design- yet still cheap to manufacture. We need to start producing this right away."

 STALIN_Ramp_Up_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "Submarines are the only chance we have at doing any damage to Western Ships or shipping if we ever come to conflict. We need to make sure our fleet is up to the task."
 
 SOV_Stalin_Establish_the_Malenkov_Khrushchev_and_Beria_Troika_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Stalin's death, a three-man advisory body, or troika, has been set up to continue the role of the government. Composed of Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev, and Lavrentiy Beria, this group is a fragile one."
 SOV_Stalin_Investigate_Berias_and_Khrushchevs_Activities_desc:0 "Beria's and Khrushchev's activities and actions in purges and other actions within the Party deserve a second look, especially as they are 2 out of the 3 most important men in the USSR."

 SOV_Stalin_Re_Empower_the_Secretariat_desc:0 "In his later years especially, Comrade Stalin set about sidelining the Party and making our Communist State more of one man show. It is time restore the Communist Party to its rightful place in our society."
 SOV_Stalin_Send_Back_West_German_POWs_desc:0 "Having captured thousands of German soldiers towards the end of the Great Patriotic War, we really have no need for them. This would be a gesture of good faith to the West, that they will get back their prisoners."

 SOV_Stalin_Establish_A_New_Diplomatic_Stance_desc:0 "Our new diplomatic stance will appear to the west as a softer one, perhaps turning the Iron Curtain into a chain-link fence.

 SOV_Kaganovichs_Union_desc:0 "Comrade Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich has assumed the post of General Secretary of the CPSU in the wake of Comrade Stalin's retirement. Widely seen as a staunch supporter of Stalin's policies, Kaganovich has promised to guide the People and Party to new heights. The Soviet Union seems poised to turn inward, putting its efforts toward the realization of Socialism in One Country."

 SOV_Step_Away_From_the_Personality_Cult_desc:0 "Although the deeds of Comrade Stalin are countless, and his actions not only saved the Soviet Union in its darkest moments but also empowered the Union towards progress, he was one of many who dedicated their life to the Marxist-Leninist cause. We must avoid maintaining the cult of personality that has grown around him, lest we fall into deification and dogmatism."

 SOV_Focus_on_the_Greater_Good_desc:0 "Collectivism is one of the most important values of both our ideology and people. While the imperialists view their own countrymen as tools to be exploited, Comrade Lenin taught us the way of a true civilization. We must refocus our propaganda toward the dedication and heroism of the Soviet people, the torchbearers of the communist cause."
 SOV_Refocus_Propaganda_Toward_Lenin:0 "Refocus Propaganda Toward Lenin"
 SOV_Refocus_Propaganda_Toward_Lenin_desc:0 "During Comrade Stalin's leadership, a Cult of Personality was created around him. Though Stalin was a great man, in this case, he was in error. Stalin was but a faithful servant of Lenin, and we must teach our people once more to not be loyal to men, but to the Soviet ideal. Lenin lived, Lenin lives, and Lenin will live as long as we remain loyal to Lenin's cause."
 SOV_Empathise_the_Collective_Leadership:0 "Emphasize the Collective Leadership"
 SOV_Empathise_the_Collective_Leadership_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is not an autocracy like the Russian Empire before her. Comrade Kaganovich might be the first among equals, but the Politburo as a whole must particpate in the governance of our great Union, upholding the values of Soviet Democracy."
 SOV_Internal_Work_on_Errors:0 "Internal Work on Errors"
 SOV_Internal_Work_on_Errors_desc:0 "A communist must never sit on his laurels. The imperialists work every day to grow their power, and so we must look inward and engage in our own program of reform. This is not a betrayal of communist ideas, but a completion of it. We will restore the Party apparatus to full working order, from the smallest villages to the Central Committee itself. "

 SOV_Strengthen_the_party_Structure_and_Legality_desc:0 "Regulations and rules are necessary to keep the functionality of any system going. As we move from the Dictatorship of the Proletariat to a proper Rule of Law, we will codify CPSU bylaws to fight corruption and abuse and democratize the Party apparatus so all members will have their voices heard. The collectivization of the Party is the victory of Communism."

 SOV_Analyse_COMECON_Efficency_desc:0 "The COMECON was created by Comrade Stalin as an answer to the American-led Marshall Plan, promoting trade and common economic planning between the states of the Eastern Bloc. Unfortunately, it has been rife with inefficiency and seen by many of our economists as a drain on the treasury. We must analyze its failures and restructure COMECON into a worthy vessel of the friendship of peoples."
 SOV_Recreate_the_Komintern:0 "Rebirth of the Komintern"
 SOV_Recreate_the_Komintern_desc:0 "After Stalin's formulation of "Socialism in One Country," the Soviet Union retreated from its goal of spreading the Revolution. This was a necessary evil at the time - the Union was weak and lacked international recognition. Now that we are a force to be reckoned with, we have no reason to concede to capitalism any longer. The Komintern will stand ready to support the workers of the world wherever they may rise against Capital."

 SOV_Start_the_program_of_Militsiya_Motorization_desc:0 "The Militsiya are responsible for law enforcement in the country, equivalent to police officers in the western democracies. Allocating more modern police cars for the militsioners will make stopping crime a far easier task and keep our streets safe. No one who steals from the Soviet people will get away."

Though he was certainly right to root out the would-be capitalists from the Party, our prison population is unreasonably high. Comrade Kaganovich has proposed a general amnesty for many GULAG inmates and a commission to study the cases of certain more high-profile prisoners. Let no one say the Party is not merciful."

 SOV_Begin_Internal_Bond_Repayment_desc:0 "Like many countries, the Soviet government raises revenue through the sale of state bonds. However, this results in the accumulation of debt, much of which is owed to our own citizens.

 SOV_Introduce_Peoples_Control_Committee_desc:0 "The People's Control Commission Committee is a semi-governmental organization consisting of the Soviet masses who volunteer their time to scrutinize the conduct of government officials. Though the idea has existed since 1920 in some shape or form, Comrade Kaganovich has expanded their authority. PCCCs will have the power to reprimand, fine, or even press charges against corrupt officials."

 SOV_Replace_Lysenko_System_desc:0 "During the Stalin era, biologist Trofim Lysenko's eccentric theories on genetics and agriculture were endorsed by the state, with traditional Mendelian geneticists persecuted. Poor crop yields over the years have proven Lysenkoism to be a failure at best and quackery at worst with our current understanding of science. We will rejoin the scientific community when it comes to genetics and get our agriculture back on track."

 SOV_Reform_Gardening_and_livestock_Ownership:0 "Reform Gardening and Livestock Ownership"
 SOV_Reform_Gardening_and_livestock_Ownership_desc:0 "During the process of collectivization, farmers were allotted small private plots for their homes. Analyses of our kolkhozes have repeatedly shown that the private plots have become essential for our food supplies. Though a return to the days of kulaks is out of the question, expanding private plots and livestock will improve morale and standards of living on the collective farms."
 SOV_Create_Roadmap_for_Internal_Debt_Repayment:0 "Create Roadmap for Internal Debt Repayment"
 SOV_Create_Roadmap_for_Internal_Debt_Repayment_desc:0 "Our initial repayment of internal debt was a good start but we need to establish a solid plan for repaying the rest of our debts back to the people. Though it might limit our spending on other affairs of state, ensuring the continued solvency of our financial system and the trust of our people is worth any price."
 SOV_Principle_of_Budgetary_Responsability:0 "Principle of Budgetary Responsibility"
 SOV_Principle_of_Budgetary_Responsability_desc:0 "The Soviet people cannot spend more money than they have, yet their government can.

 SOV_Focus_on_application_of_Leninist_Principles_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism is Marxism put into action, the science that guides our path to communism.

 SOV_Maintain_Unity_of_Central_Comittee_and_Party_Apparatus_desc:0 "The Party apparatus is an enormous machine operated by a very small Central Committee.

 SOV_Introduce_People_Control_Into_Law_Enforcement_desc:0 "The Soviet Militisya are meant to protect the people from crime.

 SOV_Strengthen_Procurator_Office_And_Expand_PPC_Cooperation_desc:0 "Realizing the principle of popular control over law enforcement, the PCC will be given authority to refer wrongdoing by militsioners to the procurators.

 SOV_Improve_Militsoners_Training_and_Equipment:0 "Improve Militsioners' Training and Equipment"
 SOV_Improve_Militsoners_Training_and_Equipment_desc:0 "The Militsiya has slacked in its duties to fight crime and protect the Soviet people. Comrade Kaganovich has ordered that the Militisiya be given access to whatever weapons, vehicles, and equipment it needs to keep the peace. New and current militiamen will be subject to stricter training and discipline standards as well, to ensure they are worthy of the trust we give them."
 SOV_Hire_More_Rural_Militsioners:0 "Hire More Rural Militsioners"

 SOV_Strengthen_High_Level_Party_Disciplines_desc:0 "The highest ranks of our Party are afforded the highest powers, but with great power comes great responsibility.

 SOV_Prepare_Finnish_Defense_measures_desc:0 "The Finnish government might maintain friendly relations with us, but their rehabilitation of war criminals and aggressors against the Soviet people proves they cannot be trusted. A larger military presence must be established near our land and maritime borders with the Finns in case they forget their place."
 SOV_Establish_new_garrisons_on_the_Baltic_Coast:0 "Establish New Garrisons on the Baltic Coast"
 SOV_Establish_new_garrisons_on_the_Baltic_Coast_desc:0 "The Baltic Fleet is largely based in Kaliningrad, but there are other key locations on the Baltic coast, such as the city of Riga. New army bases will be built and more troops assigned to the region to protect the Soviet Baltics."
 SOV_Expand_the_bases_in_the_Barents_Sea:0 "Expand the Bases in the Barents Sea"
 SOV_Expand_the_bases_in_the_Barents_Sea_desc:0 "The frigid Barents Sea is the stomping grounds of our Northern Fleet, even if their reach covers far more. Though most of the northern islands are inhospitable to permanent human settlement, with some not even discovered until the 1920s, some weather monitoring and radar stations could help us keep an eye on NATO activity."
 SOV_Build_Fortifications_in_Murmansk:0 "Build Fortifications in Murmansk"
 SOV_Build_Fortifications_in_Murmansk_desc:0 "The port of Murmansk is the home of our Northern Fleet, essential to our growing numbers of long-range submarines. However, Murmansk itself is vulnerable to both air and naval attack, especially from NATO assets stationed in nearby Norway. A network of anti-ship defenses and new anti-air equipment would go a long way toward protecting our northern outpost."
 SOV_Expand_Missile_Defense_System_in_Kaliningrad:0 "Expand Missile Defense System in Kaliningrad"
 SOV_Expand_Missile_Defense_System_in_Kaliningrad_desc:0 "Kaliningrad is one of our most important bases on the Baltic sea, and with its proximity to the West it will surely be one of the first places western aircraft head for in the event of war. Kaliningrad will be a defiant bastion against the Imperialists, armed to the teeth with the best anti-ship and anti-air missiles in our arsenal."
 SOV_Favourize_Troops_Mobility:0 "Favorize Troops Mobility"
 SOV_Favourize_Troops_Mobility_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is the largest country on Earth, and defending her is no easy task. The American "Interstate" project has provided our military minds with some inspiration. The boys at GOSPLAN might grumble at the cost, but a mobile army is a necessity for defending the Revolution from Berlin to Vladivostok."
 SOV_Request_new_Artillery_Systems:0 "Request new Artillery Systems"
 SOV_Request_new_Artillery_Systems_desc:0 "Waves upon waves of artillery sent the Germans running back to Berlin in the last war. An updated arsenal, complete with long=range pieces and SPGs, will surely send NATO running back to Washington in the next war."
 SOV_Extend_Interceptors_Production_chain:0 "Extend Interceptors Production Chain"
 SOV_Extend_Interceptors_Production_chain_desc:0 "NATO nuclear strategy relies on fleets of long-range, high-altitude jet bombers like the B-52 and Avro Vulcan to pierce our air defenses. Building more interceptors will be key to protecting the Motherland from a preemptive nuclear strike."
 SOV_Create_Fortified_Region_South:0 "Create Fortified Region South"
 SOV_Create_Fortified_Region_South_desc:0 "The southwestern regions of our country are diverse in terrain, peoples, and industries. From the rebuilt Hero-City of Stalingrad to the coasts of Crimea and the ever-crucial oil of Azerbaijan, the Motherland would face disaster were we to leave them as a soft underbelly for our enemies."
 SOV_Build_Nuclear_Bunkers_in_the_Caucasus:0 "Build Nuclear Bunkers in the Caucasus"
 SOV_Build_Nuclear_Bunkers_in_the_Caucasus_desc:0 "The Caucasian mountains are highly defensible and would pose a daunting task for any enemy to conquer. This makes it perfect for constructing networks of highly protected fallout shelters in the event of nuclear war."
 SOV_Expand_Moldova_Bunkers_Network:0 "Expand the Moldavian Bunker Network"
 SOV_Expand_Moldova_Bunkers_Network_desc:0 "Moldavia's defenses are...lacking to say the least. With the provision of some additional funds we can build a respectable network of bunkers to protect our troops and essential civilians against both conventional and nuclear attacks."
 SOV_Modernize_Crimean_Coastal_Defense:0 "Modernize Crimean Coastal Defenses"
 SOV_Modernize_Crimean_Coastal_Defense_desc:0 "The Crimea is central to our control of the Black Sea. With many of our anti-ship and anti-air defenses on the peninsula now outdated, Sevastopol is vulnerable to an attack by NATO forces, just as it was by Germany during the Great Patriotic War. The Black Sea Fleet, pride of the Soviet Navy, shall only have the finest of protection."
 SOV_Protect_the_Black_Sea_Touristic_Coast:0 "Protect the Black Sea Coast"
 SOV_Protect_the_Black_Sea_Touristic_Coast_desc:0 "The Black Sea coast has some of the finest resorts and sanatoriums in the Motherland for our workers to enjoy, but is wholly unprotected from possible air strikes or invasions. New anti-air defenses and barracks for troops stationed on the coasts will ensure that this paradise in peace will be hell for our enemies in war."
 SOV_Boost_Nuclear_Delivry_Systems:0 "Boost Nuclear Delivery Systems"
 SOV_Boost_Nuclear_Delivry_Systems_desc:0 "Our nuclear arsenal is large enough to destroy the world several times over. Our nuclear weapons infastructure, on the other hand, is not. No efforts must be spared in bringing our missile and silo systems up to par with the West and ready to strike at a moment's notice."
 SOV_Create_Fortified_District_Central:0 "Create Fortified District Central"
 SOV_Create_Fortified_District_Central_desc:0 "In the case of war, Central Russia is vulnerable to ground attack because it is not fortified by any means. Regions like Smolensk, Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod would be the first line of defense of Moscow if the invasion comes from the West. Creating a fortified district in these oblasts will ensure our industrial and political heartlands are ready for anything."
 SOV_Build_More_Nuclear_Bunkers_in_the_Moscow_Area:0 "Build More Nuclear Bunkers in the Moscow Area"
 SOV_Build_More_Nuclear_Bunkers_in_the_Moscow_Area_desc:0 "Moscow is our capital, the beating heart of the Soviet Motherland. If it dies, our Motherland may very well die with it. If nuclear war becomes reality, we will be prepared. An extensive network of fallout shelters and bunkers will be built to protect our government officials and other important residents of Moscow, ensuring that the Motherland will live on."
 SOV_Boost_Western_Regions_Defensive_Missiles_Silos:0 "Boost Western SSR Defensive Missile Silos"
 SOV_Boost_Western_Regions_Defensive_Missiles_Silos_desc:0 "When the Nazis invaded in 1941, Belarus and Ukraine were the first to fall to the German advance. We were unprepared, leaving the door to our Motherland wide open. Were war to reach our borders once more, we cannot repeat the same mistake twice. A network of tactical nuclear weapons in the region will provide a strong deterrent to any foreign invader."
 SOV_Protect_Central_Asian_Republics_Airspace:0 "Protect Central Asian Airspace"
 SOV_Protect_Central_Asian_Republics_Airspace_desc:0 "The republics of Central Asia have become home to a rapidly growing industry and high-technology sector. We can no longer treat these lands as empty deserts. Though protecting so vast an area will be no easy task, we cannot let our enemies view an inch of Soviet territory as vulnerable."
 SOV_Expand_Urals_and_Siberian_Military_Infrastructures:0 "Expand Urals and Siberian Military Infrastructure"
 SOV_Expand_Urals_and_Siberian_Military_Infrastructures_desc:0 "The Urals and Siberia are vast in size and though sparse in population, are rich in natural resources. An ambitious program of railroad and road construction for the express use of the military, new air defenses, and a network of secret nuclear silos will keep even the farthest reaches of our Motherland safe."
 SOV_Improve_Ground_Based_Air_Defence_Network:0 "Improve Ground Based Air Defence Network"
 SOV_Improve_Ground_Based_Air_Defence_Network_desc:0 "The story of aviation is one of constant competition, and our western adversaries have given us more than a match in military aviation. The only way we can truly protect our Motherland is by creating an unparalleled air defense force. If anyone gets through the Soviet Air Force, a SAM will be the last thing they never see."
