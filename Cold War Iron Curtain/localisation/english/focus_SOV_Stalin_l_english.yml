Shortly after Stalin’s death, Vasily, in a drunken rage, claimed his father had been poisoned. While thankfully this allegation is baseless and has been not spread outside the confines of the highest in the state, Vasily has remained erratic and a general liability to the Party. After rejecting offers to head a military region, Vasily recently met with foreign diplomats at a restaurant, this has given us an opportunity to arrest Vasily and silence him before he further embarasses the state. Already Vasily has been detained and charged with denigration of the Soviet Union's leaders, anti-Soviet propaganda and criminal negligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison. While unfortunate that it has come to this, a speedy trial under a pseudonym without a defense for Vasily would be in our governments best interests as well as aiding in keeping public order."

These hints towards further engagement with NATO and economic liberalization have raised alarms with more conservative leaders in the party, especially as rumors of renewed purges against Beria’s enemies has become abundant in recent days. As Beria allies continue to be promoted to higher levels in the party, tensions have grown and may be heading towards a breaking point in the coming months. MVD reports have also noted a significant uptick in anti-government sentiment from the Red Army and noted the need to increase surveillance on leading officers and veterans of the Great Patriotic War to mitigate potential conflicts with the armed forces."

 SOV_STL.3.desc:0 "As tensions continue to rise in the party and military, First Secretary Beria has raised the issue of ensuring stability and security of the state in a recent meeting of the Presidium. Several issues were discussed throughout the meeting, including the need to ensure the loyalty of the Red Army and seek to undermine subversive elements within the officer corps. Concerns have also been raised about increasing crime rates following the release of inmates from the forced labor camps. The most important issue discussed however, is the subversive and traitorous elements within the high echelons of party leadership. As the fiery meeting concluded, MVD officers hastily seized Presidium members Lazar Kaganovich and Nikita Khruschev. Both have been charged with a host of crimes, most notably treason which carries the death penalty and are now awaiting trial. "

 SOV_STL.4.desc:0 "The death of longtime Soviet leader, Josef Stalin created a power vacuum in the Soviet Union which has been manipulated by Minister of Internal Affairs and former NKVD head, Lavrentiy Beria. This came as a major surprise to the international community, especially Beria’s rapid shift to a more reformist position. However, some things never change, reports have begun coming in of the disappearance and executions of various notable party figures that have opposed his rise to power. Notably party notable, Nikita Khruschev and Deputy Premier Lazar Kaganovich have been arrested on charges of treason and other subversive charges and sentenced to death. While no confirmation has been noted either way, rumors of Georgy Zhukov disappearance have abounded and caused significant unease in the Soviet Union. Time will tell if Beria can fully consolidate power and implement his vision for the Union or if the opposition can seize back control of the nation."

 SOV_STL.5.t:0 "Stalin's Cult of Personality Problem"
 SOV_STL.5.desc:0 "One of the most controversial developments during Stalin’s tenure was the development of a cult of personality around the late leader. Throughout Stalin’s rule an extensive cult of personality developed around him, with his death we must now deal with the fallout and legacy of the personality cult. Already some party notables such as former deputy head of Agitprop, Pyotr Pospelov have strongly condemned the personality and cult and have called for extensive Destalinization measures to be implemented. With the power invested in Stalin now being spread out in a more collective leadership structure we now have the opportunity to push back against the perceived cult of the individual. However there are major risks to going too far in this approach. While the broader international communist movement will surely support moves against the idea of personality cults, directly attacking and disparaging the legacy of Stalin will nearly assuredly cause major tensions domestically and internationally and would threaten our near-undisputed leadership of the socialist world."

An upcoming plenary meeting of the Supreme Soviet will provide an opportunity for either side to make a decisive vihitory against either Khruschev or Malenkov. Rumors have already speculated that Khruschev is backing Nikolai Bulganin to replace Malenkov as Premier while Malenkov allies have signaled their desire to seek Khruschev removed from the post of First Secretary. Malenkov being replaced by Bulganin would likely signal the end of internal opposition to Khruschev while Khruschev being removed from office would likely signal an end to Khruschev’s series of reforms and policy changes. Either direction will certainly shape the future of the Union for years to come, how should we proceed?"

Said tensions allegedly have arisen from a perceived exploitation of China by the Soviet Union and the new Soviet leadership’s less confrontational stance towards Washington. However, Soviet leader [SOV.GetLeader] appears to have managed to repair relations between the two nations by establishing new trade agreements, a formal acknowledgement of Stalin's economic unfairness to the PRC, fifteen industrial-development projects, and exchanges of technicians  and political advisors, whilst Chinese laborers were sent to fill shortages of manual workers in Siberia. With the potential of further reforms in the Soviet Union and tensions in the bloc between more Stalinist leaders such as Enver Hoxha and moderates in Moscow, time will tell if this rapprochement is doomed to fail or will kickstart a new era of Soviet-Chinese relations."

The Belgrade Declaration represents a major rapprochement between both socialist nations, notably, the Soviet Union guaranteed noninterference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs and legitimized the right to interpret other forms of socialist development in different countries. This comes after nearly a decade of tense relations between both nations due to the falling out between Tito and Stalin in 1948 which led to increased relations and diplomatic engagement between the United States and Yugoslavia and notably between Yugoslavia and NATO nations in the Balkans. This is a major diplomatic victory for Soviet leader [SOV.GetLeader] and could deter Yugoslavia from furthering diplomatic collaboration with NATO."

Diplomatic representatives from both the Soviet Union and West Germany confirmed recently that Moscow had recently established ties with Bonn. This comes as [SOV.GetLeader] has sought to reduce tensions with the west and seek further diplomatic talks with Western European states. However, the establishment of relations has not led to either West or East Germany to refute their claims of being the sole legitimate government or resolving the ongoing Berlin issue. Unfortunately, the ongoing tensions between both blocs and geopolitical brinkmanship will continue to prevent a reunification of Germany. Conservative critics of Prime Minister [WGR.GetLeader] have attacked the move as a betrayal of the Hallstein Doctrine."

Given the historical issues of food shortages in the territories comprising the Soviet Union, dramatically boosting the Soviet Union's agricultural production in order to alleviate the food shortages plaguing the Soviet populace is of the utmost importance. While some have proposed embarking on a massive expansion of cultivated lands, especially on the right bank of the Volga, in the northern Caucasus, in Western Siberia, and in Northern Kazakhstan. However, this proposal has been tabled given opposition from First Secretary Malenkov and other leading members of the Presidium. Instead, Secretary Malenkov has proposed an expansion of his prior reforms which Malenkov argues would boost agricultural harvest in the Soviet agricultural heartlands. Malenkov’s prior widely praised agricultural reforms included increasing the procurement prices the state paid for collective-farm deliveries, reducing taxes, and encouraging individual peasant plots. Continuing these measures along with investing in further agricultural science and machinery developments would appear to be the new agricultural plan for the Malenkov era."

Given the historical issues of food shortages in the territories comprising the Soviet Union, dramatically boosting the Soviet Union's agricultural production in order to alleviate the food shortages plaguing the Soviet populace is of the utmost importance. First Secretary Khruschev’s proposal would emphasize the plowing and cultivation of 13 million hectares (130,000 km2) of previously uncultivated land by 1956. Targeted lands would include areas on the right bank of the Volga, in the northern Caucasus, in Western Siberia, and in Northern Kazakhstan. Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and other leading CPSU members expressed opposition to the proposal claiming that the plan is not economically or logistically feasible and that focusing on regions already being cultivated would be preferable. However, Khrushchev has insisted on bringing huge amounts of new land under cultivation as the only way to get a major increase in crop yields in a short amount of time. "

However, Beria’s downfall came swiftly, during a June meeting of the Presidium, Nikita Khruschev led an ambush on Beria leading to his arrest on charges of treason and espionage. To ensure that Beria’s allies in the security services could not break out Beria or seek reprisals on other members of the Presidium, military forces under the command of Zhukov directly arrested Beria and proceeded to arrest and execute a swathe of Beria loyalists in the security services. Beria and his allies were tried by a special session of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union in late December, provided with no defense counsel and no right of appeal. Marshal Ivan Konev as chairman of the court.declared Beria guilty of treason due to supposed contacts with the Nazi government to seek peace talks and his purported support for ceding certain gained territories from the Great Patriotic War to normalize diplomatic relations. The court also found Beria guilty of terrorism due to his participation in the 1941 purges in the Red Army and counter-revolutionary activities due to his actions during the Russian Civil War in Azerbaijan. Beria proceeded to be executed by gunshot immediately after the trial bringing an end to one of the most notorious men of the era."

In 1950, during an interrogation of Professor Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger, an eminent, elderly Jewish cardiologist who had treated two prominent CPSU members who died from heart disease and had made critical remarks about the regime in private. Ryumin proceeded to attempt to force him to confess to murdering both Andrei Zhdanov and Alexander Shcherbakov. This event was the origin point of the now denounced  as a fabrication, Doctors’ Plot. After numerous other strenuous interviews and mistreatments by Ryumin, Etinger died. Prior to this, Ryumin had been warned by superiors to relent out of concerns over Etinger’s health. Facing further punishments, Ryumin went directly to Stalin and framed Abakumov and other security personnel for failing to investigate the Doctors’ Plot, leading to Abakumov’s imprisonment and a further rise in station for Ryumin. However, by 1952 Stalin had Ryumin sacked for gross incompetence, following Stalin’s death,Ryumin had been arrested for his complicity in fabricating the Doctors’ Plot leading to his swift execution."

Abakumov had been removed from office and arrested in 1951 on charges of failing to investigate the Doctors' Plot. One may have assumed that given the Doctors’ Plot being dismissed after Stalin’s death that Abakumov would have been released in the aftermath. However, following Stalin’s death, Lavrenty Beria was able to regain control of the security apparatus and charge Abamukov with more crimes of questionable credibility. Now given Beria’s own subsequent fall from power and execution one would again have assumed that Abakumov would have been released at this point. However, following this Abakumov has been painted as an accessory to Beria’s crimes as well. The final nail in Abakumov’s metaphorical and literal nail in the coffin was his role in the fabrication of the Leningrad Affair, which sought to frame various Leningrad based party members for treason, especially those who gained fame during the siege of Leningrad."

Sahtalin has managed to adeptly play the power struggle between Khruschev and Malenkov and is credited with aiding Malenkov in his ousting of Khruschev earlier in the decade. The Shatalin Commission was tasked with inquiring into how it was possible to carry out massive repressions against the members and candidate members of the Party elected at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. Shatalin has recently submitted the commission’s final report to the Presidium, the report moderately critical of Stalin heavily focused on the need for pushing back against the “cult of the individual” has caused a notable amount of controversy in the Presidium.

However, Pospelov surprised many by becoming one of the earliest notable supporters of Destalinization months after Stalin’s death. The Pospelov Commission was tasked with inquiring into how it was possible to carry out massive repressions against the members and candidate members of the Party elected at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. Pospelov has recently submitted the commission’s final report to the Presidium, the report heavily critical of Stalin and pushing for major effort to be placed in further condemnation of Stalin and rehabilitation of purged members during his tenure has caused a firestorm of controversy in the Presidium.

While enthusiasm for the program had deteriorated after a dismal performance in 1955, the harvest of 1956 proved to be the most successful of the entire Virgin Lands campaign to date and the largest in Soviet history. Grain output for Virgin Lands regions increased by 180% compared to the average of 1949–1953 and 90% compared to the 1954–1955 average. The grain output in 1956 of the entire Soviet Union was 50% higher than the 1949–53 average. Given this amazing harvest, First Secretary Khruschev has taken a tour of northern Kazakhstan to hand out medals to farmers in the Virgin Lands region. That said, agriculturalists have warned that the record harvest may not be repeatable in future years and that climate and soil quality in the region will likely result in wildly shifting harvest rates in the coming years."

Loafers and truants often feel at ease; their wages and other benefits are on a par with conscientious workers. The ministries, departments, and economic managers do not create the necessary organizational and economic conditions at individual enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, and state farms for normal high-performance work. Deficiencies in planning, logistics, and production organization lead to downtime and storm work, overtime work, and failure to fulfil planned targets and obligations, negatively affecting discipline and, ultimately, the growth rate of labour productivity. Some enterprise managers, party and trade union organizations have come to terms with the low level of labour discipline, hide the facts of mismanagement, and do not take all the measures in their power to restore order in production. By Decree No. 744, while applying material and moral incentives for selfless work, it is necessary at the same time to resolutely eradicate the facts of a conciliatory attitude towards violators of labour and production discipline, to more effectively use measures of public influence, the norms of the current legislation for this purpose. Violations of labour discipline should be considered as evasion from fulfilling the obligation to work conscientiously, established by the Constitution of the USSR. Issues of the state of labour discipline and measures to strengthen it, cases of absenteeism and other violations for the appropriate public impact on violators should be constantly brought up for discussion by labour collectives, meetings of brigades, sites, farms, workshops, questions should be raised before the administration about bringing such persons to responsibility in accordance with current legislation."

There are three parties principally running; the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer; the Social Democratic Party (SPD), led by Kurt Schumacher; and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), led by Franz Blucher. However, the Communist Party of Germany remains a viable candidate in the election; being led by prominent German communist Max Reimann.\n\nThe First Main Directorate has offered a number of proposals to shift the outcome of the West German election in our favor, including sending more MGB agents to West Germany, sending financial aid to the KPD, and rigging votes in the favor of the KPD. We expect that Reimann will be on board with Soviet policy in the future, and anticipate that these election interference measures will ensure our success, while destabilizing the Western imperialist bloc.\n\nSIGNED\nViktor Abakumov\nChief of the First Directorate of the Committee for State Security"
 SOV_WGR.2.d:0 "From; G-2 Intelligence Branch, U.S. Army Europe, Allied Occupational Authorities\nTo; Provisional Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nSubject; Threats to the Security of the 1949 Federal Election\n\nRecent actions by the USSR and its satellite states have revealed a key vulnerability in the security of the Federal Republic's upcoming parliamentary elections. Recent leaks from our agents behind the Iron Curtain as well as in the Federal Republic have revealed alleged plots to shift the results of the election in the USSR's favor by rigging votes towards the Communist Party of Germany, or KPD, led by famed communist Max Reimann. Our agents have also reported a marked increase in MGB agents, as well as pro-KPD propaganda in major German cities.\n\nThe effects of this election tampering may be catastrophic; if Germany becomes communist, this will affect not only NATO and Western European security, but the balance of power globally.\n\nImmediate condemnation of election interference and arresting of MGB agents, as well as tighter election security, should guarantee a safe and democratic election for the Federal Republic.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneral Lucius D.

A new and unexpected alternative has also emerged; moving heavy industry to Central Asia, either the Kazakh SSR or Tajik SSR, both of whom have open space and resources. Where shall the industry go?"

Reports indicate the Ministry of State Security recently carried out decrees on the deportations and confiscation of properties. The numbers of Jehovah Witnesses are said to be in the thousands. The Jehovah Witnesses have long run afoul of Soviet authorities by refusing to participate in state functions, including serving in the military. For many Soviet officials, these religious beliefs represented a direct challenge to the state that had to be rooted out before it spread to other populations. The action is likely to garner some international criticism over religious persecution."

Investing in to the area will only do good."
