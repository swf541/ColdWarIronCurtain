 SOV_WGR.1.d:0 "From; First Main Directorate, Ministry of State Security\nTo; General Secretary Stalin\n\nSubject; The 1949 West German Election and Threats to Socialist Fraternal Brotherhood\n\nThe First Main Directorate, being primarily responsible for foreign intelligence, has examined and watched closely the campaign in the Federal Republic of Germany’s first election, expected to take place before the end of 1949. There are three parties principally running; the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer; the Social Democratic Party (SPD), led by Kurt Schumacher; and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), led by Franz Blucher. However, the Communist Party of Germany remains a viable candidate in the election; being led by prominent German communist Max Reimann.\n\nThe First Main Directorate has offered a number of proposals to shift the outcome of the West German election in our favor, including sending more MGB agents to West Germany, sending financial aid to the KPD, and rigging votes in the favor of the KPD. We expect that Reimann will be on board with Soviet policy in the future, and anticipate that these election interference measures will ensure our success, while destabilizing the Western imperialist bloc.\n\nSIGNED\nViktor Abakumov\nChief of the First Directorate of the Committee for State Security"
 SOV_WGR.2.d:0 "From; G-2 Intelligence Branch, U.S. Army Europe, Allied Occupational Authorities\nTo; Provisional Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nSubject; Threats to the Security of the 1949 Federal Election\n\nRecent actions by the USSR and its satellite states have revealed a key vulnerability in the security of the Federal Republic’s upcoming parliamentary elections. Recent leaks from our agents behind the Iron Curtain as well as in the Federal Republic have revealed alleged plots to shift the results of the election in the USSR’s favor by rigging votes towards the Communist Party of Germany, or KPD, led by famed communist Max Reimann. Our agents have also reported a marked increase in MGB agents, as well as pro-KPD propaganda in major German cities.\n\nThe effects of this election tampering may be catastrophic; if Germany becomes communist, this will affect not only NATO and Western European security, but the balance of power globally.\n\nImmediate condemnation of election interference and arresting of MGB agents, as well as tighter election security, should guarantee a safe and democratic election for the Federal Republic.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneral Lucius D. Clay\nCommanding General, United States Army Europe"

Siberia has been floated as an idea; but it is largely empty and the rail may be a waste. The Baltics has been proposed, but again the use has been disputed. Finally, Central Asia has been proposed, including the Kazakh SSR, Krygyz SSR, Turkmen SSR, Tajik SSR and Uzbek SSR; and would certainly help with internal mobility, as well as industrial development. Where shall the rail go?"

A new and unexpected alternative has also emerged; moving heavy industry to Central Asia, either the Kazakh SSR or Tajik SSR, both of whom have open space and resources. Where shall the industry go?"

 Soviet_Op_North.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is accused of deporting thousands of Jehovah Witnesses from the Baltic and other Eastern European areas to Siberia. Reports indicate the Ministry of State Security recently carried out decrees on the deportations and confiscation of properties. The numbers of Jehovah Witnesses are said to be in the thousands. The Jehovah Witnesses have long run afoul of Soviet authorities by refusing to participate in state functions, including serving in the military. For many Soviet officials, these religious beliefs represented a direct challenge to the state that had to be rooted out before it spread to other populations. The action is likely to garner some international criticism over religious persecution."

 SOV_Stalin_Follow_the_Percentage_Agreements_desc:0 "At the Yalta Conference, we agreed upon the limits of our sphere of influence. While we undoubtedly deserve more, we should stick to our word and not overstep our boundaries."
 SOV_Stalin_Smuggle_Arms_to_Greek_Communists_desc:0 "Civil War has broken out in Greece, and the Communist forces are fighting bravely in the face of Western oppression and intervention.

 SOV_Stalin_Suspend_Claims_on_Turkish_Lands_desc:0 "One of the issues we've been trying to press is that of the Turkish Straits, because ownership of them would give us full access to the Mediterranean and oceans beyond. However, it is outside our sphere, so we should abandon our claims."
 SOV_Stalin_Delay_Austrian_Independence_desc:0 "The Austrians and the other three Allied Powers are pressing us for Austria's independence, however we feel that the Austrians should remain under our grasp for a while longer, as they've been responsible for two world wars and we would not like a third."

 SOV_Stalin_Punish_Khrushchev_For_His_Failure_desc:0 "Khrushchev's failures as chairman of the Moscow Party have come out, and we must punish him fairly for his mistakes. This will not be tolerated."
 SOV_Stalin_Deportation_of_Jehovahs_Witnesses_desc:0 "Jehovah's Witnesses are a strange people, and should not be publicly worshiping in an atheistic state. Those individuals will be rounded up and deported where they can worship their "Jehovah" alone."
 SOV_Stalin_Dismantle_The_Jewish_Anti_Fascist_Committee_desc:0 "The JAC was originally formed under the guise of spreading the glory of Communism and the Union abroad to fellow Jewish communities, but it is now clear what they truly intend. The JAC is nothing more than a tool of the Bourgeoisie."
 SOV_Stalin_Further_Investigate_The_Mingrelian_Affair_desc:0 "In another effort to undermine Beria, we will attack his strongest supporters, the Georgian Mingrelian ethnic group. Hopefully he will finally learn his place after this."

 SOV_Stalin_Arrest_The_Treasonous_Doctors_desc:0 "Our spy system has gotten wind of a massive, disgusting, Jewish plot- the Jewish doctors of Moscow are going to poison Comrade Stalin and many other Communist Party officials! We need to act before they can carry out this horrible plan."

 STALIN_Rebuild_Ukranian_Agriculture_desc:0 "The Fascists also ruined the region's farms and food producing industries when they invaded, shipping much of the goods and supplies back to their homeland. Our people are already rationing food, so we need to get the Bread Basket of West Russia up and running again."
 STALIN_Rebuild_Destroyed_Dams_desc:0 "Many dams were destroyed during the war, damaging many villages in the area surrounding them as well as taking away the dams' ability to provide hydroelectric power. Both of those reasons are more than enough for us to start repairing dams."
 STALIN_Invest_in_the_Baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic region has suffered much in the past few decades, being assimilated into the Union less than a few years before being run over by the German War Machine, and then bearing the effects of Scorched Earth policies. Investing in to the area will only do good."

 STALIN_Repair_Mining_Pits_desc:0 "By repairing mining pits and the overall industry, we can increase our metal exports and production."
 STALIN_Eliminate_Infrastructure_Bottlenecks_desc:0 "The state of our roads and general infrastructure, while being a useful tool to slow the Nazi advance, is in a miserable state for peacetime commerce, and must be improved."
 STALIN_Increase_Cement_Production_desc:0 "Cement is a vital material for the construction of all kinds of things, from bridges and roads to buildings and fortifications, and we need to have more of it."

 STALIN_The_Soviet_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "Our military is one of the most powerful in the world- when it comes to size. However, we lag behind the West's level of research and development in several key areas, most notably jet technology and any semblance of a proper navy."
 STALIN_The_Soviet_Airforce_desc:0 "Our air force was a large part of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, as our fearless aviators crushed the Luftwaffe into submission. But, a new age of flight has come, this time powered by the Jet Engine, and we need to leap into this age fullhearted."
 STALIN_Expand_MiG_15_Production_desc:0 "Mass production of the MiG-15, one of the best jet fighters our scientist comrades have produced to date, will do wonders for the Airforce's capabilities."
 STALIN_Develop_Sakhallin_Airfields_desc:0 "The Sakhalin airfields are the far-east region of our country's largest, but are still woefully small. Expanding them will benefit us greatly."
 STALIN_Develop_the_Tu_16_desc:0 "The Tu-16 is a proposed design for a Jet Strategic Bomber by Tupolev Industries, and it looks very promising. We should authorize further research and development. "

 STALIN_The_Soviet_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army was last in combat when it smashed the Wehrmacht and brought Berlin to its knees, winning us eternal glory in the Second World War. However, we cannot rest on our laurels, as warfare is ever changing and so must we."
 STALIN_Begin_Mass_Production_of_the_T54_desc:0 "The T-54 Main Battle Tank is our latest MBT design, and is far superior to any American tank in production. Distributing it throughout our army will increase our technological edge over the West."
 STALIN_Rapid_Adoption_of_the_AK47_desc:0 "The AK-47 is the latest brilliant design to come from Mikhail Kalashnikov, and it is a beautiful assault rifle with an innovative design- yet still cheap to manufacture. We need to start producing this right away."
 STALIN_Expand_the_VDV_desc:0 "The VDV is our elite paratrooper branch of the army. While the tactics and strategies for their use are still being formed, Airborne soldiers are still good to have around."
 STALIN_Increase_Soviet_Air_Defense_Forces_desc:0 "In addition to our Aircraft, ground anti-air units are also responsible for the defense of our skies. Increasing such units will in turn increase our defense capability."
 STALIN_The_Soviet_Navy_desc:0 "The Soviet Navy is small, weak, and outdated. Without even a carrier to our name, we can never hope to match the Americans on the high seas. However, we cannot ignore our surface or submarine fleets entirely."
 STALIN_Project_30bis_desc:0 "Project 30bis is the name for a modern, top of the line destroyer which will greatly enhance our Navy's escort capabilities, and we should invest in it heavily."
 STALIN_Modernize_the_Black_Sea_Shipyards_desc:0 "While the dockyards on the Black Sea are many, they are also quite outdated and inefficient. This needs to change, and soon."
 STALIN_Study_German_Submarine_Designs_desc:0 "We captured quite a few German Submarines- and the researchers who designed them- at the end of the Second World War. By studying U-Boat designs, we can improve our own submarine fleet."
 STALIN_Ramp_Up_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "Submarines are the only chance we have at doing any damage to Western Ships or shipping if we ever come to conflict. We need to make sure our fleet is up to the task."
 
 SOV_Stalin_Establish_the_Malenkov_Khrushchev_and_Beria_Troika_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Stalin's death, a three-man advisory body, or troika, has been set up to continue the role of the government. Composed of Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev, and Lavrentiy Beria, this group is a fragile one."
 SOV_Stalin_Investigate_Berias_and_Khrushchevs_Activities_desc:0 "Beria's and Khrushchev's activities and actions in purges and other actions within the Party deserve a second look, especially as they are 2 out of the 3 most important men in the USSR."
 SOV_Stalin_Suppress_the_East_Berlin_Uprising_desc:0 "The uprising in East Berlin is a direct threat to the socialist way of life and is playing right into the hands of the Western imperialists. Their actions will not go unpunished, especially from the boot of the Soviet Union."

 SOV_Stalin_Re_Empower_the_Secretariat_desc:0 "In his later years especially, Comrade Stalin set about sidelining the Party and making our Communist State more of one man show. It is time restore the Communist Party to its rightful place in our society."
 SOV_Stalin_Send_Back_West_German_POWs_desc:0 "Having captured thousands of German soldiers towards the end of the Great Patriotic War, we really have no need for them. This would be a gesture of good faith to the West, that they will get back their prisoners."
 SOV_Stalin_Extend_the_Government_Powers_desc:0 "In addition to shunting the to Party to the side, Stalin also shut down the Party apparatus, further decreasing its importance and influence. We need to reactivate it to strengthen the Party."

 SOV_Stalin_Establish_the_KGB_desc:0 "The KGB - Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti - which translates to 'Committee for State Security' in English, is our answer to the CIA. It will seek to spread our interests and ideologies far and wide, crack down on internal dissidents, and conversely sow dissent in our enemies' lands."
 SOV_Stalin_Establish_A_New_Diplomatic_Stance_desc:0 "Our new diplomatic stance will appear to the west as a softer one, perhaps turning the Iron Curtain into a chain-link fence. But appearances are deceiving. We may not be sending forces of our own, but we will still be fighting for Communism across the globe."
 SOV_Stalin_Clear_Out_the_Gulags_desc:0 "Another unfortunate byproduct of Stalin's paranoia is an unbelievable amount of political prisoners, stuffed in an overflowing and overwhelmed Gulag System. Cleaning it out will streamline our bureaucracy, lessen our expenses, and gain our people's trust."
 SOV_Stalin_Investigate_the_Stalin_Purges_desc:0 "The Leningrad Affair was a dirty incident, prompted by a paranoid and aging leader suspicious of everyone in the Union of conspiring to kill him. We need to put it behind us and distance ourselves from it."
 SOV_Stalin_Pressure_Scientists_for_the_Hydrogen_Bomb_desc:0 "If the Americans are to take our threats seriously, we need to be able to deal out the same damage they can. And to do that, we need a hydrogen bomb, the latest development in nuclear weapons technology."
 SOV_Stalin_Reduce_Criminal_Sentences_desc:0 "Under Stalin, people received the harshest punishments for the smallest crimes. It lowered our people's moral and caused us to lose their trust. We need to show that we are working towards true justice, whether or not we actually intend to have it."
 SOV_Stalin_Begin_the_Virgin_Lands_Campaign_desc:0 "The Virgin Lands Campaign aims to utilize previous untouched lands for agriculture and farms. This will increase our food production capabilities and food storage capacity."
 SOV_Stalin_Execute_Viktor_Abakumov_desc:0 "Viktor Abakumov is in charge of SMERSH, a deputy of Beria's and his head purger. Abakumov should be purged, just like he did to hundreds if not thousands of innocents."
 SOV_Stalin_Push_for_Malenkovs_Resignation_desc:0 "Malenkov has not ever played a major threat to the duumvirate, enough to make an effect on influence, but was still allied with Beria enough that we should force him to step down peacefully."

 SOV_Stalin_Prepare_A_Mass_Release_Plan_desc:0 "However ironic it might be, preparing a mass release plan for our labor camps and prisons will ensure that we know what we’re doing when that comes into effect."
 SOV_Stalin_Reform_the_Secret_Services_desc:0 "Being in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Beria recognizes the need for reform, something he could not accomplish under Comrade Stalin. Now that he is gone, we can advance to a new age of internal security."
 SOV_Stalin_Execute_Bulganin_desc:0 "Minister of National Defense Nikolai Bulganin is known to be an ally of Khrushchev, the reformer. Being the highest-ranking Red Army member in the government, he cannot remain at his post."

 SOV_Stalin_Raise_Agricultural_Prices_desc:0 "Crop prices must be increased to keep up with supply and demand."
 SOV_Stalin_Reduce_Surplus_Equipment_Stockpiles_desc:0 "Surplus equipment is just collecting dust in our warehouses, and perhaps putting it to use, or giving it to others, will reduce the amount of goods we have to store."
 SOV_Stalin_Abolish_Internal_Passports_desc:0 "Internal passports in our country just add another layer of worry and uselessness to the travel process around the Union. Abolishing them will allow greater freedom of movement within our borders."

 SOV_Stalin_Soften_Quotas_For_the_State_Farms_desc:0 "The state farms' quotas have always been high, never enough for them to actually make it. In order to reflect actual goals, quota amount will be lessened."
 SOV_Stalin_Fragment_the_Larger_Farms_desc:0 "The larger state farms have turned unwieldly and too hard to deal with. Fragmenting these farms into smaller units will ease our problems."
 
 SOV_Stalin_Establish_the_Malenkov_Pervukhinn_and_Saburov_Advisory_Body_desc:0 "Now that Comrade Stalin has made it through the plot against his life, we shall establish a special advisory group to support his rule, including Georgy Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Mikhail Pervukhinn, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of Gosplan; and Maksim Saburov, also First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of Gosplan and the State Planning Committee. "

This is why its imperative to move from Stalin's shadow while embracing the ideas of Lenin of bringing every able hand into the grace of the Communist Party, building unity in the fine arts of Union, by allowing Socialist Realism to diverge from the Cult of Personality and walk on its own by silently and slowly getting Stalin's cult removed from the main pedestal of attention of the Party while the Politburo deliberate the future of the nation's artistic soul."

However, many members of the Party and the institutions in charge of economic planning both, internationally and nationally, have seen the COMECON as a way to subtract valuable resources from the Soviet Union without receiving any real profit in return. A deep analysis of the organization will allow Kaganovich's administration to find a new way to utilize this diplomatic tool in a manner in which every member, including the Soviet Union, could find it as a beneficial organization far beyond a simple formality from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to justify sending aid to Communist states."

Stalin promoted pragmatism within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the objective of increasing the Soviet Union's relations with the West and improving the international position of the Soviet Union as a diplomatic state. However, the constant attacks from the West against comrades all around the world has demonstrated that no matter the stand of the Soviet government, they will conspire against the Communist movement worldwide. With this in mind, reorganizing the Komintern will allow Communist organizations around the world to obtain sufficient intelligence and aid to efficiently counteract against the many aggressions that the United States and its allies have done against the proletariat and its struggle to organize itself against the bourgeoisie.@Polaracewe need english as first lang"
