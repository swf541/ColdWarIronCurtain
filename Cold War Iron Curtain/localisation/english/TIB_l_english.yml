TIB_KMT_50s:0 "Kuomintang Tibet Focus Tree"

POLITICS_TENZIN_GYATSO_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gAfter the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new incarnation when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old. Tenzin was only a toddler when the Qinghai warlord Ma Bufang was diplomatically bribing the Lhasa government in order for them to return to Tibet. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Kashag, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939. After his enthronement, he would spend most of his childhood between the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, his summer residence. After the emergence of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it is uncertain what his future role in Tibet will look like if the Kuomintang decides to invade Tibet.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the Xinhai Revolution, the region of Tibet declared independence from the newly founded Republic of China. For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai. The Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek has already taken advantage of Tibetan negligence to expand its reach into the territory. In 1941, Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which shall be re-integrated into China following the conclusion of World War II.§!"
