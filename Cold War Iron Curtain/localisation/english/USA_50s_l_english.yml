amendment_22.1.d:0 "The Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States constitution limits the number of terms an individual can serve as president to two. Interest in the amendment rose after Franklin Roosevelt was elected four times for the office. Supporters of the amendment argue allowing unlimited terms could weaken democracy and strays away from the tradition of two terms established by George Washington. The amendment was passed in February 1947 and the state ratification process is ongoing. There is pressure for state legislatures to take up the amendment more quickly. The President can either support the process or urge state legislatures to delay ratification to prevent the amendment achieving the three-fourths majority required of state legislatures. If a majority is not reached by February 1954, the amendment will fail."
amendment_22.2.d:0 "Four years after being passed by Congress, the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution, the required number of state legislatures have adopted the amendment. The constitutional requirements were all met comfortably within the seven year time limit given by Congress to the state legislatures. Political leaders on both sides of the aisle are praising the President for not interfering with the process. The new amendment will limit the number of terms an individual can serve as president to only two. Many feel this amendment restores balance between the executive and legislative branches of government. Despite general approval, there are some Americans who feel the new amendment is unnecessary and may cost the American people long-term leadership from an exceptional President, such as Franklin Roosevelt."
amendment_22.3.d:0 "The President started a political storm following recent comments with regards to the ratification process for the Twenty-Second Amendment. The amendment would limit an individual to only two terms as President. In his remarks, the President called the amendment a kneejerk reaction to the immediate post-Roosevelt era, noting the American people can and should be trusted to elect the right man for the job no matter the circumstances or how many terms an individual has served. He has called on political leaders at the state level to reject the amendment. Congressional leaders were quick to condemn the President for his interference in the matter and reports indicate the White House is also telling state legislatures to delay voting on the amendment so the seven year limit given by Congress expires."
amendment_22.4.d:0 "The recent remarks by the President against the Twenty-Second Amendment are succeeding, as state legislatures are either setting up rejection votes or are tabling discussion on the amendment indefinitely. The White House likely cannot ensure enough states will reject the amendment but delaying tactics can ensure the required three-fourth majority of state legislatures approving an amendment is not reached. This could put the amendment in a strange political limbo but will keep it from becoming law. The President strongly believes limiting presidential terms will only leave the United States vulnerable in the event of future crisis."
amendment_22.5.d:0 "Defiant political leaders in state legislatures across the United States are defying a recent call from the White House to halt adoption of the Twenty-Second Amendment. Enough state legislatures have agreed to not delay or reject the amendment that the President will have to accept its ratification as inevitable. It appears many leaders were taken aback by the White House and feared their rejection of the amendment would upset the national balance of power. A spokesperson for the White House stated the President made his opinion known but did not demand state legislatures obey his directives as opponents are alleging."
amendment_22.6.d:0 "Opponents of the President are having a field day over his failed effort to halt ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment. Although the President stated he wished extra terms not for himself but for future office holders, opponents quickly painted the effort as a naked attempt to govern longer. Newspapers are full of editorials calling the continued ratification process as a victory for democracy. The President had gambled a lot of his political capital to stop the amendment, and his failure has led backlash. White House opponents are greatly enjoying their victory lap."
amendment_22.7.d:0 "The Twenty-Second Amendment, despite being passed by Congress and a majority of states, failed to achieve enough ratification votes within the seven-year time limit provided by Congress. Amendments require a three-fourth majority of state legislatures to ratify the amendment within the time limit specified. During the state ratification phase, the White House at the time openly campaigned for the amendment to not be passed or brought to a vote. They felt term limits for the presidency were arbitrary and took options away from the American people. Supporters of the Amendment are condemning the failure of its adoption, noting the amendment would protect democracy and restore balance between the three branches of government."

amendment_22.8.d:0 "The Twenty-Second Amendment limits an individual for only two terms. This arbitrary limit prevents the American people from selecting the best leader if needed and must be repelled. However, doing so will require a lot of political capital and public support, as the opposition can easily manipulate the argument as an effort by the White House to expand its own power."
amendment_22.9.d:0 "After securing enough political capital and setting up a strong environment for change, the President has successfully overseen the repeal of the Twenty-Second amendment. The amendment limits individuals to only two terms as president. However, the President successfully managed to garner the two-thirds majority required for both houses of Congress to pass a new amendment repealing it. The three-fourth majority of state legislatures required to adopt the amendment are expected to pass their approval in the coming weeks. This is a major victory for the White House but has left it exposed to criticism from opponents who claim the amendment prevents an individual from monopolizing executive power."
amendment_22.10.d:0 "The recent presidential effort to secure enough Congressional and state level support to repeal the twenty-second amendment has failed. The White House failed to convince enough political leaders that the amendment, which gives presidential term limits, is unnecessary and a hinderance for the democratic rights of citizens. Noted constitutional legal experts long warned the President his effort faced daunting odds and they were proven correct. Although the effort initially seemed to have enough support, public backlash fueled by political opponents ensured the effort failed."
amendment_22.11.d:0 "The Twenty-Second Amendment failed to achieve the three-fourths majority among state legislatures. At the time there was a lot of political debate on the issue and a lack of consensus. As a result, despite a majority of states adopting the amendment, not enough ratified it by the time the Congressional deadline ended. The President and Congressional allies could initiate a new effort to provide a new timeline and complete the ratification process."
amendment_22.12.d:0 "The President and senior Congressional allies met to congratulate each other following the formal adoption of the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution. The amendment, which limits an individual to two terms max for the presidency, had been stalled for a number of years. However, the President and his allies were able to revive the ratification process and ensure the three-fourth majority threshold with regards to state legislatures was reached. The President is being praised for his political savvy in negotiating this difficult constitutional crisis."
amendment_22.13.d:0 "In an embarrassing setback for the President and his allies, efforts to complete the ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment has stalled once again. After weeks of effort, it is clear that enough state legislatures are refusing to take up the amendment, ensuring the three-fourth majority cannot be reached. The effort to revive the amendment required a great deal of political capital and cooperation between the White House and Congress. Newspapers are openly questioning the political credibility of the President and entertainment shows are full of jokes regarding a President who cannot even limit his own terms."

nixon.1960.d:0 "President Richard Nixon took time to condemn the southern Democrats, called Dixiecrats, for their extreme segregationist stance and resistance to civil rights. The President noted these politicians have interfered with Supreme Court rulings and federal statutes across the south. The speech by the President is being praised by civil rights activists. However, opponents to the President accuse him of seeking to exploit the current situation in the South in order to rally support for the Republican Party. Supporters to the President dismiss this criticism and insist he is simply laying the framework for future civil rights legislation."
Operation_Vulture.1.d:0 "The United States military announced the initiation of combat operations against anti-French communist Viet Minh forces in French Indochina. American bombers from nearby airfields are targeting key Viet Minh strongpoints as other combat units move into the country. The United States believes the Viet Minh represents a major threat to regional security and the safety of the Vietnamese people. The French government welcomes the support and claims it will soon be able to restore security in Vietnam and reach an honorable resolution to the conflict. The global response is expected to be especially negative from post-colonial states who will see the action as the United States propping up European imperialism."
