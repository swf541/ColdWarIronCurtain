 MLA_OTL.1.t:0 "Elimination of the British Colonial Tyrant Henry Gurney"
 MLA_OTL.1.d:0 "In a triumphant strike against the forces of colonial oppression, the courageous guerrillas of our Malayan Communist Party successfully ambushed and eliminated the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, in a decisive battle north of Kuala Lumpur. Displaying unparalleled bravery and tactical brilliance, the guerrillas overwhelmed the colonial convoy, striking fear into the heart of the imperialist regime. Gurney, the symbol of British tyranny, met his end as he staggered helplessly towards the ambush site, a testament to the unstoppable force of the people's army. This victory marks a significant blow to the colonial oppressors and strengthens the resolve of the Malayan people in their righteous struggle for liberation. The flames of revolution burn brighter than ever as the colonial empire is crumbling."
 MLA_OTL.2.t:0 "Tragic Loss of High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney"
 MLA_OTL.2.d:0 "In a devastating turn of events, High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney was tragically killed during an ambush by Malayan Communist Party guerrillas while traveling north of Kuala Lumpur. Despite being wounded, Gurney heroically exited his vehicle to protect his wife and private secretary, but was fatally struck by enemy fire. His convoy, overwhelmed by the sudden attack, was unable to save him, and his loyal chauffeur also lost his life. Lady Gurney, emerging from the wreckage, was heartbroken to find her husband lying lifeless in a roadside ditch. Reinforcements arrived too late to prevent this terrible loss, leaving both the British and Malayan communities in mourning."
 MLA_OTL.3.t:0 "The Baling Talks"
 MLA_OTL.3.d:0 "On December 28, 1955, the Baling Talks took place in an English school in Baling, Malaysia. This significant meeting brought together leaders from both the rebellious Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and our Commonwealth forces in an attempt to negotiate a peace treaty during the Malayan Emergency. Representing the MCP were Chairman Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tien, while our side was represented by Malayan PM Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng-Lock, and David Saul Marshall. The Meeting started with countless of radical demands from Chin Peng as he demanded the Malayan government to legalizing and recognized MCP's past struggles and contribution to the defeat of Japanese forces in 1945 to not retaliate against all MCP's members."
 MLA_OTL.4.t:0 "The Baling Talks"
 MLA_OTL.4.d:0 "On December 28, 1955, the Baling Talks took place in an English school in Baling, Malaysia. This significant meeting brought together leaders from both of our glorious Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and colonial British forces in an attempt to negotiate a peace treaty and an end for our current ongoing Resistance War against British Imperialism . Representing our side were Comrade Chairman Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tien, while the colonial's side was represented by colonial PM Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng-Lock, and David Saul Marshall. The Meeting started with countless of requests from comrade Chin Peng as we demanded nothing but peace and revolutionary changes for our Malayan workers and people."

 MLA_Victory.1.t:0 "The Colonial Dogs Retreat to Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.1.d:0 "In a triumphant advance of our revolutionary Malayan Liberation Army under command of Comrade Chin Peng, the forces of British imperialists have been driven out of Kuala Lumpur and the Malayan mainland, retreating in desperation to their final colonial stronghold, Singapore. Under the fearless struggle of the revolutionized people, the total liberation of Malaya is nearly complete, signaling the imminent collapse of British colonial rule in Southeast Asia."
 MLA_Victory.2.t:0 "Emergency Evacuation to Singapore Issued"
 MLA_Victory.2.d:0 "In a significant setback, Joint British and Malayan forces under Field Marshal Gerald Templer have been forced to retreat to Singapore following the shocking fall of Kuala Lumpur and the mainland to the advancing communist Malayan Liberation Army, led by Chin Peng. The situation is dire as the remaining colonial and national government forces consolidate in Singapore, the last stronghold in Southeast Asia. The rapid advance of the communist forces has raised deep concerns about the future stability of the region and the potential collapse of British and Malayan control in this critical area."
 MLA_Victory.3.t:0 "The 'Malayan National Liberation Army' Has Taken Over Singapore!"
 MLA_Victory.3.d:0 "Tragically, despite the British and the Malayan army best attempt at defending Singapore from the MLA, they failed to prevent the communist from taking over. With the Communists controlling Singapore, many have fled to escape persecution from the new communist government. Many officials also hope to set up a Malayan government in exile elsewhere in hope to reclaim Malaya from the Communists one day, while the British have expressed interests in reestablishing the White Rajah to power in Sarawak."
 MLA_Victory.4.t:0 "Establishing a Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.4.d:0 "In a last-ditch effort to maintain a loyal Malayan state within the Commonwealth, the British government approved the relocation and establishment of the Malayan-in-Exile Government on the Coco and Christmas Islands, now renamed Pulau Kokos and Pulau Krismas. Following the fall of mainland Malaya to the Communist Party of Malaya under Chin Peng. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman has evacuated to Pulau Krismas, leading the exiled government. This move, supported by Britain, aims to preserve a pro-Commonwealth presence in the region and is seen as a strategic attempt to regroup and maintain influence in Southeast Asia amidst the rising tide of communist control."
 MLA_Victory.5.t:0 "Establishment of the Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.5.d:0 "The Malayan Communist Party, under the leadership of comrade Chin Peng, has strongly condemned the establishment of the so-called Malayan-in-Exile Government on the Coco and Christmas Islands. Chin Peng denounced this desperate move by the British and their puppet, Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the latest attempt to cling to power after their resounding defeat on the mainland.\n\nThe Party criticized the miserable living conditions and incompetence of Tunku Abdul Rahman's failed regime, predicting that it's only a matter of time before the Malayan people rise up against this artificial, colonial creation."
 MLA_Victory.6.t:0 "British Imperialists Resurrect Colonial Rule in Sarawak"
 MLA_Victory.6.d:0 "In a desperate bid to cling to power in Southeast Asia, the British Empire has revived the outdated \"Dominion of Sarawak\" under the White Rajah, Vyner Brooke. This colonial relic, backed by British funding, is their latest ploy to halt the inevitable march of communist liberation in the region.\n\nThe Reactionary Dog, Templer, fleeing from his defeat in Singapore, has been appointed as the first Chief of Staff of the Sarawak Rangers. This reactionary force is intended to serve as a last barrier against our victorious Army led by our Comrade Chin Peng.\n\nThis shameless act reveals the imperialists' fear of losing control, but their efforts will be in vain."
 MLA_Victory.7.t:0 "The Rebirth of Sarawak"
 MLA_Victory.7.d:0 "In a decisive move to ensure peace and stability in Southeast Asia, the Commonwealth and London has supported the re-establishment of the Dominion of Sarawak under the leadership of our White Rajah, Vyner Brooke. This dominion shall stand as a symbol of hope and resistance against the growing red tide of evil in the region.\n\nField Marshal Templer, a seasoned leader recently evacuated from Singapore, has been appointed as the first Chief of Staff of the Sarawak Rangers. This newly formed military force is dedicated to safeguarding the people of Sarawak and securing the region from further unrest.\n\nThe revival of Sarawak reflects the perpetual partnership between the United Kingdom and her allies in Southeast Asia. "

 MLA_PRC.1.t:0 "Proclamation of the People's Democratic Union of Nanyang"
 MLA_PRC.1.d:0 "In a historic triumph, Comrade Chin Peng and the Malayan Communist Party proudly declare our unwavering allegiance to Beijing and the Communist Party of China. With the fall of colonial Malaya, we now march forward to realize the dream of the Nanyang Union — a powerful Socialist Union in Southeast Asia uniting Chinese, Malays, and all oppressed races under one revolutionary banner.\n\nGuided by Beijing's righteous policies, the Nanyang Union will dismantle the chains of colonialism and capitalism, replacing them with a unified, just society for all. The dawn of a new era is upon us, where the peoples of Southeast Asia will finally stand together in solidarity, free from the yoke of imperialist exploitation."
 MLA_PRC.2.t:0 "The Nanyang Situation"
 MLA_PRC.2.d:0 "The British authorities view the Malayan Communist Party's recent declaration of allegiance to Beijing and their plans to establish a so-called \"Nanyang Union\" as an exercise in utter folly. The idea of creating a Socialist Union in Southeast Asia, uniting Chinese, Malays, and other ethnic groups under one roof, is seen as nothing short of madness.\n\nBritish officials warn that this ill-conceived scheme is not only unrealistic but also dangerously inflammatory. Far from achieving solidarity, such a move is more likely to ignite a brutal race war between Malays and Chinese, further destabilizing the region. The notion that these diverse and historically divided communities would come together under a single communist banner is viewed as a pipe dream, destined to fail and cause immense suffering in its wake."

 MLA_OTL.0.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Assassination of High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney"
 MLA_OTL.0.d:0 "On a routine journey north of Kuala Lumpur in Fraser's Hill, Pahang, Malayan High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney's convoy was ambushed by 38 Malayan Communist Party guerrillas. Gurney, despite being wounded, exited his vehicle to protect and draw fire away from his wife and private secretary. The insurgents targeted him, fatally wounding Gurney. His convoy was heavily damaged, and his chauffeur was killed. After a brief firefight, the guerrillas withdrew, leaving Lady Gurney to discover her husband's body in a roadside ditch. Reinforcements arrived 20 minutes later, but it was too late. The Malayan Communist National Liberation Army and their leader Chin Peng have claimed responsibility for the latest killing."

 MLA_OTL.100.d:0 "The much-anticipated Baling Talks, held on December 28, 1955, in the small town of Baling, have ended in failure, dashing hopes for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Malaya. The negotiations, which brought together leaders of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), including Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tien, and representatives of the British-Malayan Union forces, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng-Lock, and David Saul Marshall, failed to reach an agreement.\n\nDespite initial optimism, the talks broke down over irreconcilable differences. The MCP's demands for political recognition and participation were rejected by the Commonwealth representatives, who insisted on the unconditional disarmament of communist forces. The impasse led to the collapse of the talks, leaving the conflict unresolved.\n\nThe failure of the Baling Talks has renewed fears of continued violence and instability in Malaya. With no peace treaty in sight, the region remains on edge, and the conflict is expected to escalate without a foreseen-able ending…"
 MLA_OTL.200.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Baling Peace Treaty Secures Ceasefire in Malaya" 
 MLA_OTL.200.d:0 "In a historic turn of events, the Baling Talks, held on December 28, 1955, between British-Malayan Union forces and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), have culminated in a successful peace treaty. The negotiations, which took place in the town of Baling, were attended by MCP leaders Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tien, alongside representatives of the Commonwealth forces, including Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng-Lock, and David Saul Marshall.\n\nThe Baling Peace Treaty, as it is now known, has established a ceasefire between the warring factions, marking a significant step towards ending the violent conflict that has plagued Malaya. The agreement outlines terms for disarmament, political participation, and the gradual reintegration of communists into Malayan society.\n\nThis landmark treaty is seen as a victory for diplomacy and a hopeful sign for lasting peace in the region. Both sides have expressed cautious optimism that the ceasefire will pave the way for a stable and prosperous future for Malaya. The international community has welcomed the treaty, viewing it as a key development in the broader struggle for independence and stability in Southeast Asia."

 MLA_Victory.0.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Britain Evacuates to the City of Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.0.d:0 "In a significant development in Southeast Asia, the British Army and Malayan Armed Forces, led by Field Marshal Gerald Temple, have retreated to Singapore following the fall of Kuala Lumpur and the Malayan mainland to the Malayan Liberation Army under Communist leader Chin Peng. This retreat marks a critical turning point in the Malayan Emergency, as the communist forces gain control over key territories. The fall of Kuala Lumpur has heightened concerns about the stability of the region, with Singapore now serving as the last stronghold of British and Commonwealth forces in the face of the growing communist victory. The situation remains tense as both sides prepare for the next phase of the conflict."
 MLA_Victory.100.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]The Malayan Government in Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.100.d:0 "The loss of Malaya and the retreat of the Malayan government to Singapore has been a huge blow to the British and its western allies in Southeast Asia as it spells another domino collapsing on Malaya. Many Malays had also fled their home from Malaya to avoid persecution from the Communist forces and crowded among the City of Singapore. The influx of Malays in Singapore has led to ethnic tension rising between Malays and Chinese residents and only time will tell whether the Communist would take advantage of this chaos."
 MLA_Victory.200.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]The Raj of Sarawak Restored!"
 MLA_Victory.200.d:0 "In a strategic move to counter the rising threat of communism in Southeast Asia following the fall of Malaya to Chin Peng's Malaysian Liberation Army, the White Rajah of Sarawak, Rajah Vyner Brooke of the Brooke Dynasty, has re-established the Dominion of Sarawak. This new political entity, formed with the sponsorship of the British government, aims to serve as a final deterrence against the spread of communism in the region.\n\nAs part of this effort, Field Marshal Templer, who recently fled Singapore, has been appointed as the first Chief of Staff of the Sarawak Rangers, the military force tasked with defending Sarawak against potential communist incursions. The re-establishment of the Raj of Sarawak underscores the British Empire's commitment to maintaining a foothold in Southeast Asia, amidst growing instability and the communist victories on the Malayan mainland."

 MLA_PRC.0.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Chin Peng Declares the Nanyang Union"
 MLA_PRC.0.d:0 "Following their decisive victory in mainland Malaya, Chin Peng and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP)have formally declared their unwavering allegiance to Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China (CPC). In a bold proclamation, was the declaration of the revival of the \"Nanyang Union\", an ambitious concept originally proposed by the CPC in the 1920s. This envisioned a Socialist Union in Southeast Asia that would unite Chinese, Malays, and other ethnic groups under a single communist framework. Chin Peng hailed this as a blueprint for achieving true revolutionary unity in the region, stating that the Nanyang Union would eradicate colonial and capitalist influences, replacing them with a harmonious socialist society.\n\nThe MCP's alignment with Beijing signals a deeper integration of Southeast Asia into the broader communist bloc, raising concerns among neighboring governments and Western powers about the expanding influence of China in the region. The announcement has also intensified fears of further communist insurgencies across Southeast Asia, particularly in territories still under colonial or non-communist control."

However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
