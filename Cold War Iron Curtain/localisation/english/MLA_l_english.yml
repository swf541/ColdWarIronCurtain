 MLA_Victory.1_desc:0 "Tragically, despite the British and the Malayan army best attempt at defending Malaya from the MLA, they failed to prevent the Communist from taking over Malaya. With the Communists controlling Malaya, many have fled to escape persecution from the new Communist government. Many officials also hope to set up a Malayan government in exile elsewhere in hope to reclaim Malaya from the Communists one day, while the British have expressed interests in reestablishing the White Rajah to power in Sarawak."
 MLA_Victory.2:0 "The Plan to Establish a Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.2_desc:0 "With the defeat in Malaya to the Communist force, we have decided to help the Malayan setting up a government in exile in the islands not under Communist control. We have also decided to tighten security to ensure that no Communist infiltrators could subverse any attempts at preventing our return to Malaya."
 MLA_Victory.3:0 "Establishment of the Malayan Government in Exile"
 MLA_Victory.3_desc:0 "Recently, we have received news that the British have set up a government in exile for the former Malayan government in Singapore. While this is only a temporary setback to our plan to unify Malaya, we still have time to prepare for our liberation of Singapore. We will now begin our liberation of Singapore by sending infiltrators to contact any Communist cells there to undermine the British garrison."
 MLA_Victory.4:0 "Establishment of the New Domains"
 MLA_Victory.4_desc:0 "After our victory in Singapore, we have received news that the British have set up puppet states in Borneo such as the White Rajah of Sarawak, the Dominion of Borneo and the Kingdom of Brunei. To us, these states are nothing more than the continuation of British colonialism in Southeast Asia. We must continue our liberation of Borneo just as we did in Malaya and Singapore by aiding our comrades in Borneo."
 MLA_Victory.5:0 "The Capture of Gerald Templar & Tunku Abdul Rahman"
 MLA_Victory.5_desc:0 "Great news! We have captured Gerald Templar and Tunku Abdul Rahman, who were responsible for the massacres of our comrades. This is a huge blow to the British considering that they put Templar in charge of the atrocities against our comrades. We will give him the treatment he deserves for killing our comrades."

#### Malayan Emergency News Events ####

 MLA_Victory.0:0 "Britain Evacuates to the City of Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.0_desc:0 "With Malaya fallen to the Malayan National Liberation Army, the British began evacuating as many Malayan official and personnel to Singapore. While this is a setback to British control in Malaya, the Malayan government promise to free Malaya from the Communist forces once and for all."
 MLA_Victory.100:0 "The Malayan Government in Singapore"
 MLA_Victory.100_desc:0 "The loss of Malaya and the retreat of the Malayan government to Singapore has been a huge blow to the British and its western allies in Southeast Asia as it spells another domino collapsing on Malaya. Many Malays had also fled their home from Malaya to avoid persecution from the Communist forces and crowded among the City of Singapore. The influx of Malays in Singapore has led to ethnic tension rising between Malays and Chinese residents and only time will tell whether the Communist would take advantage of this chaos."
 MLA_Victory.200:0 "The Raj of Sarawak restored!"
 MLA_Victory.200_desc:0 "With the Federation of Malaya falling to the Communists, Britain has begun restoring the old Raj of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke to his throne in Sarawak in an attempt to stop Borneo from the same fate as Malaya from falling under communism. While the restoration of the Raj of Sarawak is celebrated by Britain, her allies, and the Sarawakian natives as another ally to stop the dominoes from falling, many also criticize the move as continuing an “ Evil “ colonial minority regime in South East Asia. The White Rajah Vyner has declared that the move is temporary and he will collaborate with the Native’s Negri Council to decide a long-term future for the Country. Only time will tell whether the White Rajahs will hold their domain in Sarawak or Sarawak will fall just like Malaya."

In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS.

The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes.

In total 20 nations used the MiG-17, spanning Africa, Europe and Asia. Its first combat deployment was in 1958, when PRC MiGs clashed with Nationalist Chinese F-86 Sabres over the Taiwan Strait. However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war. The MiG-17 was generally decommissioned in the 1970's, while it still remains in limited service in some African nations and North Korea."

It achieved a more robust multi-role capability with enhanced use of air-to-air and air-to-ground high-precision weapons. It also featured a considerably increased combat range, owing to an increase in its internal fuel capacity. A few changes took place during the aircraft's development. The redesigned airframe was constructed from a lightweight Aluminium-lithium alloy to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio. The air intake ramps' geometry was revised, the upper intake louvers were removed to make way for more fuel in the LERXs, mesh screens introduced to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) and inlet dimensions were enlarged for higher airflow."
