 combat_support:0 "Combat Support"
 combat_support_desc:0 "Combat support companies are companies that serve a semi-direct role in combat. While not behind the lines, they serve roles that usually involve combat itself but not direct frontline combat. Combat support companies must be prepared to take part in fighting but optimally do not directly engage. Before combat support companies can be developed, the basic equipment kits and durable sets must be developed so these companies can be ready to support frontline troops."
 combat_service_support:0 "Combat Service Support"
 combat_service_support_desc:0 "Combat service companies are companies that do not play any direct role in combat and are not fit for fighting. They remain far behind the lines and do not take direct or indirect roles in the fighting itself. Although this does not mean that they do not need to be near the front as medical companies still need to be available to provide medical attention to wounded soldiers and maintenance companies can run field repairs. Before combat service companies can be developed, the foundations for portable field structures such as tents, trailers, and van components must be developed."

 #RECON

 tech_recon:0 "Recon I: Scouts"
 tech_recon_desc:0 "Scouts are the simplest form of recon operative. The scout's job is to find enemy positions and information about the enemy's strength and numbers, then relay those back to allied forces. Scouts patrol regions and obtain knowledge of enemy positions. Scouts require simple communications equipment, optics, and lightweight gear."
 tech_recon2:0 "Recon II: Observers"
 tech_recon2_desc:0 "Observers are recon units that maintain advanced positions in active combat. Observers maintain knowledge of enemy units and provide important details of enemy attacks, movements, and positions so that allies can take appropriate measures and react to them. Observers need more expensive communications equipment and lightweight combat equipment to defend themselves."
 tech_recon3:0 "Recon III: Spotters"
 tech_recon3_desc:0 "Spotters are observers that are assigned to specific combat elements and provide details on potential targets in active battle. Spotters acquire targets and relay that information to their assigned elements to engage or consider engaging. Spotters require better communications, optics, and coordinate systems to relay precise details on enemy locations."
 tech_recon4:0 "Recon IV: Recce Elite"
 tech_recon4_desc:0 "Recon forces are important elements in an army. Because of their nature, it is important to preserve their lives and survivability in combat. By introducing a more advanced combat training and survival regimen, recon forces can survive for longer periods of time and become resistant to ambushes and abrupt strikes."
 tech_recon5:0 "Recon V: Modern Skirmishers"
 tech_recon5_desc:0 "Skirmishers are an advanced form of scout. Historically, skirmishers have been light infantry that act as vanguards to allied positions, harass enemies, and screen enemy positions. In modern combat, many of these skirmishers have been phased out or have minimal survivability. By developing weapons and systems that can provide harassing fire and escape difficult situations, the skirmisher role can be fulfilled in modern combat."
 tech_recon6:0 "Recon VI: Field Spies"
 tech_recon6_desc:0 "Field spies are army espionage elements that disguise themselves as enemy units or civilians in order to evade detection. They do not operate as part of an intelligence agency but rather as part of an army, relaying active locations to an enemy, usually in urban warfare where it is easiest for them to be in position. Field spies require concealable and covert equipment such as compact radios or modified civilian phones in order to operate."
 tech_recon7:0 "Recon VII: Deep-Wire Recon"
 tech_recon7_desc:0 "Deep Wire Recon is a highly advanced operation in which recon elements position themselves far beyond enemy lines in order to relay information. These sorts of deep infiltration tactics require massive levels of trial in order to develop and typically require units to conceal themselves and let the enemy pass. The equipment and camouflaging techniques as well as infiltration tactics are difficult to create but are extremely worthwhile as they can provide the most in-depth information that cannot be acquired by conventional recon elements."
 
 #MECH RECON
 
 tech_mech_recon:0 "Mechanized Recon I: Motorized Scouts"
 tech_mech_recon_desc:0 "Scouts are the simplest form of recon operative. The scout's job is to find enemy positions and information about the enemy's strength and numbers, then relay those back to allied forces. Scouts patrol regions and obtain knowledge of enemy positions. Scouts require simple communications equipment, optics, and lightweight gear. Motorized scouts use fast moving, decently armored vehicles to patrol areas more quickly."
 tech_mech_recon2:0 "Mechanized Recon II: Forward Observers"
 tech_mech_recon2_desc:0 "Observers are recon units that maintain advanced positions in active combat. Observers maintain knowledge of enemy units and provide important details of enemy attacks, movements, and positions so that allies can take appropriate measures and react to them. Observers need more expensive communications equipment and lightweight combat equipment to defend themselves. Forward Observers use equipment such as helicopters or recon vehicles to maintain better visuals."
 tech_mech_recon3:0 "Mechanized Recon III: Mechanized Spotters"
 tech_mech_recon3_desc:0 "Spotters are observers that are assigned to specific combat elements and provide details on potential targets in active battle. Spotters acquire targets and relay that information to their assigned elements to engage or consider engaging. Spotters require better communications, optics, and coordinate systems to relay precise details on enemy locations. Mechanized spotters use heavily armored vehicles with strong optics to acquire targets."
 tech_mech_recon4:0 "Mechanized Recon IV: Recce Mobile Task Elite"
 tech_mech_recon4_desc:0 "Recon forces are important elements in an army. Because of their nature, it is important to preserve their lives and survivability in combat. By introducing a more advanced combat training and survival regimen, recon forces can survive for longer periods of time and become resistant to ambushes and abrupt strikes. Developing expensive high-end scout vehicles can further aid in the survivability of scouts."
 tech_mech_recon5:0 "Mechanized Recon V: Modern Advanced Skirmishers"
 tech_mech_recon5_desc:0 "Skirmishers are an advanced form of scout. Historically, skirmishers have been light infantry that act as vanguards to allied positions, harass enemies, and screen enemy positions. In modern combat, many of these skirmishers have been phased out or have minimal survivability. By developing weapons and systems that can provide harassing fire and escape difficult situations, the skirmisher role can be fulfilled in modern combat. Providing scout tanks with smoke screens and modern chaff dispensers can greatly aid in their ability to harass the enemy and survive returning fire."
 tech_mech_recon6:0 "Mechanized Recon VI: Advanced Field Spies"
 tech_mech_recon6_desc:0 "Field spies are army espionage elements that disguise themselves as enemy units or civilians in order to evade detection. They do not operate as part of an intelligence agency but rather as part of an army, relaying active locations to an enemy, usually in urban warfare where it is easiest for them to be in position. Field spies require concealable and covert equipment such as compact radios or modified civilian phones in order to operate. Utilizing civilian vehicles, field spies can infiltrate urban and rural positions faster and potentially blend in."
 tech_mech_recon7:0 "Mechanized Recon VII: Mobile Deep-Wire Recon"
 tech_mech_recon7_desc:0 "Deep Wire Recon is a highly advanced operation in which recon elements position themselves far beyond enemy lines in order to relay information.

 #Engineers
 
 tech_engineers:0 "Engineer I: Defenders"
 tech_engineers_desc:0 "Defenders are the most basic form of combat engineers. Defenders perform the basic task of constructing entrenchments and setting up defensive structures, clearing paths, and setting up basic camps. Defenders require basic tools like shovels and axes, basic fortification kits, and mines."
 tech_engineers2:0 "Engineer II: Sappers"
 tech_engineers2_desc:0 "Sappers are another name for combat engineers. Sappers are used for more direct combat tasks such as breaching fortifications and running counter operations to clear minefields and obstacles. Sappers require breaching charges, high explosives, minefield clearing equipment, flamethrowers, bolt cutters, and other pieces of equipment necessary to counteract fortifications."
 tech_engineers3:0 "Engineer III: Bridgers"
 tech_engineers3_desc:0 "Bridgers are combat engineers that use bridging equipment to aid river crossings. These engineers construct bridges out of local materials such as logs or laying out stone in order to make makeshift bridges. This process can be long and arduous to do manually and in larger divisions relies on the bridger engineers to be foremen for other soldiers to construct the bridges. Bridgers require axes or stone cutting tools, rope, and bridging kits to do this job. "
 tech_engineers4:0 "Engineer IV: Junglers"
 tech_engineers4_desc:0 "Junglers are combat engineers that clear areas of jungle using defoliants or fire as well as improved tools for creating jungle fortifications. Doing this aids combat and allows for combat engineers to provide an important edge in the difficult jungle environment. However, most of the development of junglers goes into techniques and jungle warfare theories, as a result they don't assist any other combat environments."
 tech_engineers5:0 "Engineer V: Combat Engineers"
 tech_engineers5_desc:0 "Combat Engineers may need to play a more direct role in combat. At some point, they need to build advanced forward bases within hotzones. Combat engineers need to be able to set up fortifications and advanced bases in extremely short amounts of time and of high quality. This requires even more advanced individual equipment, a rapid supply train that can deliver all the materials necessary, and more durable gear for sustaining in dangerous zones."
 tech_engineers6:0 "Engineer VI: Pioneers"
 tech_engineers6_desc:0 "Pioneers are combat engineers that can take on any environment and any regional challenge in the world. They are capable engineers that are proficient anywhere that you can send them. They use versatile, lightweight tools and equipment to build fortifications, ease movement, or breach enemy fortifications."
 tech_engineers7:0 "Engineer VII: Urban Warfare Engineers/Field Engineers"
 tech_engineers7_desc:0 "Urban warfare engineers are the evolution of the combat engineer and the sapper. Urban warfare engineers are specialists in urban warfare and are capable of erecting advanced fortifications and facilities in urban environments. Not only can they improve the combat capability of troops in urban environments, but they can also deal with urban hazards resulting from warfare such as rubble, exposed electrical wires, toxic floods, and so forth. These guys make urban warfare slightly less of a Hell for your troops and the manifestation of Eternal Fire itself for the enemy.\nField Engineers are the evolution of defenders. Field Engineers specialize in erecting improved facilities, defenses, and clearing paths. Using more developed equipment, field engineers are able to clear paths faster and construct quicker than ever before."

 tech_armor_engineers2:0 "Armored Engineer II: Mechanized Sappers"
 tech_armor_engineers2_desc:0 "Sappers are another name for combat engineer. At this point, sappers are used for more direct combat tasks such as breaching fortifications and running counter operations to clear minefields and obstacles. Sappers require breaching charges, high explosives, minefield clearing equipment, flamethrowers, bolt cutters, and other pieces of equipment necessary to counteract fortifications. Mechanized Sappers use bunker busting vehicles and supply trucks in order to aid their assaults and better support the primary attackers."
 tech_armor_engineers3:0 "Armored Engineer III: Mechanized Bridgers"
 tech_armor_engineers3_desc:0 "Bridgers are combat engineers that use bridging equipment to aid river crossings. These engineers construct bridges out of local materials such as logs or laying out stone in order to make makeshift bridges. This process can be long and arduous to do manually and in larger divisions relies on the bridger engineers to be foremen for other soldiers to construct the bridges. Bridgers require axes or stone cutting tools, rope, and bridging kits to do this job. Mechanized Bridgers use special bridging vehicles in order to build bridges faster in the field."

 tech_armor_engineers4_desc:0 "Junglers are combat engineers that clear areas of jungle using defoliants or fire as well as improved tools for creating jungle fortifications. Doing this aids combat and allows for combat engineers to provide an important edge in the difficult jungle environment. However, most of the development of junglers goes into techniques and jungle warfare theories. Advanced Junglers use large bulldozers, clear cutting vehicles, flame-throwing tanks, and defoliant helicopters to better provide support for other troops or to defeat other forces attempting to use the jungle to their advantage."
 tech_armor_engineers5:0 "Armored Engineer V: Armored Combat Engineers"
 tech_armor_engineers5_desc:0 "Combat Engineers are engineers that play a more direct role in combat. They build advanced forward bases within' hotzones. Combat engineers need to be able to set up fortifications and advanced bases in extremely short amounts of time and of high quality. This requires even more advanced individual equipment, a rapid supply train that can deliver all the materials necessary, and more durable gear for sustaining in dangerous zones. Armored Combat Engineers use heavily armored vehicles and engineer tanks in order to better protect themselves in the urban environment and fight in siege environment."

They are capable engineers that are proficient anywhere that you can send them. They use versatile, lightweight tools and equipment to build fortifications, ease movement, or breach enemy fortifications. Motorized Pioneers use modern construction vehicles and supply vehicles in order to do their job faster and with better results than Pioneers that do not have access to heavy equipment."
 tech_armor_engineers7:0 "Armored Engineer VII: Mobile UWE/FE"

Urban warfare engineers are specialists in urban warfare and are capable of erecting advanced fortifications and facilities in urban environments. Not only can they improve the combat capability of troops in urban environments, but they can also deal with urban hazards resulting from warfare such as rubble, exposed electrical wires, toxic floods, and so forth. These guys make urban warfare slightly less of a Hell for your troops and the manifestation of Eternal Fire itself for the enemy. Mobile Urban Warfare Engineers use heavily armored vehicles and engineer tanks in order to clear hazards and provide better support during city sieges.\nField Engineers are the evolution of defenders. Field Engineers specialize in erecting improved facilities, defenses, and clearing paths. Using more developed equipment, field engineers are able to clear paths faster and construct quicker than ever before. Mobile Field Engineers use clearing vehicles, helicopters, construction vehicles, engineer tanks, and many more sets of advanced equipment to do their job better than Field Engineers that lack this equipment can."

 tech_field_hospital_desc:0 "Medical companies are support companies comprised of medical staff including field surgeons, combat medics, nurses, and so on. They tend to the health and well-being of soldiers in the field. The simplest medical companies simply equip medical personnel with lightweight equipment and give them training and discipline to handle the horrors of war. It isn't necessary to train them to work under pressure and time constraints because medical personnel always have to work like that."
 tech_field_hospital2:0 "Medicine II: Field Hospitals"
 tech_field_hospital2_desc:0 "Creating portable field hospitals greatly aids in assisting the wounded. Incapacitated soldiers taken to field hospitals where medical equipment is set up have a much greater chance of surviving than medics trying to patch them up while they are getting shot at in the mud. Field hospitals must have lightweight equipment and armored field ambulances in order to be portable with the army and recover soldiers during active battle."
 tech_field_hospital3:0 "Medicine III: Portable Hospital Equipment"
 tech_field_hospital3_desc:0 "While having massive machines and full hospital beds with monitors can be great ways to save lives, brick-and-mortar hospitals are unfortunately not transportable.

 tech_field_hospital5:0 "Medicine V: Military Medical Research"
 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "Civilian doctors and medical researchers (hopefully) do not have to deal with vast levels of patients coming in with extreme combat injuries on a regular basis. It is for this reason that the art of combat medicine only gained scientific insight when wars are in progress or the country is vastly unstable. Although if a country is unstable, there aren't likely to be that many doctors with well funded hospitals. Therefore, it is prudent to include medical researchers who can study and create new techniques and medical supplies to deal with combat injuries."
 tech_field_hospital6:0 "Medicine VI: Military Psychiatrists"
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "Not everyone who is put out of commission in the military is killed or wounded. The violent and hellish nature of warfare leaves many soldiers with PTSD. This unfortunate state leaves veterans infirm or unable to return to civilian life and unable to continue serving in the military. Military psychiatrists exist to aid mentally traumatized soldiers and allow them to continue serving in the military or be discharged and able to peacefully return to civilian life with minimal to no psychiatric problems or PTSD triggers."
 tech_field_hospital7:0 "Medicine VII: Military Trauma Medicine"
 tech_field_hospital7_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of CIMR, trauma medicine involves specialized equipment to deal with extreme injuries and stabilize severe physiological problems associated with major trauma. This, combined with the necessity of lightweight, compact medicine in warfare pushes medical ingenuity to its brink. This includes temporary artificial organs that perform simple tasks, high potency anesthetics, highly advanced aids, and miniaturized trauma ward equipment. Military trauma medicine can bring soldiers that would be considered doomed in prior years back from the edge."

Government officials, police, and security operatives are natural targets and belligerents in a conflict so military police must retain order and suppress insurgency. Basic military police are no more advanced or different from normal police forces with the exception of more combat training and the ability to establish beats within' an unfamiliar zone."
 tech_military_police2:0 "Military Police II: Counter-Insurgent Operations"
 tech_military_police2_desc:0 "Insurgents and partisans can be extremely dangerous to a war operation and provide problems on a strategic level. From sabotage to ambushes to providing the enemy with intel, anyone can become an insurgent. Being able to hunt insurgents and partisans and suppress rebellion in a warzone is a critical operation. Firearms and weapons must be confiscated, militia cells must be found and destroyed, and the operatives themselves must be terminated. Therefore special equipment and militarized variants of police equipment must be made and protocols for suppression must be planned."
 tech_military_police3:0 "Military Police III: Riot Control"
 tech_military_police3_desc:0 "Aside from militia cells, disorganized riots can also arise from rebelling populations who do not have an understanding of guerilla warfare or resistance theory. Although not as dangerous as a fully organized militia cell, riots can cause serious disorder, prevent access to resources and industry, and rally support for partisans. It is therefore necessary to control and put down riots. However, using shear lethal force, although easy and effective, only radicalizes local populations and fulfills the riot's initial purpose. Thus, developing military grade riot control techniques in order to maintain order and suppress demonstration is of vital importance."

 tech_military_police4:0 "Military Police IV: War Relief Corps"
 tech_military_police4_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely suppress resistance and pacify populations. Peaceful resistance is always possible and can be problematic. Additionally, the shear devastation caused by war can lead partisans to form cells. Providing war relief is prudent for numerous reasons. War relief helps a region recover faster during and after a war. War relief helps maintain wealth and development that would otherwise be lost. War relief speeds up recovery. Finally, providing war relief can win the most important war of all. The war of hearts and minds. "
 tech_military_police5:0 "Military Police V: Peacekeeping"
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "Peacekeeping is a proactive measure to preventing uprisings and reducing devastation. Peacekeeping operations typically involve training new, local security forces to enforce the law and restore normalcy. Order and stability are the greatest methods of pacification. Peacekeeping requires military police to be trained to establish local security and vet for individuals who will not wind up becoming problems to become those security operatives. Additionally, it requires logistical lines for security provisions to be established so security beats can be established."
 tech_military_police6:0 "Military Police VI: Memetic Suppression"
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "Winning hearts and minds with war relief and peacekeeping are good ways to prevent insurgency. However, not everyone is convinced, especially patriots and demagogues. It is therefore necessary to use fear as a tool to suppress other individuals. However, this fear cannot be delivered in such a way that it interferes with war relief or peacekeeping. Military reporters, propaganda, memetic warfare and ideological debating, and other such methods are ways to sow doubt within' an occupied population. "
 tech_military_police7:0 "Military Police VII: Modern Non-Lethal Weapons and Tactics"
 tech_military_police7_desc:0 "Non-lethal tactics and weapons have been used since the dawn of human civilization and are naturally a part of occupation. However, dealing with domestic crime is a different game than dealing with insurgents. To better control the population and not inspire resistance and provide psychological suppression, new methods for incapacitation must be created. Investing large amounts into developing non-lethal weapons, chemicals, training, and equipment will pay off by enabling smaller amounts of troops to have a greater suppressive impact."

Magnetic writing uses a switched magnet to switch the magnetized elements in a magnetized medium in order to create non-volatile memory. Early magnetic memories were not deemed commercially feasible due to their very small capability and the rate by which the magnetic pole needs to move around the disk. "
 hardware_II_desc:0 "Magnetic core memory is amongst the earliest forms of RAM. The core uses tiny magnetic rings with massive numbers of wires threaded to read and write information. Each core could hold one bit of information and would be magnetized in one direction or the other to store a 1 or zero. This allowed the temporary storage of data for extremely rapid access and modification, the same that RAM is used for today. It cannot be used as general data storage because it is extremely bulky compared to storage devices and also far more expensive to the bit, just like RAM today."
 hardware_III_desc:0 "First invented by IBM in 1956, the HDD was quickly adopted as the primary digital data storage device. The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a form of data storage that uses magnetic storage to read and right digital data. The disk uses a rapidly rotating disk coated with magnetic material. Magnetic heads can alter and read data on the disk while it is rotating. HDDs can store overwhelmingly more data that prior forms of digital storage."
 hardware_IV_desc:0 "Computer auxiliaries are items such as the keyboard, mouse, screen, etc. Computer auxiliaries exist in the primitive form before researching this. As computers get smaller and smaller, eventually they reach a point where basic auxiliaries become more important.

Without RAM, programs would run vastly slower and might not allow data to be read or written in the same amount of time relative to the physical location of the data. RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry (circuitry combining multiple digital signals into one shared signal)  to connect data lines to the addressed storage and allow for programs to easily access and modify data."

 software_I_desc:0 "While mechanical computing may have served an important role early on in assisting researchers and engineers before and during WW2, the complex needs of the growing world presented the need to develop computers beyond what they could do simply with gears and preset calculations. Early computing theories led to the development of early electronic computers that more or less served the same role with similar capacity to mechanical computers but in a way that allowed them to take on vastly larger tasks and bring about the first major computers."
 software_II_desc:0 "The preset programming of early computers left a lot to be desired and only allowed computers to take on highly specific tasks with arduously assembled programs. Binary programming languages allowed computers to take on a vastly larger diversity of tasks and would also allow a greater level of accessibility in computing."
 software_III_desc:0 "A high-level programming language is a programming language that abstracts from the binary details of the computer's processing itself. They read natural language (IE add_research_slot = 50) and turn that into a processable element. This allows them to be programmed on a macro level without the need to individually assign unabstracted elements to process data. "
 software_IV_desc:0 "The quicksort algorithm is an efficiency sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 that systematically places elements into an organized array. It is used to sort data in a computer and outdid prior sorting algorithms like merge sort and heapsort. Sorting is an extremely common process conducted in computer software and as such, needs to be highly efficient and a poorly created sorting algorithm can lead to unnecessarily large processing loads. Quicksort is still used today because it's just that good."
 software_V_desc:0 "Packet switching is a method of grouping digital data and transmitting it over a digital network. They are led by a header and the data itself is in the payload which trails the header. The header navigates a network according to the data placed in it. This allows data to navigate highly complex networks where there are multiple hosts to reach and different data nodes to travel between. However, there are a few issues such as packet loss which affect packet switching networks. Wireless transmission (not available at the time of researching this) and network congestion can cause packets to fail to reach their destination and be lost. The Transmission Control Protocol is an internet protocol that ensures accurate data transfer and detects when packets are lost so it can try again or correct the errors."

This software allows computers to simulate the free-stream flow of liquids and gases. This highly complex software benefits greatly from strong computers and can allow engineers to simulate many different problems involving aerodynamics, fluids, weather, etc. CFD problems fundamentally rely on the Navier-Stokes equations that define single-phase fluid flows."
 software_VII_desc:0 "Eventually, modular, large-scale massively-parallel supercomputers became possible. As a result of design improvements and better administrative domains and internal protocols, massively-parallel supercomputers could become vast in size. These supercomputers can be used to store or back up more data than before, and process more than early models. Because they have so much value and purpose confined to a single space, these supercomputers are usually kept under extreme security underground with heavily vetted personnel being the only ones allowed to work on them physically. "

CAD software makes designing far easier and improves productivity and quality quite a bit. It can also provide easy-access databases, communication tools, macros, and other toolkits to further aid the designing process. CAD software can be used to design many different things including machines, architecture, electronics, etc. With computer-aided manufacturing, CAD can directly allow machines to precisely carry out designs with extreme precision and efficiency."
 software_X_desc:0 "64-bit computing is the use of 64-bit architecture in computers. Every 1 or 0 in a binary language takes up 1 bit. In 64-bit architecture, 64-bits are arranged into a single memory address, which is a reference to a specific memory location used at software and hardware levels. What makes 64-bits special is because 64-bit computers have an integer limit of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, whereas 32-bit systems are capped at about 2.147 billion. This allows far more unique variables to be stored and processed by a system than ever before. There are simpler programs today that still use 32-bit, but many software need to use 64-bit architecture because of their sheer complexity."
 software_XI_desc:0 "Multi-threading is the ability of a CPU to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently. Multithreading increased the utilization of a single core by using thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism. This enables a greater level of flexibility when multitasking whether a single core or multiple cores were being used.\nWhile simultaneous multi-threading has been around since 1968 and deployed within' a few years of that, this technology represents the optimization of multi-threading protocols and the introduction of protocols to protect against multiple threads sharing hardware resources like caches and a high level of efficiency."
 software_XII_desc:0 "Developing military logistics software eases a lot of the work on the general military staff and allows for a greater level of reliability in large military logistics networks and the organization of complex supply chains on a massive scale. This software can allow supply officers to put in orders digitally and improves the communication on complex networks. Additionally, this software can ease triages and supply prioritization as well as helps automatically locate anomalies in the supply lines."

This was eventually sharpened to create decimetric radar, which could detect incoming planes from further away and do so more precisely. Eventually, decimetric radar was lengthened to centimetric to enable long range radar detection. In order to lengthen the radar waves, significant improvements to the strength of the cavity magnetron are made. The cavity magnetron is a high powered vacuum tube used to generate microwaves and turn them into radio waves. It was made stronger than ever and could create very powerful centimetric beams."
 radar_I_desc:0 "Monopulse radar is a radar system that encodes its radio signal on different levels so when the beam bounces back, it provides highly accurate data based on how the different pulses come back. Because the radio signal uses additional encoding it is able to emit only 1 pulse for accurate data hence the name 'monopulse'."
 radar_II_desc:0 "Doppler Beam Sharpening is a method of processing radar signals into a radar-image. Using a synthetic aperture, the motion of the radar antenna provides finer spatial resolution than conventional beam-scanning radars. SAR defines a 3D array of scene elements using returns from the beam. With this array, SAR runs algorithms and calculations to determine a precise image of whatever it is scanning."

Bit-flipping is another attack that relies on already knowing part of a message. If the encrypted messages follow a certain format, then it is easy to use the known information as a base. "
 decryption_II_desc:0 "Differential cryptanalysis is a method of attack in which pairs of plaintext and ciphertext are abused in a cryptologic system in order to discover a key. This requires access to the plaintext and ciphertext inputs and outputs. By inputting a variety of messages and comparing them to the encrypted text, the encrypting key can be discovered and used against the desired encrypted information."
 decryption_III_desc:0 "Brute force, as the name implies, is an extremely simplistic and straightforward method of decryption. By simply attempting every possible solution or key until you arrive at a solution with immense processing power, an encrypted message can be deciphered.

Instead, taking measures to breach vulnerabilities in software remotely is desirable to access the unencrypted information directly. Additionally, creating malicious software or spyware to infect a host via vulnerabilities or traps can open backdoors by themselves. "
 decryption_VI_desc:0 "An exploit kit is a collection of exploits for vulnerabilities organized in a massive catalog acting as a repository. Exploit kits contain massive numbers of exploits for virtually all vulnerabilities in virtually all versions of virtually all software targeted by an exploit kit's maker. Doing this enables a malware creator or hacker to simply create the malware they desire and attach a functional exploit. All a malware creator needs to know is the software and versions of a piece of software that a target computer uses and they can browse the exploit kit. If the exploit kit makers have found a vulnerability and made the exploit, the malware creator merely needs to hook it and expose the target computer to it. Government-owned kits can keep vulnerabilities secret for years until they desire to launch a massive attack."

The primary objective of TPM is to ensure that the productivity of an industrial division is maintained through a modest investment into maintenance and improvements. \nIn order to establish a TPM regimen, dedicated maintenance teams are necessary and resources must be regularly invested to enhance the volume of production."
 management_II:0 "Preventive Maintenance" 
 management_II_desc:0 "Preventative maintenance is a core aspect of TPM in which maintenance and inspections are conducted ahead of time before a breakdown occurs. Through systematic inspection, detection, and correction of failures during non-productive hours work is carried out to avoid breakdown or malfunction. The development of PM requires the development of a regime, special maintenance teams and tools, and a training system in order to enable maintainers to detect potential failures or wearing ahead of time."
 management_III_A:0 "Periodic Maintenance"
 management_III_A_desc:0 "Periodic maintenance is a reduction of the TPM regimen scheduled based on the estimated lifespan of machines or parts. Based off of trends, inspections are planned and conducted periodically and is not as extensive as predictive maintenance, as it results in less frequent inspections. Periodic maintenance reduces overall costs, but has less productivity and more common failures due to the less intensive and regular maintenances."

High-speed metros, high-capacity buses, monorails, modern ferries and cable cars, and potentially even experimental public transit systems overwhelmingly cut down commute times and substantially increase commuting capacity. Additionally, advanced public transit systems can create a feedback loop in which better and cheaper access to commuting options leads to less traffic which leads to more efficient commuting and to overall savings on transportation which allows more income and thus leads to more public transit etc, creating a gradual growth of public transit systems."
 inframunicipal_IV_desc:0 "Having high-throughput intersections and freeflow blocks greatly reduces travel time and reduces costs by reducing time at stops and journey time irregularities.

 arm_ht_desc:0 "Heavy tank\n Heavy tanks are protected against nearly all types of weapons, but their utility is limited by poor mobility.\n\nArmored Engineer Vehicle\n These heavy vehicles serve special roles such as deploying bridges, breaching obstacles, and moving earth to support mechanized forces."
 arm_mt_desc:0 "MBT\n Main Battle Tanks are balanced between the armor and firepower of heavy tanks and the mobility of light tanks.\n\nSP artillery\n Self Propelled artillery can deal significant damage from a distance to both infantry and lightly-armored vehicles." 
 arm_lt_desc:0 "The armor of light tanks won't withstand hits from larger guns, but it can protect against small arms. Light tanks are significantly more mobile than their heavier counterparts."
 arm_mech_desc:0 "APC\n Armored Personnel Carriers provide improved mobility and protection to infantry.\n\nIFV\n Infantry Fighting Vehicles are less mobile than APCs, but bring heavier armaments and armor to the battlefield.\n\nAirborne APC\n These specialized APCs are equipped for airborne deployment.\n\nATGM carrier\n Dedicated ATGM carriers are the modern army's solution to the threat of MBTs. Missiles are extremely powerful against armored targets but their anti-infantry effectiveness is limited.\n\nRecon vehicle\n Small and nimble vehicles built to scout terrain and assess the composition of enemy forces. They are not equipped for frontline combat."
 arm_mot_desc:0 "Truck\n Trucks grant infantry much greater strategic mobility, but otherwise they don't provide any significant, direct combat value.\n\nSP rocket artillery\n Dedicated to anti-infantry attacks, rocket artillery inflicts very little damage against armored targets."
