A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations.

However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war.

However, the craft was proved to be unstable, structurally unsound and its generators were not strong enough to fully power its gun turrets. With the advent of jet-powered bombers like the Tu-16, Soviet military planners decided that it simply was not worth devoting the necessary resources to fix its numerous problems, and so the project was cancelled."

 VIN_team_weapons_1_short: "SG-43, M1938"
 VIN_team_weapons_1_desc: "The SG-43 is a medium machine gun developed by PM Goryunov to replace the out-of-date, by WWII standards the PM M1910 MG was used by the Soviet Union in most of the war. The SG-43 used a tilting breechblock and came with an apparatus on the bottom that allowed to to be mounted on tripods, wheeled mounts, or on vehicles as a support weapon. The barrel is air-cooled and very dense making it difficult to cool in most temperatures but comes with a chromium-plated bore that can sustain them. This makes it unreliable in higher temperatures. It saw heavy usage around the end of WWII. It has been licensed to vast numbers of countries resulting it it seeing combat in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Although the weapon itself also has a track record of being involved in many, many civil wars.\nThe M1938 mortar is a 120mm soviet mortar used heavily by the Soviet army during WWII. Its design is a near-copy of the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm. The mortar itself is very easy to limber and unlimber and could move around quickly to avoid counter fire. It uses very heavy 120mm shells and had a high rate of fire, making it a strong weapon for hitting enemy encampments or infantry in heavy cover such as buildings."
 VIN_team_weapons_2: "120-PM-43 (mortar), KPV (HMG)"
 VIN_team_weapons_2_short: "120-PM-43, KPV"
 VIN_team_weapons_2_desc: "The KPV is a heavy machine gun designed for the Soviets in 1944 by Semen Vladimirov. It was not brought into production or service until 1949. The gun itself was eventually taken out of infantry service in the mid 1960s for its immense weight and replaced with an alternate HMG. It is notorious for its exceptional 3000 meter horizontal range and 2000 aerial range. Its heavy caliber could also make it useful a light-anti armor weapon and was placed on scout cars and BTRs. It saw usage during the Korean and Vietnam war and its hand down leasing has led these weapons to see combat in many different wars. Even today, the gun itself has not yet been taken out of service and has seen modern conflicts such as the Gulf and Iraq wars.\nThe 120-PM-43 mortar was a 120mm muzzle loaded breech Soviet mortar developed in 1943 and was a modified version of the M1938. Its design was heavily simplified and its weight and costs were vastly reduced. It was used in the end of WWII and saw soviet usage in the Afghanistan wars as well as Vietnam and the Gulf war."
 VIN_team_weapons_3: "NSV (HMG), ASG-17 (HGL)"
 VIN_team_weapons_3_short: "NSV, ASG-17"
 VIN_team_weapons_3_desc: "The NSV is a heavy machine gun designed by Nikitin, Sokolov, and Volkov in 1971. Although it has less range than the KPV, the gun itself has a few advantages including weighing much less, allowing it to continue to be used as an infantry HMG and greater levels of versatility. It was also known to be more reliable and cheaper to manufacture, allowing for an overall improvement as an infantry HMG. It saw combat in the Afghan and Vietnam wars as well as both Iraq wars and the Syrian Civil war.\nThe ASG-17 is a heavy automatic grenade launcher designed by KBP in 1967. It is designed to operate from a vehicle or fortified position. The standard drum can contain up to 29 grenades and can fire all of them in 10 seconds. It has been used extensively by the Soviet Union and it demonstrated considerable reliability in Afghanistan."
 VIN_team_weapons_4: "NSVT (HMG), 2B14 (Mortar)"
 VIN_team_weapons_4_short: "NSVT, 2B14"
 VIN_team_weapons_4_desc: "The NSVT is an improved variant of the NSV HMG that was improved by its original designers some time after the initial weapon was put out. The NSVT featured improvements such as lighter weight from simplified parts and more modernized materials to allow the weapon to sustain fire for longer. It was also around this time that various attachments were developed for the HMG. The NSVT is well known for being mounted on Soviet MBTs such as the 64, the 72, and the 80.\nThe 2B14 is a modern light indirect fire mortar designed in 1983 by the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant for use in airborne and light infantry forces. The weapon fires a 82mm modern mortar and has a fire rate of approximately 24 rounds per minute. Its high rate of fire and efficient logistical design made it an excellent weapon for the Soviets and saw usage well outside its intended purpose including motor rifle units. Its success was seen largely during the Afghan war."
 VIN_team_weapons_5: "Kord-6P50 (HMG), ASG-30 (HGL)"
 VIN_team_weapons_5_short: "Kord-6P50, ASG-30"
 VIN_team_weapons_5_desc: "The Kord 6P50 is a Russian HMG designed by Namitulin, Obidin, Bogdanov, and Zhirokhin. The weapon has extensive changes over the former NSVT including a rotating bolt replacing the pivoting breech lock, an improved gas system, and reworked muzzle baffle. The gun has much less recoil giving it higher accuracy and longer sustained fire times, making it better for suppressing fire and long range fire support. It is also vastly lighter and produces a higher volume of fire. It has seen combat in a large variety of modern Russian and Russian-sphere conflicts including the Russo-Georgian war and the Syrian Civil war. There are also reports that it has been seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with the US albeit rarely.\nThe ASG-30 is a heavy grenade launcher developed in 1990 by the KBP bureau for the Soviet Union but was not adopted until after the dissolution in 1995 by the Russian federation. It fires at a rate of 400 rounds per minute and is equipped with a blowback action. Its design is based heavily off of the AGS-17 and is massively lighter, more mobile, has a longer range, and is more accurate. The launcher has gained notable prestige in its capability to take down fortified enemies. Its capability was proven in the second Chechen war where it proved to be a highly capable weapon."

The grenade itself saw a better level of anti-armor capability compared to its predecessor and featured an improved fuse and potent filling mixture.\nThe F1 AP grenade is a shared development AP/frag grenade wherein the Russian arms manufacturers improved the existing French F1 grenade by fitting a modern tripwire fuse and a TNT filling with a higher quality set of fragmenting metal shell. It has seen virtually all Russian combat from WWII when it was developed in 1941 to the present day.\nThe MON landmines are a series of early landmines developed for the Soviet Union by various designers from the 50s to the 60s. The MON landmines are all anti-personnel and typically use fragmentation and TNT to perform area denial missions. They have seen virtually all combat by the Soviet Union in the 50s and 60s."
 VIN_ammo_explosives_3: "Modern AP Ammunition, TM Mines (Landmines)"
 VIN_ammo_explosives_3_short: "Modern AP Ammunition, TM Mines"
 VIN_ammo_explosives_3_desc: "AP rounds have existed for many years originating before WWI and used mostly in penetrating warships. Around WWI after the tank entered the battlefield, miniaturized rounds were created. Eventually, small AP calibers were created as an answer to body armor. Modern AP ammunition in 1965 was created as an answer to an increase in heavily armored infantry and infantry cover. The TM landmines are a series of Soviet anti-tank blast mines initially developed and widely used around 1941 but were discontinued due to a metal shortage that was prioritized to create other weapons. However, around 1957, they made a comeback and development and production of the TM mines were continued eventually using more modern explosives. TM mines saw frequent use almost wherever there was Soviet sphere conflict but their full potential was witnessed around the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan."

The shell itself is made of 2 serrated aluminum sections on top and bottom. The grenades themselves immediately explode on impact, making reaction from targets more difficult. They were created under project BAZALT during the Soviet-Afghan war and their impact explosions made it easier to hit targets in the rocky terrain.\nUtility grenades are hand grenades that have specialized roles such as flashbangs, smokes, incendiaries, etc. These can be used to stun enemies, conceal positions, and run area denial respectively.

 VIN_ammo_explosives_5_desc: "In the modern era, there are a vast arsenal of different types of specialized ammunitions that can be used in specific situations. Modern AP rounds are far better at penetrating targets than older AP rounds and can reach higher velocities. Modern alloys allow standard ammunition to deal more damage to a target. Frangible bullets or incendiary rounds have special situations in which they are useful. Additionally, shotguns can have improved usability in modern combat with HE rounds, 000 ammunition, flechette rounds, or incendiary shots."

It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective. The RPG-29 has been used in the Iraq war, the Syrian civil war, and the 2006 Lebanon war."

KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive. The Strela-3 was used in many different middle eastern conflicts such as the Iraq-Iran war, but didn't see much combat within' the Soviet sphere itself."

Mosin-Nagant rifles and carbines saw service on many fronts of the Cold War, from Korea and Vietnam to Afghanistan and along the Iron Curtain in Europe. Virtually every country that received military aid from the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe during the Cold War used Mosin-Nagants at various times."

 VIN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The K-56 is a Chinese 7.62x39mm rifle. It is a variant of the Soviet AK-47 and AKM rifles. During the Cold War period it was exported to many countries and guerrilla forces throughout the world. From the sands of Africa to the jungles of Southeast Asia you could probably find one of these. Chinese support for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam before the mid-1960s meant that the Type-56 was frequently encountered by American soldiers in the hands of either Vietcong guerrillas or PAVN soldiers during the Vietnam war."

 VIN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK-47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan."

 VIN_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK-74 is an assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Russian weapons designer Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the earlier AKM (itself a refined version of the AK-47). It used a smaller 5.45x39mm cartridge, replacing the 7.62x39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons. It first saw service with Soviet forces in the Afghanistan conflict. The AK-74 was equipped with a new buttstock, handguard, and gas cylinder. The stock has a shoulder pad different from that on the AKM, which is rubber and serrated for improved seating against the shooter."

 VIN_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-103 is an assault rifle designed by Russian weapons designer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1994. It is a derivative of the AKM. It is chambered in 7.62x39mm in a configuration similar to the AK-74M. The AK-103 can be fitted with a variety of sights, including night vision and telescopic sights, plus a knife-bayonet or a grenade launcher. It uses plastic components where possible instead of wood or metal, with such components being the pistol grip, handguards, stock and depending on the type, the magazine. The transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yielded a significant weight reduction and allow a soldier to carry more rounds for the same weight."
