 UIA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "One of our Special Domestic Agents has successfully infiltrated the UIA and the informational gain is incredible. We have gained an unprecedented amount of data and a network of confidential informants who will aid our fight against the Ukrainian insurgency. Already, our network has discovered countless supply depots and is capable of dismantling countless operations, severely weakening the capability of the UIA to do damage against our nation.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation."
 UIA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Following the failure of our Special Domestic Agent's attempt to infiltrate the UIA, the UIA has patched several vulnerable points in their operations, improved their vetting process, and become more resilient as a whole. Additionally, although our agent resisted interrogation, they were able to learn more about us from his actions and in the coming days, may attempt to use these techniques against lower level targets such as police stations and garrisons.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 UIA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A hard crackdown on the UIA's operations has resulted in astounding success. Our police forces were more than prepared to take down the enemy and caught them off guard. We have seized countless explosives, equipment, and killed many UIA operatives. Additionally, the raid has granted us large quantities of intel as they failed to destroy it in time.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The UIA knew we were coming. They either evacuated their facilities leaving firetraps set to detonate when the police got deep inside, or established ambushes against our police. Not only has this resulted in a severe failure, but the enemy even mounted counterattacks against our police stations and launch opportunistic supply grab attacks while our officers were busy or dead. The UIA is now vastly more well armed and capable of future attacks in the area. For the time being, we have sent in police reinforcements from nearby areas and even assigned soldiers to patrols to bolster the now weakened Soviet forces.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 UIA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "After several recon passes and countless hours of preparation, we finally launched our bombing strikes against remote UIA facilities. From apricot farms to beachside modern houses, their militia's facilities were greatly weakened. Our strikes leveled training facilities, made opportunistic runs against supply convoys, destroyed staging areas, and generally knocked out remote bases. The UIA is now vastly weaker and the lack of these remote facilities will disconnect their network of cells operating between cities.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 UIA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Not only was our intel incorrect, not only did we destroy countless non-targets, but we actually somehow managed to destroy some of our own nation's assets. Guard posts and our own army's supply trains were ravaged by the misdirection. From what our intel director says, the enemy had been feeding our confidential informants misinformation. In the future we may need to coordinate better with the army to ensure that if we do fail, it will not result in friendly fire.\nThis failure will weaken the army's capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 UIA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Red Army has proudly announced the complete annihilation of the UIA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army). After years of fighting, the UIA has been utterly destroyed after a final strike against the remnants of the UIA wiped out the fleeing, remaining leader and killed off what few assets they have left. So many militant Ukrainian independence supports died that the UIA is unlikely to be able to resurge.\nIn a press conference the head of Pravda, the Soviet Union's state media company, proudly announced that this should stand as a warning against all those who stand against the workers of the Soviet Union and its people.\nUkrainian loyalists who aided in the fight as well as countless unnamed confidential Special Domestic Agents will be rewarded for their sacrifice and service to the Soviet Union."
 UIA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "Following a brutal guerilla war and the destruction of critical Red Army airbases, the UIA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) has proudly announced that after years of fighting, Ukraine is free. The UIA has established an independent government and driven out all foreign officials and loyalist elements from the area. Thousands of Ukrainian nationalists have lined the streets to celebrate the founding of an independent nation.\nIn a press conference, the leaders of the insurgency have declared that this should serve as an example to all revolutionaries across all countries that no nation is too big or too powerful to be resisted and that all who seek independence from the Tyranny of their rulers should stand up and fight.\nUkrainian loyalists and KGB Special Domestic Agents have been brutally executed and key loyalists in the UIA will be rewarded by the group at large."

 KLFA_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "Some of our Special Domestic Agents who have relatives who work in agriculture managed to infiltrate Mau Mau undetected. They will now be able to acquire lots of information from within' the organization mostly due to family trust. We will be able to track enemy movements and prepare to counter major operations with this gain. The SDAs, however, expect their family members to be pardoned after the insurgency is dealt with in return.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation"
 KLFA_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Our Special Domestic Agents attempted to get into Mau Mau through family members who work in agriculture, but it backfired horribly. The SDAs trusted their family members too much and let them know they were agents and were captured and interrogated or killed. Additionally, some agents have even chosen family over country and given them information on our counter insurgency operations.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A series of rural raids on towns housing land army insurgents has resulted in a resounding success. Hundreds of enemy insurgents lie dead in their homes and their assets have been seized by the state. We have taken their weapons and equipment for ourselves and any stolen goods they have are now forfeit. The auctioning of the now deceased insurgents will also bring in a sizable level of income, most of which will likely go to executive incentives.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An attempt to raid enemy locations in rural towns using police assets has backfired. Many local police agencies have close ties with the enemy and chose this opportunity to backstab loyalist officers. There are now countless small towns and villages that are fully controlled by enemy insurgents and out of the hands of government control. Additionally, the enemy now controls a larger stockpile of weapons and arms from the traitorous police stations.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "Light jet firebombers have managed to destroy numerous known insurgent staging and training areas in the wilderness. In addition to scaring potential trainees, these bombings have caused a brain drain within' Mau Mau as numerous instructors have been killed resulting in a shortage of capable trainers within' Mau Mau's ranks. A combination of the brain drain and scare effects will likely prevent the enemy from being able to maintain intensity in their attacks.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our light jets targeted decoy locations rather than our intended targets. The enemy launched AA ambushes against our planes and took them down while they were targeting the cheap decoys. Losing these jets in the AO will allow the enemy to be more bold and take the opportunity to become more aggressive and launch attacks that could normally be prevented by air support.\nThis failure will weaken the army's capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."
 
 KLFA_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nAfter years of fighting, Mau Mau has been suppressed and what few supporters they have left are too afraid to rise again. The Kenyan rebellion, which desired an end to colonial rule, was suppressed by colonial forces and officially brought to an end with the capture of its leader, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge.\nThe British colonial officials have released a statement that with the end of the rebellion, Kenya will likely remain under British rule for a very long period of time. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen as many of Kenya's denizens still have serious problems with colonial policy and it may boil over in the future.\nRegardless, Mau Mau has been destroyed and the only thing that remains certain about the future is that they will not be a part of it."
 KLFA_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "After years of fighting, Mau Mau has successfully toppled British colonial rule and achieved their goals. The Kenyan rebellion, which desires to end colonial rule, has successfully driven out colonial loyalists and achieved their goals. Colonial garrisons were razed, British loyalists were expelled or killed, and the land armies of Mau Mau are returning to their farms.\nThe leader of Mau Mau, Field Marshal Stanley Mathenge, has announced in a press conference that this will bring on a new era of African independence from colonial oppression and promises to give Kenya \"all that it deserves and was denied\".\nMau Mau's success will mark a new chapter in Kenyan history and deliver a blow to Great Britain's empire."

 UPC_insurgency_options.0.d:0 "The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) published its declaration of independence, pro-independence riots broke out in Douala and Yaounde. Although the French colonial authorities suppressed the riots and banned the UPC, the UPC launched an armed struggle against the French. This escalation into armed resistance sees the end of over six years of tension between the UPC and French colonial authorities. French officials had sought to curtail UPC influence by suppressing voting and rejecting efforts to negotiate a peaceful transition for independence, but these tactics only pushed the UPC to war. For the UPC, despite having a leadership of men deeply connected to French culture and education, under Um Nyobe they have engaged in a more revolutionary path. This has alienated other Cameroonian elites who still look to France and reject the UPC's call for resistance. They prefer to achieve independence within the colonial system."
 UPC_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "\nThe French military's campaign of establishing pacification zones and breaking up the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) rebels pushed the fighting to the west among the Bamileke. The first Cameroon Pacification Zone saw the population put under heavy surveillance, within designated camps. These efforts saw many UPC leaders captured and killed but similar efforts in the west did not completely succeed. France's decision to grant Cameroon independence did not end the conflict as the UPC continued to resist what it saw as a French puppet state from its bases in the west. The new Cameroon government continued to rely on French military support as it continued a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that laid waste to many Bamileke villages. The recent assassination of another senior rebel leader seemingly broke the back of resistance as Cameroon appears to have finally defeated the rebels."
 UPC_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The French and their Cameroonian allies today accepted the independence of Bamilekia. What had originally started off as an anti-colonial struggle transformed into the fight for the independence of the Bamileke people. The French and Cameroonians both engaged in a policy of establishing pacification zones to control and uproot the rebels. This effort in Bamileke areas of Cameroon succeeded in isolating the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) fighters from the rest of Cameroon but kept them closely connected to the local Bamileke population. An alliance with the fighters and Bamileke elites ensured French and their Cameroonian allies' efforts in defeating the UPC were unsuccessful. Many among the Bamileke appear satisfied with their new nation and endorse a policy of reconstruction and socialism. However, there are also some elements who see Bamilekia as the legitimate government of Cameroon and desire to continue the struggle once the nation rebuilds itself."
 UPC_insurgency_options.15.d:0 "Numerous human rights organizations and nations have filed serious grievances against the French government and its actions in the Cameroonian war for independence. The French government is cited to have destroyed entire villages including non-rebelling civilians.\n\nIt is unknown how many civilians were killed in these villages as records were not properly kept and it is unknown how many fled or escaped the attacks by the French colonial forces.

 SSU_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Sudanese government and military are both divided into warring factions who are constantly acting against each other.

He is already exchanging intelligence on troop positions, morale, and tactical approaches, this information will prove invaluable to our efforts."
 SSU_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "In an effort to gain a local informant within the Sudanese government forces, we asked a Sudanese Defense Force deserter to change his identity and join a local pro-government militia. With his previous knowledge of the military we had hoped he would quickly rise in the militia and provide essential information for our forces. However, it appears he was identified by the government forces who managed to convince him to act as a double agent. We realized this after our forces in the area suffered a series of setbacks and before we could act against him he had already led government agent to capture the operatives who led this infiltration effort.

This allowed a small force of enemy fighters to be rallied by their officer and they quickly counterattacked. The shock of the enemy action caused our fighters to fall back and retreat. We suffered several casualties and some men became enemy prisoners, greatly boosting enemy morale in the area."
 SSU_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "In a strategic area, our forces noticed the Sudanese government forces were manning a checkpoint at a key intersection during the day. Villagers and travelers were being stopped and checked in the hopes of hindering the movement of arms among our forces. In response to this, the local commander successfully planted explosives at the site overnight, when government forces arrived in the morning, the explosives went off, causing the government forces to withdraw and flee the area, raising our morale and standing among the people."
 SSU_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our supporters identified a local police station in a small village where some of our local fighters and supporters are being detained. We planned to bomb the perimeter in order to inflict casualties on enemy forces guarding the facility and maybe allow some detained men to escape. However, we underestimated enemy vigilance and two of our men were captured attempting to plant the explosives. The government has made a big show of their arrest and showed the locals the bombs, claiming we were targeting civilians, hurting our standing in the area."

 SUD_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Anyanya are riddled with factionalism and disorganization. Our intelligence and military officers identified a regional Anyana leader who has grown dissatisfied with the cause and would be interested in transitioning into a militia leader for us. Before we bring him into the fold, we are utilizing him to collect intelligence and Anyanya tactics against our forces. With this successful infiltration we are hoping to completely uproot and breakdown rebel influence in the region."
 SUD_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Considering the diversity of South Sudan, it has been easy at times for our forces to rally and raise local militias to support our efforts to keep Sudan unified. A team of intelligence agents sought to take one of the local militia soldiers and sent him to join Anyanya force operating in the area. He would provide intelligence that would allow our men to uproot the rebels and detain their main supporters. However, this operation proved to be a failure as our mole appeared to have defected. Poor planning by our own agents saw the defector identify some of our local supporters in the village and the Anyanya fighters managed to target those men and capture weapons from the local armory."
 SUD_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A blatantly obvious Anyanya-sympathetic villager was tracked to a local camp by a local militiaman. With this intelligence, the local military commander led our troops to assault the Anyanya rebel camp. The operation proved a huge success as the campus was taken by surprise. Though several rebels fled deep into the forest, we did inflict casualties and took prisoners. More significantly, most of the camps supplies and weapons were seized, no doubt weakening Anyanya operations in the area."
 SUD_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "An overzealous officer, who we suspect may have been seeking some quick glory to secure a promotion, led his men into an enemy trap. South Sudan is a vast land and the commander decided to launch a nighttime assault on a suspected Anyanya camp deep in the grasslands. The men were ill-prepared and easily spotted by the enemy. Instead of hitting the enemy camp, our forces were instead hit by an enemy ambush, causing us to suffer casualties. More humiliatingly, some men were even captured by the rebels. This setback has hurt morale and the regional commander fears government forces in the area may melt away if the rebels attack."
 SUD_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Air Force has made up for the lack of sophisticated equipment by modifying available aircraft to act as reconnaissance and even close air support aircraft. The ingenuity of our forces was apparent went our modified aircraft spotted a rebel camp from the air. The pilot went into action and hit the enemy. When our forces arrived at the camp, they found the Anyanya had abandoned their casualties, weapons, food, and documents. The cowardly rebels will no doubt fear the air and news of our prowess in the sky has raised morale."
 SUD_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "The Air Force has made up for the lack of sophisticated equipment by modifying available aircraft to act as reconnaissance and even close air support aircraft. However, despite the creativity and dedication of our pilots, a recent operation ended up in a major failure. A plane doing a local patrol spotted Anyanya fighters moving, the pilot reacted and dropped several bombs on the enemy. However, it turned out the pilot had hit a group of migratory tribesmen, we are not yet sure on casualties. This accident has only emboldened enemy forces in the area and has hurt our image in the area."

 SSU_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The independence of Sudan saw the forced unification North and South Sudan. The administration and military of the new state was dominated by the northerners. This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the new government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. After a series of engagements between the Sudanese government and the Anyanya a brutal attritional conflict emerged. To end the civil war and end the expensive stalemate, the Sudanese government and the rebels have signed an agreement in Addis Ababa. South Sudanese autonomy will be guaranteed in the Sudanese conflict, hopefully bringing an end to the long violence plaguing the country."

This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the new government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. Although the Anyanya sought to exploit the factions within the Sudanese government and military, they ultimately failed. The Sudanese military managed to overcome its problems and coordinated its efforts against the rebels. Anyanya forces were soon outmaneuvered, infiltrated, and broken up by Sudanese government forces. With the military victory secured, time will tell if Sudan will be able to politically unite the country."

This led to increased tensions as southerners soon felt repressed by the government. A series of mutinies and protests in the south saw a rebel army called the Anyanya form from army deserters and rebel forces. The Anyanya were able to exploit the many factions within the Sudanese military to achieve stunning victories. After a series of successful campaigns across South Sudan, Sudanese military forces were soon driven from the land, leaving the area free for the Anyanya to establish political dominance over the population. With a military and political victory secure, the Sudanese government has accepted South Sudan as an independent state."
 SSU_insurgency_options.15.d:0 "Starting in 1955 shortly after the independence of the nation there has been a constant yet disorganized insurgency in Southern Sudan.  Now there are reports that larger, more organized insurgent cells have sprung up in South Sudan calling themselves \"The Anyanya\". The Anyanya desire independence from Sudan and strongly oppose the central government. Enraged by marginalization and the imposition of Muslim rule over non-Muslim periphery groups, the Anyanya will not rest until South Sudan is free from the rule of the northern majority.\n\nThe Sudanese government has responded by denying the allegations of marginalization and are mobilizing their forces to suppress the rebellion. Already, there are countless clashes in South Sudan and other minority communities in the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains are supporting the insurgents.\n\nAccording to reports, the Anyanya are being heavily supported by the neighboring and overwhelmingly Christian states of Uganda and Ethiopia."

Not only has this war taken on religious and cultural meanings, reinforcing the growing tension between Middle Eastern Islamic states and the non-Islamic states within the Middle East and its periphery.  Due to these factors, the war has become part of the larger conflict between these nations and is thus also a proxy war between the non-Arabic states in the region such as Israel, Ethiopia and the Republic of the Congo versus the United Arab Republic, Libya and other Arab states, while these states supply each of their sides other states such as Uganda wait on the sidelines weighing their options on which side is most beneficial to support."

He has successfully become their local interlocker but secretly he works for us. The enemy give him vital information which he passes to us and he works to undermine their efforts from within. This successful operation has improved our position in the area, and we hope to replicate this success elsewhere."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.2.d:0 "A local sheikh loyal to our cause has successfully managed to convince agents loyal the sultan he wishes to aid their efforts in the village. He has successfully become their local interlocker. We had hoped he would aid our efforts, but it turns out he has been seduced by the sultan and the wealth of his British masters. The sheikh has successfully helped the enemy uproot our supporters and hinder the operations of our fighters. Our efforts in the area have been undermined by this failed attempt to infiltrate the sultan."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.3.d:0 "The sultan and his puppet troops are nothing more than British stooges. In a recent operation, our fighters easily breached a military checkpoint and attacked the soldiers present. We inflicted casualties, captured weapons, and many of the survivors simply abandoned their weapons and fled. With this outpost eliminated we have been able to move men and arms much more freely as the forces of the sultan appear unwilling to risk moving back to it. This operation has raised morale amongst our men as rumors spread that among the casualties was a British officer."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.4.d:0 "A foolish leader of ours decided to lead his men to attack a royal outpost which he assumed would be lightly defended. However, upon launching the attack the enemy held firm and returned fire, driving our men in disarray. It appears the enemy were being supported by British advisors and they made short work of our attack. Setbacks like these will only hurt our morale and make men reluctant to carry out future operations."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.5.d:0 "An enemy armored car traveling through one of our towns was destroyed today. The number of casualties is unknown, but rumors have emerged that a senior officer or even a British solder was among the casualties. A team of ours had seen the vehicle stopped and succeeded in planting an explosive on the vehicle. The operation was a great success and shows we have increased our sophistication in tactics."
 SMI_Jebel_Adkhar.6.d:0 "In one of our villages, an attempt to plant explosives near a military outpost ended in embarrassing failure. The men were detained with the explosives and taken for interrogation. Unfortunately for us the men betrayed several of our local facilitators and they have been detained as well. Our presence in the village has been largely uprooted. Conducting these sorts of operations are unfamiliar to our men and these failures can be expected but this has negatively effected morale in the area."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.1.d:0 "The interior of Oman has long been the domain of the Imamate of Oman. However, their resistance has hindered efforts by the sultan to bring unity and development to the area. Intelligence operatives have identified several sheikhs in the interior who would be willing to provide us information on Imamate movements and curtail their activities in their regions in exchange for promises of development funds. In a recent operation we succeeded in turning one of these sheikhs to our side and the intelligence he has provided has allowed our forces to intercept enemy movements, thwart their operations, and identify Imamate supporters in the area. Successes like these will help us breakdown resistance to our mission."

Intelligence operatives have identified several sheikhs in the interior who would be willing to provide us information on Imamate movements and curtail their activities in their regions in exchange for promises of development funds. However, in a recent attempt to convince a sheikh to join us, our intelligence agent was tricked as we were given false intelligence. This led our men on wild goose chases and allowed the enemy to launch several daring strikes. By the time we realized we were being tricked, the damage had been done as the Imamate in the area has greatly increased their popularity and our forces are quite disheartened."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.3.d:0 "A unit of Omani soldiers supported with several British military advisors discovered several Imamate fighters were assembling in a strategic village located near a prospecting site. These fighters no doubt are planning to target the prospectors but a daring raid, planned by the British officers, saw our troops storm the town, capture or kill the rebels and end the threat. The operation has raised the morale of our Omani troops and has increased the cooperation between us and the British."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.4.d:0 "The biggest issue facing the Royal Army of Oman has been waging a counter-insurgency style of warfare few of its personnel and officers have trained for. The British advisors have been critical but are in short supply which has led to several failures like the recent operation to assault a hilly area suspected of being an Imamate staging ground. Our troops were ambushed before reaching the site and after taking casualties many simply fled in retreat. The British assessed the operation and cited a failure to properly plan, easily being discovered due to taking an obvious route, and a lack of effective leadership as the reason for the failure. This failed operation has weakened morale amongst our troops."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.5.d:0 "The Royal Air Force based in Oman was directed by an SAS team to target a suspected rebel camp. After the bombing run, our Royal Army of Oman soldiers entered the suspected camp and found Imamate forces had abandoned the area, leaving behind their casualties, weapons, and supplies due to the awesome power of the aircraft. The operation has no doubt greatly hurt enemy morale."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.6.d:0 "The Royal Air Force has been a critical support for our operations in the interior. They have identified enemy concentrations, destroyed enemy positions, and provided support for the Royal Army of Oman when under threat. However, in a recent operation, the Royal Air Force identified a concentration of rebel troops and deployed bombers who claimed to have destroyed the targets. However, when our troops moved in, confident the threat had been dealt with, they fell into an ambush suffering casualties. The failed bombing mission has lowered morale and brought questions into whether we can trust Royal Air Force claims of success and intelligence."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.10.d:0 "The Imamate of Oman started its resistance against the sultan after it felt their autonomy was being encroached upon. They also believed future oil exploration would syphon the wealth of the area to the sultan and the British. Despite their resistance and guerrilla tactics, the sultan of Oman has triumph and announced the Imamate of Oman has now been integrated into his sultanate. The success of the sultan was due in large part to the aid he received from oil interests and the British government. British advisors and the Royal Air Force proved decisive in allowing the poorly armed military of the sultan to triumph."
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.11.d:0 "The Imamate of Oman started its resistance against the sultan after it felt their autonomy was being encroached upon. They also believed future oil exploration would syphon the wealth of the area to the sultan and the British. The resistance and guerilla tactics proved extremely frustrating for the poorly armed and led military of the sultan. Despite the support of British advisors and the Royal Air Force, the sultan could not suppress the rebels. Indeed, the successful resistance inspired other Arab nationalists and anti-imperialists across Oman to sympathize with the rebels. Once the forces of the Imamate began to operate within the Sultanate of Oman, these supporters joined the Imamate fighters and eventually the sultan was overthrown. With this victory, the Imamate of Oman has taken control of the country and Arabs across the region see it as a victory over international imperialism."
 
 OMA_Jebel_Adkhar.12.d:0 "The Sultan of Imam, the British government, and international petroleum companies were eager to explore the interior of Oman for oil. However, the autonomous Imamate of Oman were resistant to any effort it perceived as violating its autonomy. With British backing, the Sultan decided he would send soldiers to seize key areas and petroleum prospectors to determine the full potential of the region. This led to an initial occupation of Imamate lands by the sultan. Recently however, the forces of the Omani sultan are facing guerilla strikes from fighters loyal to the Imam, turning the conflict into an armed struggle over the interior of Oman and control over its natural resources. The British back the sultan while Arab nationalists and rival Arab oil states support the Imamate in its struggle against the sultan."

 ERI_Eritrean_War.1.d:0 "As the oppression of Eritrea continues, a number of Christians in our lands have increasingly begun to join the cause. These supporters initially feared Muslim domination but now see an independent Eritrea is preferable to the current foreign regime. The Ethiopians are also desperate for local help and have relied on the Christians in the past. We have used this to our advantage in a recent operation where several Christian supporters joined the Ethiopian government as support staff at important administrative and military facilities. So far, these men have provided intelligence regarding Ethiopian strategy, policies, and troop movements."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.2.d:0 "As the oppression of Eritrea continues, a number of Christians in our lands have increasingly begun to join the cause. These supporters initially feared Muslim domination but now see an independent Eritrea is preferable to the current foreign regime. However, it appears we were tricked as an attempt to place several Christian supporters with the Ethiopians ended in failure. It appears one of the men quickly defected and began sending us false information, leading us to waste resources or suffer lives in fruitless operations. Once we had figured out his double game, he led his Ethiopian handlers to arrest our other agents, making the operation a major failure in intelligence gathering."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.3.d:0 "When a patrol of Ethiopian troops arrived to enter a military camp, our commander successfully ambushed the group, attacking them from multiple sides. The Ethiopian troops suffered casualties or ran from the battle. Our men were able to move in and quickly capture abandoned arms and ammunition before slipping away. By the time the Ethiopian military could muster a large enough force to fight back, our fighters were long gone."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.4.d:0 "An overly confident commander of ours made a costly blunder. In recent engagements his men had attacked several police checkpoints, easily driving off police officials and capturing their weapons. However, he decided to target a military checkpoint and his brazen approach left his men exposed. The Ethiopian troops did not immediately abandon their posts but held their position and inflicted heavy casualties among our men. Although the commander claimed to have inflicted even more casualties on the enemy, it is clear the attempted attack had been a blunder."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.5.d:0 "The Ethiopians illegal occupation of Eritrea took a large blow today after a group of our supporters blew up a municipal building in a large town. The structure had been built after the Ethiopian occupation and many Ethiopians brought to illegally administer our people utilized the building. Casualties are yet unknown, but the attack has already led some Ethiopians residing in the town to begin preparations to leave. With this success we have shown the people will not tolerate foreign occupation."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.6.d:0 "An attempt to bomb an Ethiopian military base ended in abject failure. Our men thought they could infiltrate the base from a poorly lit section of the perimeter but once inside they were immediately captured by a patrol. We expect the Ethiopians to harshly punish our men and expect them to publicize their success. The failure of this mission has weakened morale and hurt our standing with the population as we have been claiming our men can never be captured."
 
 ETH_Eritrean_War.1.d:0 "Historically, the many Eritrean clans have long been rivals of one another, indeed the initial independence movement was plagued by numerous factions and infighting. Although the rebels now appear much more unified, these old rivalries have persisted. To exploit this advantage our intelligence operatives recently approached a clan which covets a higher position within the rebel movement. They have agreed to provide us valuable intelligence on their rival and undermine the operations of that clan in exchange for cash and access to education and healthcare abroad. With this information we have successfully uprooted rebels from a key area. The clan has also agreed that it will advocate for a resolution to the conflict and minimize rebel activities in its areas."

Although the rebels now appear much more unified, these old rivalries have persisted. We attempted to do an operation in which our intelligence operatives approached a clan with offers of cash and access to healthcare and education abroad. In return the clan would give us vital intelligence on its rivals and guarantee they would reduce rebel activities as they became more prominent. However, this recent operation proved a failure, the clan collected cash from us and then seized our operatives. We believe they are being intensely interrogated and fear some of our intelligence assets within the rebel camp will soon be purged."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.3.d:0 "The Eritrean forces continue to conduct cowardly hit and run strikes and hide amongst civilians. However, in a recent operation a bold commander led our forces in a great victory over the enemy. The commander identified a village from which the attacks were coming and in a lighting raid he unleased mortars and heavy weapons as the infantry assaulted. The shock of the attack squashed any attempt at resistance and the village was quickly cleared of rebels. When faced with the might of the Ethiopian Army, the Eritrean fighters stand no chance."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.4.d:0 "A unit of our forces decided to assault a suspected Eritrean rebel camp. The united decided to use trucks in order to catch the enemy off-guard. However, the Eritreans appeared to have been prepared for our approach. The men met an enemy minefield and then had to advance on foot. By the then the enemy was notified of our plans and had dug in. We took heavy casualties before reaching the camp. However, by then the enemy had withdrawn and taken all their valuables with them, making the attack a costly mistake."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.5.d:0 "The Eritreans increasingly move with impunity and that has been to our advantage. An Air Force fighter observed a large movement of men in vehicles. We identified them as a rebel convoy and a group of fighters modified for bombing missions struck the convoy. The damage was immense and when a patrol reached the site, they found we had destroyed a convoy carrying men and heavy weapons. Intercepting this convoy will aid our troops in their efforts to dislodge the Eritrean rebels."
 ETH_Eritrean_War.6.d:0 "An army unit reported it had taken fire from an Eritrean rebel strongpoint and called on air support. We dispatched fighters who hit the reported target, however, it appears the bombs fell on a deserted field and managed to destroy a civilian farm equipment. There are no reported casualties and if there are, they are unlikely to be rebels. We suspect the unit that reported taking fire may have heard a loud noise from the farm itself and panicked, thankfully their coordinates did not hit the farmhouse itself. This operation proved to be a waste of resources and the rebels have been spreading rumors that our forces are bombing ghosts."
 
 ERI_Eritrean_War.10.d:0 "The Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) emerged as the premier anti-Ethiopian and Eritrean nationalist group following the unilateral annexation of Eritrea by Ethiopia. They fought the occupation initially with outdated arms or makeshift weapons, but overtime acquired more sophisticated arms and tactics. Yet despite their efforts, the Ethiopian military has managed to not only withstand their guerrilla tactics but following a series of victories they have largely uprooted the ELF. Resistance across Eritrea has largely ended and even street protests have stopped. It appears the people of Eritrea recognize Ethiopia is here to stay and to resist only invites more punishment. Whether Ethiopia can transition this military occupation into a proper administrative area will have to be seen. A failure to do so may invite more unrest in the future but for now Ethiopia has crushed the ELF."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.11.d:0 "After years of struggling, first against Italian colonialism, then the occupation of British and eventually Ethiopian rule, the people of Eritrea can finally be independent. Under the leadership of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), the Eritrean people looked past their own internal conflicts to unite in their mission to drive off the yoke of Ethiopian rule. This was achieved following a series of military victories and a recognition from the Ethiopian government that continued warfare would not result in a victory. Now that Eritrea has taken its place as an independent state, many will observe to see if the factionalism which plagues the region will return in full force."
 ERI_Eritrean_War.15.d:0 "The people of Eritrea long resented how Ethiopia seized control of their land long after their Italian colonial masters had been removed. The establishment of Ethiopian customs, governance, and people were seen as a fundamental threat to the Eritrean way of life. The early Eritrean independence movement had been riddled with internal strife, but following the annexation, these clans and factions must now unite as the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The war began with the Battle of Adal. A group of Eritrean resistance fighters, poorly armed and without proper leadership, managed to defeat and drive off Ethiopian police and military personnel from Adal. Many Eritreans now flock to join the ELF, but the Ethiopian government is also mobilizing its own forces to deal with the unrest."

 Yemeni_Coup.1.d:0 "The struggle between the Nasserist faction and royalist faction within Yemen has led to a coup attempt by Nasserist military officers. During the night, Colonel Abdullah Sallal, the head of the Palace Guard, successfully organized military forces in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. They seized the radio station, key government buildings, and launched an armed assault against the royal palace, to capture or kill the ruler of Yemen, Imam Muhammad al-Badr. After a brief but violent struggle, the royalist forces in the capital were defeated. Colonel Sallal announced Yemen would be a republic led by the revolutionary Free Officer group that will modernize Yemen along Nasserist lines. Egypt has already its support for the regime. Although the new regime declared al-Badr dead, news has reached Sanaa that al-Badr is rallying tribal support and is said to be moving towards Saudi Arabia to mobilize supporters."

 UAR_Insurgency_Options.1.d:0 "Along one of the major transportation routes where we have established a military outpost, our troops noted the suspicious movement of people into a nearby village. When we confirmed the presence of royalist fighters, we dispatched a unit. They launched heavy firepower to shock the enemy and then the infantry assaulted the village. The attack was a success as a royalist band of fighters were defeated. We captured weapons, supplies, and documents from the village. Our firepower and expertise have awed the local people and they will know not to challenge our presence. These operations will help us secure the major transportation routes and suffocate the resistance."
 UAR_Insurgency_Options.2.d:0 "An ambitious but foolish officer decided to lead his men outside our operating base to a nearby mountain pass to target a suspected royalist concentration. He did not seek to gather more intelligence or secure more support weapons and instead his attack led his forces into a royalist trap. Royalist forces managed to ambush our men, attack them form multiple sides and drive us back. The losses and defeat our forces took has hurt morale. Our forces in the area are said to be staying around the base and we fear royalist supporters maybe using this particular route with little harassment."
 UAR_Insurgency_Options.5.d:0 "One of our recon planes patrolling the border with Saudi Arabia identified a concentration of fighters moving into Yemen. A couple of modified close-air support aircraft then strafed and bombed the suspected royalist force. We sent a patrol to investigate the site and they confirmed the operation had been a major success and the royalist force had been neutralized. Our forces in Yemen are operating far from our home base and lack the heavy ground weapons. Luckily airpower has acted as an effective substitute for this."
 UAR_Insurgency_Options.6.d:0 "One of our recon planes patrolling the border with Saudi Arabia identified a small concentration of fighters based near the border. A couple of modified close-air support aircraft then strafed and bombed the suspected royalist force. However, when we sent a patrol to investigate the site, we discovered they were forces from our Yemeni allies. Naturally, many in Yemen are angry at our error and rumors have started that we had intentionally attacked those men. This unfortunately was an accident, we had not been aware of the deployment of a small force to intercept infiltrators from the border. Trust for our airpower has been eroded by this failure."
 UAR_Insurgency_Options.3.d:0 "The royalists and their allies rely on ignorance and bribery to maintain their forces and combat operations. There are some within their ranks, especially among the tribes who can easily be persuaded to support us. Our intelligence operatives successfully convinced a royalist tribal leader to minimize royalist rebel activity in his lands and provide us intelligence on royalist operations. He did so in exchange for cash and the building of a school and hospital within his land. So far, the intelligence provided has been excellent and we have curbed royalist activity in the area."

There are some within their ranks, especially among the tribes who can easily be persuaded to support us. Our intelligence operatives approached a royalist tribal leader and he agreed to offer intelligence and reduce royalist activity in exchange for large sums of cash. We had been making regular payments and getting intelligence reports. However, we recently discovered the intelligence he gave was often bogus or distracted our forces as the royalists made more significant moves. Apparently, the tribal leader was playing us, collecting cash from us as he continued to work against our forces. The operation to recruit him for intelligence gathering was a failure."

 YEM_Insurgency_Options.1.d:0 "Our forces identified a tribe in the area which was fighting with the royalists and offering them shelter. One of our units moved into position during the night to intercept traffic from where the rebels were hiding. In the morning, the royalist fighters fell into the trap and were cutdown by the ambush we setup. This victory not only reduced royalist activity in the area and raise morale but allowed our forces to crackdown on the tribe as we had clear evidence of their support for the royalists."
 YEM_Insurgency_Options.2.d:0 "An operation to uproot and destroy a royalist encampment ended in disaster. Our force had intelligence of a royalist camp nearby and we dispatched forces to attack it. However, the commander failed to gain the support of the local sheikh and the route he took ended up being very difficult terrain. This slowed the pace of our forces considerably and the royalists saw we were coming. Even though our unit began taking sniper fire and it was clear we no longer had the element of surprise, the commander moved on and at a certain point faced a large enemy ambush as royalist reinforcements. We took casualties and were forced to retreat. Morale in the area has dropped and some troops are reluctant to leave their outposts."
 YEM_Insurgency_Options.5.d:0 "The pride of our new nation is the modern air force we are building. We have acquired planes from friendly states who have also given our pilots quick courses to get them in the sky quickly. In a recent successful operation, our pilots managed to bomb a suspected royalist village. Aerial reconnaissance earlier identified the village had artillery and other heavy weapons being assembled. When a patrol went to investigate the bombing, they confirmed the destruction of heavy equipment and captured documents from royalist forces who had fled after the successful strike. The operation has raised the spirits of our armed forces."
 YEM_Insurgency_Options.6.d:0 "The pride of our new nation is the modern air force we are building. We have acquired planes from friendly states who have also given our pilots quick courses to get them in the sky quickly. In a recent operation, it appears our quick training courses may have led to an embarrassment. One of our bases near a key road junction came under heavy enemy fire. We sent out several fighters to bomb and force the attacking royalists to withdraw, however, it appears the pilots were unprepared for this mission. None of their bombs hit the enemy and the few strafing runs they did were against our own forces. The royalists are already describing the incompetency of our air force and this event has hurt morale. We will send some pilots for more training immediately."
 YEM_Insurgency_Options.3.d:0 "As the royalists continue their campaign, the tribal leaders and elders who back them are slowly realizing they are doing all the fighting while the monarch lives off their sacrifice. They are also aware of the reforms and advancements we offer them and in a recent intelligence operation we used this to our advantage. Our agents convinced a senior tribal leader to stop supporting the insurgency and to support our efforts in exchange for development aid for his people. The tribal leader informed us of local sympathizers, royalist movements, tactics, and strategy. With this information we will uproot the royalists present in the area."
 YEM_Insurgency_Options.4.d:0 "As the royalists continue their campaign, the tribal leaders and elders who back them are slowly realizing they are doing all the fighting while the monarch lives off their sacrifice. They are also aware of the reforms and advancements we offer them and in a recent intelligence operation we used this to our advantage. Our agents convinced a royal advisor to begin sending us information regarding royalist tactics, morale, and strategy. However, it turned out the advisor convinced our agents that they should betray the republic and join the royalist cause. This was not an ideological conversion we believe but a financial one. Working together they fed us false information, weakening our forces and before our agents finally defected, they stole many documents. This attempt at acquiring intelligence assets among the royalists was a failure."

 MUK_Insurgency_Options.1.d:0 "One of our tribal allies familiar with an area managed to lead a group of our fighters to attack a republican military base from an unguarded side. The troops at the base assumed the terrain was so harsh no one would attempt an entry from that side, but our forces managed it and launched an assault on the base. We inflicted many casualties, captured weapons, supplies, ammunition, and quickly withdrew with minimal losses. The republicans and their allies stay hunkered in their bases in fear."
 MUK_Insurgency_Options.2.d:0 "A daring operation turned into a defeat when one of our commanders identified a convoy of republican vehicles moving down a road. An ambush was setup to attack the vehicle however, the commander in charge of the ambush is not a trained officer. He is the son of a highly respected tribal leader and his ambush turned out to be poorly designed. The enemy vehicles easily withstood the attack and counter-attacked. Our forces took heavy casualties while inflicted very little. The failure has hurt morale among the men, some of whom now look to their leaders with distrust."
 MUK_Insurgency_Options.5.d:0 "The republicans and no doubt a foreign friend have setup an airfield near a key region of conflict. During the night, our forces utilized routes provided by local allies to setup mortars and other artillery pieces outside the base. Just before morning our guns opened fire, raining artillery on the base for several minutes before we quickly withdrew. Men reported hearing explosions and could see smoke rising as they left. The attack hit some fuel and ammunition dumps and we believe some valuable equipment was also destroyed, though the republicans have not admitted to this."
 MUK_Insurgency_Options.6.d:0 "An attempt to move some mortars and light artillery against a republican military checkpoint ended in failure. Apparently, the route our forces took was being watched by the enemy and when the mortar teams neared their positions to target the checkpoint they were ambushed by republican forces. We took some casualties but more significantly, the republicans seized a number of our mortars. This failure has hurt morale among the men and raised fears that a local tribe may have tipped the enemy off that we would use that route."
 MUK_Insurgency_Options.3.d:0 "The unjust seizure of power by the republicans has weighed heavily on officers who were not directly involved in the coup. Although they served the republic, some still hold their pledges of fealty the monarchy seriously. We successfully approached a midlevel officer and he agreed to provide us with valuable intelligence on troop movements, morale, and strategy in exchange for a promotion once we are returned to power. So far, we have gained valuable intelligence and are also spreading misinformation within republican forces, making the operation a major success."
 MUK_Insurgency_Options.4.d:0 "The unjust seizure of power by the republicans has weighed heavily on officers who were not directly involved in the coup. Although they served the republic, some still hold their pledges of fealty the monarchy seriously. However, in a recent intelligence operation to turn a republican officer into an informant ended in failure. Our agent successfully approached the officer and began gathering intelligence from him, however, the officer was apparently already under suspicion from his commanders. The intelligence we got was fake and we acted on it confirming their suspicions. Our agent and the officer were both detained and we fear several more informants may be purged in the coming days."

 NYCW.1.d:0 "The Nasserist coup in Sanaa had not been entirely a success. Colonel Abdullah Sallal and his fellow Free Officers had sought to transform Yemen into a republic and end the monarchy during the coup. Although they did capture the capital, secure other major towns and cities, and announced their program for modernizing Yemen, they failed in neutralizing the Yemeni monarch, Mohammad al-Badr. Al-Badr escaped the palace as Nasserist forces assaulted it and he was able to rally the large, rural tribal population to support him. With his traditional base now mobilized, al-Badr has decided to launch a guerilla war, with the backing of anti-Nasserist nations, in order to overthrow Sallal who has proclaimed himself President of Yemen. If the Free Officers and President Sallal are to achieve their vision for Yemen, they will have to deal with the royalist threat."
 NYCW.10.d:0 "\nThe strategy of securing the borders, controlling supply lines, and pacifying the royalist tribes proved to be ultimately successful for the republican government. The royalists relied heavily on the traditional base of support for the monarchy, the rural tribes of Yemen. Securing the borders cut off the royalists from receiving aid from other Arab monarchist states. Controlling the key transportation and supply routes allowed the republicans to observe enemy movement and eventually cripple the ability of the royalists to move freely. Finally, the pacification program led to rural development and turned a number of the pro-monarchy tribes to defect to the republican cause. Ultimately the victory vindicates the Arab nationalist ideology and the revolutionary fervor unleashed in southern Arabia now has a base from which to expand."
 NYCW.11.d:0 "With the final remnants of the republican forces surrendering to royalist commanders, Imam Mohammad al-Badr returned to the capital Sanaa. He arrived for the first time since the republican coup which drove him out of the capital and started the war. His forces had waged a series of successful operations to finally defeat the Free Officers of Yemen and restore his rule. Although the republicans controlled the cities and had access to sophisticated weaponry, al-Badr proved adept in mobilizing rural support for his cause and his forces knowledge of the terrain and people proved decisive in their campaigns. With the republican cause crushed, many believe the Nasserist influence in Yemen and even the region may soon disappear."

 KURD_SIX_DAY.1.d:0 "The government of Kurdistan is faced with a potential opportunity. With Damascus engaged in a war against Israel, its border with Kurdistan is hardly defended. Senior military commanders believe Kurdish forces can swiftly liberate the historical Kurdish lands of Hasakah and fortify them well before the Syrians can respond. Even if the Syrians refuse to accept the situation, the conflict in Israel and its aftermath will prevent Syria from dispatching overwhelming force to Hasakah. The military commanders believe the Syrians will eventually just accept the situation. Others in the cabinet warn such a military adventure will alienate all neighboring states with sizeable Kurdish populations and risk leaving the country isolated diplomatically. However, there is a strong desire among the population that it is the mission of Kurdistan to unite all Kurdish people."
 KURD_SIX_DAY.2.d:0 "The armed forces of Kurdistan successfully crossed the border and occupied Hasakah. Syrian border guards were too small in number to offer effective resistance and the opposition was defeated. As the Kurdish troops advanced, they were met with local Kurds who came in droves to cheer their liberators. The Kurdish government since independence had established ties with these communities and those investments had paid off. With Hasakah occupied and Kurdish forces dug-in, the Syrian government announced it would not challenge the action. It declared Kurdistan traitors of the faith and backstabbers for their actions but added the struggle against Zionism is the principle objective of the Syrian people. The government in Kurdistan announced it had successfully liberated the Syrian Kurds and were on their way to achieving the unification of all Kurds. The neighbors of Kurdistan were not impressed by such statements and have condemned the action."
 KURD_SIX_DAY.3.d:0 "When the military of Kurdistan launched its surprise invasion of Hasakah, it had calculated Syrian resistance would be minimal due to its ongoing war with Israel. However, this proved to be a miscalculation as Syrian resistance halted the Kurdish advance. Although many Syrian Kurds came out to support their liberators, the Syrian resistance inspired the non-Kurdish residents to openly join the resistance. With the situation becoming protracted, the Kurdistan government announced it will withdraw from Hasakah but added it will never forget its sacred mission to unify all Kurds. Many Syrian Kurds, fearing reprisals, are evacuating with these forces, highlighting the failure of the operation. The Syrian government was jubilant in its response stating they had thwarted a traitorous plot to stab the nation in the back. They added that this success in Hasakah reflects the victorious spirit of the Syrian people and their inevitable march to victory against all enemies."

 Rawanduz_Campaign.1.d:0 "The Kurdistan War was not proceeding as the Iraqi government had hoped. Despite possessing superior firepower and large troop numbers, Iraqi forces were frequently bogged down by the guerrilla tactics of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). The KDP knew the terrain well and enjoyed local support. The Iraqi military has decided to launch a massive operation in Rawanduz to crush the KDP and turn the tide against the rebels. Securing Rawanduz will destroy a huge base for the KDP and help the Iraqis cutoff supplies to the KDP coming from abroad. The Iraqi government is confident that if it commits a large enough force, the KDP will be unable to resist. The plan calls for nine Iraqi brigades to split into two forces and make a large pincer to trap and destroy the Kurdish rebels"
 Rawanduz_Campaign.2.d:0 "Disastrous news has reached Baghdad today regarding Iraqi military operations during the Rawanduz Campaign. Although the offensive was going well, over the past two days news has reached us that an entire brigade of our forces was wiped out by Kurdish rebel fighters of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). The brigade commander decided to establish a camp at a valley between Mount Handrin and Mount Zozik. However, he failed to setup posts in the surrounding hills and mountains, with the Kurdish fighters took advantage of. Using these heights, they annihilated the brigade, inflicting thousands of casualties, while capturing thousands. The survivors are said to have deserted, leaving nothing of the brigade intact. This defeat has broken the morale of our attacking forces and the order has been given to halt the offensive.  The Rawanduz Campaign has become a humiliating defeat and few will ever forget the disaster that was the Battle of Mount Handrin."
 Rawanduz_Campaign.3.d:0 "The Iraqi commander of the Rawanduz Campaign has radioed Baghdad to declare the pincer movement was a success. Several thousand Kurdish fighters were caught trapped and our forces were able to surround and destroy them with their overwhelming superiority in firepower and men. With this victory we have cleansed the region of Kurdish rebels and more significantly have cut off their access to foreign aid. The tide of the war has shifted in our favor. Now Kurdish fighters must struggle to recover their losses and replenish their supplies. The government has already announced it will be handing out a series of awards in recognition for this offensive and the confidence of the Iraqi military has never been higher."

 Iraqi_Kurdish_War.11.d:0 "The Iraqi government and the Kurdish Democratic Party officially signed an agreement ending the Kurdish War. The Iraqis have agreed to recognize Kurdistan as an independent country. As the treaty was signed, the last convoys of Iraqi troops left the borders of Kurdistan. Despite a series of offensives and bitter fighting, the KDP fighters emerged victorious. The Iraqi military was hindered by poor leadership and a reliance on conscript soldiers unmotivated to fight in a land that was hostile to them. In contrast the KDP fighters were highly motivated and were fighting in their own lands, successfully mobilizing support and using the terrain against the Iraqis. Although the initial motivation for the KDP was autonomy, the violent Iraqi response and the major victories convinced the KDP to instead seize independence. Kurdistan joins the world as a new nation and has promised to be a homeland for Kurds across the region."

 Iraqi_Kurdish_War.0.d:0 "Following the Iraqi Revolution, the new government reconciled with the popular Kurdish leader and rebel Mustafa Barzani. Barzani soon became the head of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) with advocated for autonomy as promised by the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government grew concerned over the KDP as it stroked unrest among the Kurds over the failure to receive autonomy. An attempt by the Iraqi government to use rival Kurdish tribes to defeat Barzani ended in failure and the KDP soon expelled Iraqi government officials from Kurdistan. The Iraqis mobilized its military and returned to Kurdistan. Quickly engaging in intense fighting with the KDP which melted its forces into the mountains and towns to wage a protracted guerrilla war against the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government must now deal with an enemy operating in difficult terrain and with strong local support."
 Iraqi_Kurdish_War.12.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) has for years resisted Iraqi military offensives and consistently demanded a recognition of Kurdish autonomy from Baghdad. The Iraqi government has finally acknowledged it had failed in destroying the KDP or asserting its dominance in Kurdistan and has signed an accord with the KDP, guaranteeing the autonomy of Kurdistan. With the autonomy of Kurdistan secured, the KDP announced it will begin the process of rebuilding Kurdistan and the toll the war has had on the population. The Iraqi government sought to downplay their capitulation to Kurdish demands stating the new agreement reflected the desire for peace among Iraqis and showed the world the commitment of Iraq to national reconciliation. The Iraqi government added the agreement was not between Iraqis and Kurds but an agreement among Iraqi brothers. Despite these statements, internationally, the agreement is seen as a victory for the KDP against the Iraqi government."
 Iraqi_Kurdish_War.10.d:0 "The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) signed an agreement capitulating to the Iraqi government. The KDP began the war by expelling Iraqi officials after crushing an attempt by pro-Iraqi Kurds to assert authority in Kurdistan. The resulting conflict saw the Iraqi military launch major offensives to uproot and defeat the KDP. After a series of successful operations, the KDP soon realized the situation was hopeless and have agreed to surrender. In a statement, the Iraqi government noted its victory showcases the dominance, professionalism, and zeal of the Iraqi military. More importantly, it unifies Iraq and shows the world that Iraqi unity can never be challenged through the use of proxy groups like the KDP. This round of fighting has ended in the favor of Iraq. However, there are many who fear that if the government brings back its heavy-handed policies to the province it will risk alienating the Kurds in the future."

 KUR_Insurgency_Options.1.d:0 "Our fighters successfully raided an Iraqi military base yesterday. While most of the Iraqi forces were out doing a large-scale sweep, our forces easily slipped out and assaulted the base from which they operated. The Iraqi forces present offered little resistance, most either fleeing or surrendering as our men quickly took over. We destroyed equipment, captured documents, supplies, and weapons. All this will aid in our struggle and strike fear into the Iraqi conscripts who Baghdad has sent against us. The commander of our fighters, while leading the men back to their safe haven, managed to even ambush a small detachment of Iraqi troops who had moved too far away from the main force."
 KUR_Insurgency_Options.2.d:0 "A recent disaster fell one of our commanders. He had scouted an Iraqi outpost near his area of operation. The post appeared to be lightly manned and meant as an observation point. Its distance from the main body of Iraqi forces made the commander think the Iraqis had made a tactical blunder and he could take it with little effort. However, when his troops moved to assault the outpost, they did not find terrified Iraqi conscripts, instead the outpost was manned by Iraqi light infantry commandos. They held their ground and inflicting heavy casualties on our forces. Our men managed to withdraw but the heavy casualties and failed raid has lowered morale in the sector. The emboldened Iraqi commandos are now patrolling the area openly."
 KUR_Insurgency_Options.5.d:0 "One of our urban cells operating in a large village successfully bombed an Iraqi government building yesterday. The brave fighters had observed the building lacked enough security and during the night managed to place explosives inside. The bombing already has led Iraqi government workers in the town to flee back to Baghdad or stay at home. We must continue to show the people of Kurdistan that we will not tolerate the interference of the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government is already trying to bring these officials back and assert the situation in Kurdistan is normal, but actions like these highlight the falseness of such assertions."
 KUR_Insurgency_Options.6.d:0 "Members of an urban cell of our fighters were rounded up by the Iraqi Army yesterday. They had planned to bomb a building being used by the Army as a base in one of the larger towns. However, the Iraqis had suspected they were being canvassed by several of our men and when the cell returned to plant the explosives, they were detained by the Iraqis. The men were quickly tortured and tried by a military court. In addition, the Iraqis are highlighting how much explosives they seized and are claiming the KDP cares nothing for the Kurdish civilians who would have been killed in the area. This negative propaganda hurts the cause."
 KUR_Insurgency_Options.3.d:0 "The Iraqi military consists of conscripts and poorly trained officers. They also come from outside Kurdistan and lack knowledge of the people or terrain. This is to the advantage of our group as our intelligence wing recently launched an operation to send Kurds to offer translation services to Iraqi forces in an area of operations. They are posing as members of pro-government tribes and the Iraqi Army so far has no idea. Our men are already reporting back excellent information on Iraqi troop numbers, movements, and tactics. In return our men are providing them old information and sending Iraqi formations into sweep operations that help facilitate the movement of our own personnel passed heavily fortified areas."
 KUR_Insurgency_Options.4.d:0 "The Iraqi military consists of conscripts and poorly trained officers. They also come from outside Kurdistan and lack knowledge of the people or terrain. This is to the advantage of our group as our intelligence wing recently launched an operation to send Kurds to offer translation services to Iraqi forces in an area of operations. They are posing as members of pro-government tribes, however, the operation proved to be a failure. Among the Iraqi forces in this area was an intelligence officer with experience in Kurdistan. He realized the ruse and following a series of tests was able to uproot our spies from the unit he was stationed with. This has hindered our intelligence gathering and the information they gained from the infiltrators will no doubt alert other Iraqi formations of our infiltration tactics and make them more difficult."
 IRQ_Insurgency_Options.1.d:0 "Our light infantry regiment scored an impressive victory over KDP fighters yesterday. As a nearby unity conducted a sweep operation, the light infantry troops observed evidence that a band of Kurdish fighters had slipped out. They tracked them to a small camp and proceeded to launch an assault. The enemy was unprepared as our men inflicted casualties and took prisoners. The survivors fled in terror. We gained intelligence and captured enemy weapons, headquarters will determine the origin of their weapons. The success has caused some in the upper command to question the use of large formations for sweeps and instead utilize smaller units with better trained personnel."
 IRQ_Insurgency_Options.2.d:0 "Our intelligence sources identified a KDP outpost on a mountain post. The commander on the ground thought the post looked small and believed an all-out assault would secure the position and strike fear into the enemy. However, this proved to be disastrous, as our men moved towards the post, the enemy inflicted huge casualties from their elevated positions. Many of our forces lost their nerve and began fleeing after it became clear the assault was floundering. The failure showcases the lack of tactical awareness of commanders and highlights the difficulties of using large conscript forces in such operations."
 IRQ_Insurgency_Options.5.d:0 "The Iraqi Air Force successfully bombed several enemy villages suspected of being KDP bases yesterday. They utilized recently acquired napalm munitions to completely devastate the enemy positions and showcase the overwhelming power of our forces. Due to enemy operations in the area, it was clear the villages were maintaining and hosting fighters in the nearby hills. Previous attempts to reach the villages with ground troops had ended in failure. An observer plane noted the targeted sites were largely eviscerated by the bombings and noted them as successful. Enemy operations in the area have noticeably declined. The local Kurds will now be less likely to support the KDP and the morale among the enemy has been weakened."
 IRQ_Insurgency_Options.6.d:0 "The Iraqi Air Force bombed an enemy position suspected of housing KDP fighters yesterday. The planes utilized recently acquired napalm munitions to completely devastate the enemy positions and showcase the overwhelming power of our forces. Following the bombing, a ground patrol arrived but was met with hostile crowds. Apparently, our pilots had targeted the wrong site and hit an area controlled by pro-government Kurds. Those villagers reacted angrily to our men and it appears we have lost support among the local population which will hinder future operations in the area."
 IRQ_Insurgency_Options.3.d:0 "The KDP has long viewed our military as incompetent and incapable in terms of personnel and tactics. However, our intelligence services have long been engaged in operations of infiltration and intelligence gathering. Recently, one of our intelligence officers successfully implemented a policy to have pro-Iraqi Kurdish supporters join local KDP bands. So far, the operation has been a success and they are feeding us intelligence on KDP tactics, equipment, supply situation, and even support the local fighters are receiving from our foreign enemies. More successful operations like this will allow us to undermine and eventually uproot all the KDP bands in Iraq."

The operation had been a major success, however, the local military commander decided to directly act on this intelligence and launched a series of successful operations in his area. Although the commander received a promotion, his blatant disregard in trying to protect our assets raised the suspicions of the KDP and they captured our infiltrators. We have not just lost key sources of intelligence but now the KDP will learn how we infiltrated them and future operations will be much more difficult to implement."
