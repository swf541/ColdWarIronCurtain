 HOL_carrier_hull_light_4_short:0 "JLSS"
 HOL_carrier_hull_light_0_desc:0 "The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was a light aircraft carrier design created by the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and used by eight naval forces between 1944 and 2001. They were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards to serve as an intermediate step between the expensive, full-size fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers."
 HOL_carrier_hull_light_1_desc:0 "HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81) (Dutch; Hr.Ms. Karel Doorman (R81)) was a Colossus-class aircraft carrier of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Formerly the British ship HMS Venerable, she was sold to the Netherlands in 1948 as a light attack carrier. In 1960, she was involved in the decolonization conflict in Western New Guinea with Indonesia. In the mid 1960s the role was changed to anti-submarine warfare carrier and only ASW aircraft and helicopters were carried."
 HOL_carrier_hull_light_2_desc:0 "After the 1964 refit, Karel Doorman served the rest of her career mostly conducting NATO anti-submarine patrols in the north Atlantic, no longer carrying strike or fighter aircraft as part of her regular air wing. Karel Doorman also regularly conducted various exercises near Scotland during her career."
 HOL_carrier_hull_light_3_desc:0 "The Enforcer design resulted in the Dutch navy building the HNMLS Rotterdam, and as in improved design the HNMLS Johan de Witt. Both vessels are considered amphibious transport ships (also known as a Landing Platform, Dock, LPD) in the Royal Netherlands Navy."
 HOL_carrier_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The JLSS has 2,000 lane metres for transport of material such as tracked & wheeled vehicles or containers. She has an elevator and crane for up to 40 tons, a roll on/roll off facility for vehicles, and a steel beach stern construction for accommodating cargo transfer via landing craft. The ship is equipped with two LCVP's landing craft. For sea-basing operations she will have large helicopter deck with landing spots for operating two Chinooks simultaneously, and a hangar with a storage capacity of up to 6 medium-sized helicopters, including NH-90, AS-532 Cougar, CH-47F and AH-64D Apache."

In the Netherlands they are also known as "three cylinder" submarines."
 HOL_sub_hull_large_single_2:0 "Potvis Class"
 HOL_sub_hull_large_single_2_desc:0 "The Royal Netherlands Navy considered using nuclear propulsion for the second batch of Dolfijn-class submarines (so-called Potvis class) and therefore postponed in the late 1950s their construction to study the feasibility of building nuclear powered submarines, but in the end it was decided not to use nuclear propulsion for the Potvis-class submarines. This meant that both Potvis-class submarines were built with diesel-electric propulsion like her earlier sister ships."
 #HOL_sub_hull_large_single_3:0 "Rubis Class"
 #HOL_sub_hull_large_single_3_desc:0 "The Rubis class is a series of nuclear-powered attack submarines operated by the French Navy.
