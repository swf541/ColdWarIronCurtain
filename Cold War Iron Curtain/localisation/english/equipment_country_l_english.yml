The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

The M26 Pershing is notably heavy for a medium tank with an exceptionally poor off-road speed as a result of this. Its 8-cylinder Ford GAF engine could carry it up to 100 miles at 30 mph on road but off-road it clocks at 5.25 mph. Its main gun is a 90mm cannon and can wield a M2 browning. However, during the Korean war the .50 caliber M2 browning was swapped for 2 M1919 .30-06 guns due to the large quantity of soft targets in the field and the need to carry 9x the ammunition rather than more firepower. The M26 may have been a medium tank, but it is extremely heavy and can be considered to be a hybrid medium/heavy tank."

It has approximately 220mm of armor and carries a 105mm main gun. It typically used the M73 7.62x51mm machine gun as its secondary armament. The engine is an improved V12 twin-turbo engine that can move about the same speed as the M48. However, despite weighing slightly more than the M48, the M60 can move about the same speed and across the same difference. The M60 underwent many different minor changes throughout its life and has approximately 4 variants as a result of this.

 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "

It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

The hull itself is made of improved, thickened composite armor and comes with an improved smoothbore gun. It also can come equipped with a rocket armament for improved firepower. It has a smaller range than the T-72 and slightly slower speeds despite having a more advanced transmission and gas turbine engine.

The design was finished around 1990. The engine was replaced with a 12 cylinder diesel engine and was slower than even the T-80, but held much higher firepower. The gun was upgraded, the fire control system was improved, the armor was thickened substantial and many more auxiliaries were added including a ATGM jammer and smoke dischargers.

It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

 YUG_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

 VIE_mechanized_heavy_equipment_7_desc:0 "The M2 ODS Bradley is an improved variant of the Bradley developed by BAE systems in 1991. The ODS featured an optimized interior, explosive reactive armor, and a hydromechanical transmission. Although the reactive armor came at a cost and resulted in the Bradley being unable to swim. The ODS also added a better rangefinder, a navigation system, a missile countermeasure, and a thermal imaging system. Additionally, a very small food heater and comfort station was added which is credited as the best innovation by some."

It is capable of travelling 75 miles in water at an impressive swimming speed of 28.6 mph. The vehicle would have also featured an IFV style turret for added fire support. The exact armaments are unknown but it could potentially hold anything from autocannons to ATGMs. The project costed 3 billion to develop but was eventually cancelled as it was estimated to cost an additional 12 billion to create the remainder of what the vehicle was desired to do. It saw combat in the proving ground pool when a piece of it came off during testing and one of the designers, angry that it did this again, kicked it hard enough to break his foot. "

It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US."

It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

The M/39 was derived largely from the M28-30, but included some alterations proposed by the Army. The M/39 also incorporated a semi-pistol grip into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin-Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the Winter War, but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the Continuation War. Small numbers were also assembled from leftover parts in the late 1960s through 1970."

 VIE_protection_equip_4_desc: "Interceptor is the designation for the modern protective gear US military uses. It was designed in DARPA in 1998 and sought to provide protection that has not been afforded to infantry since armor first went out of date. Although it is not nearly as effective against gunfire as plate armor was against swords. The Interceptor body armor consists of the OTV, the DAPS, and the MICH. The OTV is the vest which protects the neck, throat, biceps, and groin. The auxiliaries can be removed from the torso protection. The OTV contains ballistic plates and modern nylon compounds that can protect soldiers greater than any armor prior. The system also comes with the ability to protect the soldier with a thin Flattening Load Carrier vest to make carrying equipment easier. The DAPS are auxiliary protective sleeves intended to protect the legs and arms. The MICH is a lightweight kevlar helmet that comes with auxiliary ports to hold different pieces of equipment such as binoculars. "

The ICTV and SFICTV began development in the early 2000s by a variety of manufacturers with only the IOTV being developed by 2007 and the helmet series currently in development or conceptual. The ICTV is set to include a full set of body armor protecting almost the entirety of the body with gaps protected with interlocking fiber layers and lightweight metal plates. The helmet comes with ear and eye protection with auxiliary support for a protective bulletproof assault gas mask and support for binoculars. The SF variant is much lighter with much of the plating scaled back or segmented to aid movement. When it is developed, it will provide complete protection."

It was a sniper version of the Type 99 rifle, chambered in the 7.7×58mm round. There were a few variations of the Type 99 sniper rifle, some with the straight bolt and the scope mounted on the left side of the receiver which allowed use of stripper clips. Another variation was one with a bent bolt and the scope above the receiver which required the sniper to load the rounds one at a time. The shorter barrel, combined with the larger caliber round made concealment more difficult than the Type 97 rifle that preceded it, considering the louder muzzle blast and flash caused by the increased powder capacity." # Kyūkyū-shiki sogeki-jū

 JAP_specialist_3_short: "Howa Type 64"
 JAP_specialist_3_desc: "Long range optics (scopes) can be installed on the Type 64 rifle so it can be deployed as a sniper rifle. Issuing a Type 64 sniper rifle is usually granted to the individual with the most accurate shooting proficiency in each division (a designated marksman). However, in many cases the individual may simply be issued the scope by itself to be used only during training exercises and shooting competitions, while no specific rifle is assigned to the individual himself.\nThe issued optics are usually set at 2.2× magnification and may either be a surplus M1C/D sniper rifle M84 scope used by the U.S. Military during World War II or a similar model produced by Nikon that replicates the M84's magnification levels. Performance is similar to the M1C/D sniper rifle but it is only possible to set the scope to view targets at 500 meters despite the elevation knob being labeled for up to 800 meters. In addition to this, the standard aiming reticule is a simple black \"T\" which makes it extremely difficult to use during twilight hours or on a black target.\nSome serious complaints about the accuracy of the sniper version are linked to the poorly conceived attachment system for the scope. The scope goes askew easily because it is only affixed with one screw. After the scope is mounted and the rifle is zeroed, it is imperative that it be handled carefully because it is easily jostled. Furthermore, since the scope is not usually assigned to any particular rifle it is often difficult to keep it static on any particular rifle's receiver. This is usually corrected by installing a piece of cloth between the receiver and scope mount, but then the iron sights of the rifle are obscured. In cases like this, it is necessary to install a cheek pad to properly align the users eye with the scope."
