The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

The M2 Bradley saw combat in every US conflict since its inception including Desert Storm. The M2 Bradley project was intended to create a new generation of PCs for the modern era complete with NBC protection. The project started in the late 60s and went through numerous prototypes to reach where it is now. The Bradley uses a VTA-903T 8-cylinder engine and has torsion bar suspension. The Bradley is armed with a 25mm autocannon and an anti-tank TOW attachment. BAE was tasked to create an infantry transport that was bae. Taking inspiration from the prototypes of the MICV project, the Bradley is capable of reconnaissance and support for the infantry that it carriers. Although it has aluminum armor, its firepower and mobility is used to protect itself in the field."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-44 is a medium Soviet tank made closer to the end of WWII. It provided improved mobility and greater armor with a heavier 85mm main gun. It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "

It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

The hull itself is made of improved, thickened composite armor and comes with an improved smoothbore gun. It also can come equipped with a rocket armament for improved firepower. It has a smaller range than the T-72 and slightly slower speeds despite having a more advanced transmission and gas turbine engine.

The design was finished around 1990. The engine was replaced with a 12 cylinder diesel engine and was slower than even the T-80, but held much higher firepower. The gun was upgraded, the fire control system was improved, the armor was thickened substantial and many more auxiliaries were added including a ATGM jammer and smoke dischargers.

It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

 YUG_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

The M24 has 38mm of armor and a 75mm main gun. The engine is a V8 twin Cadillac with a Hydramatic transmission that can move roughly the same as the M5 Stuart. In combat, the M5 Stuart's small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign.

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

The armor is an aluminum hull with a steel turret. It was immediately rushed into service in Vietnam because of its mobility and versatility where it served an exceptional role. The 152mm main gun can launch an ATGM or conventional ammunition respectively. The M551 was criticized by many of its operators due to the difficulty of use in direct combat but still served its role effectively despite its poor reputation."

The T15E2 gun mounted on this tank was much more powerful than the gun mounted on the Pershing, and similar to the T26E4 Super Pershing which utilized a similar experimental 90mm, the counterweight at the back of the turret was enlarged substantially to offset the long gun's weight."

The improved engine could carry it 295 miles at 23 mph and had significant mobility using the same fuel as the M103. There were also some minor other improvements made to the parts of the M103 such as a slightly different model of transmission but was ultimately the same. The M103A2 was the last heavy tank created by the US because main battle tanks supplanted the need for heavy tanks and could carry more firepower with less weight and more mobility."

The tank uses 2 tracks and a horizontal volute spring suspension. The T95 is equipped with a 105mm main gun and has a M2 Browning secondary armament. It was initially designed to break through German defenses and was later considered for the invasion of the Japanese mainland.

The R32 was designed to carry a nuclear powered electric engine and a 120mm main gun with 3 secondary MGs. The nuclear engine was estimated to give it a speed of 40 mph and an almost limitless travelling range as a result of nuclear power being its source of fuel. The armor was designed to be 127-254mm thick. The project was cancelled quickly after its inception due to a large number of hangups in the lack of technology needed to create the design and skepticism on behalf of the US General Staff in charge of funding the project."

It is propelled by a C4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine capable of transporting the vehicle at 22-30 mph over 100-150 miles before needing refueling. It was reliable, cheap to produce, and a logician's wet dream. It was very compact and easy to transport in large numbers which made shipping the vehicle across the Atlantic extremely easy.

 VIE_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M26 Pershing is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1944. It saw combat in WWII and in the Korean war. The M26 Pershing is notably heavy for a medium tank with an exceptionally poor off-road speed as a result of this. Its 8-cylinder Ford GAF engine could carry it up to 100 miles at 30 mph on road but off-road it clocks at 5.25 mph. Its main gun is a 90mm cannon and can wield a M2 browning. However, during the Korean war the .50 caliber M2 browning was swapped for 2 M1919 .30-06 guns due to the large quantity of soft targets in the field and the need to carry 9x the ammunition rather than more firepower. The M26 may have been a medium tank, but it is extremely heavy and can be considered to be a hybrid medium/heavy tank."

Additionally, shotguns can have improved usability in modern combat with HE rounds, 000 ammunition, flechette rounds, or incendiary shots."

 VIE_manpats_1_short: "M1 Bazooka"
 VIE_manpats_1_desc: "The M1 Bazooka is a recoilless anti-tank rocket developed in 1942 by Edward Uhl. More than 400000 units were created and it saw massive usage during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. The M1 Bazooka is one of the first rocket propelled anti-tank weapons. It could be used against bunkers, armored vehicles, machine gun nests, or tanks. Some copies of the M1 were captured by German forces quickly after being rolled out and they were reverse engineered to create the Panzerschreck. The M1 costs very little and overwhelming amounts of surplus ammunition were created so it was used in future wars and is still used by low-budget armies today. At its current rate of usage, the weapon will likely continue see combat by low-budget armies. However, with global development resulting in an increase in dedicated MICs and current conflicts running it out, it is not likely to see more for much longer."

 VIE_manpats_2_desc: "The M20A1 superbazooka is the summation of a large number of improvements made to the Bazooka by Edward Uhl throughout the war up and up to the mid 50s. It featured lightweight casts, auxiliary emplacement support, an optical sight, an extended range as a result of improved munition, an improved coupling mechanism, a magnetic trigger replacing the battery ignition, metal furniture, and can be broken down to aid in mobility and maintenance. The improvements made it a far more capable weapon than the M1 that could be used against stronger targets. It was used in the Korean war and many different conflicts beyond that by other countries."

 VIE_manpats_3_desc: "The M72 LAW is a 1 shot light anti-tank unguided rocket launcher developed by FA Spinale, CB Weeks, and PV Choate in 1963. It was introduced immediately to replace the bazooka in production and has seen combat in every US conflict since its inception. The weapon itself is very lightweight and enables regular infantry to carry and use it wherever needed. It is not reloadable but only weighs 5.5 pounds so even your grandma could use it. It has an effective range of 660 feet. The weapon has been used in the Afghanistan war, Iraq, Somalia, the Gulf War, and Vietnam."
 VIE_manpats_4: "M202 FLASH"
 VIE_manpats_4_short: "M202 FLASH"
 VIE_manpats_4_desc: "The M202 FLASH is a multishot incendiary rocket launcher designed in 1978 by a large ad-hoc team and used in the Vietnam war. It can be loaded with 66mm incendiary rockets that use TPA to ignite an area after explosion. It can burn far hotter than napalm and creates enough heat and smoke to force low flying helicopters to avoid an area. It can be used as an anti-tank weapon due to the tremendous heat it creates over a large area effectively roasting a vehicle's crew. Alternatively, the M202 can use the LAW's 66mm rockets if the operator needs it to use direct rockets rather than blanket an area in fire. It did not see official wide scale production, although several hundred of the prototype model were made and used in Vietnam. "

The weapon has seen combat in the Gulf war, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen. The M141 is a one-shot disposable anti-fortification weapon dedicated to bunker busting that has an effective range of 1200 yards but can be used to hit large targets further beyond. The M153 is a reusable weapon that fires HEAA or thermobaric rounds. The SMAW can collapse buildings and has a very large explosion radius. It, however, gives off a large bout of semi-toxic smoke making firing it from an enclosed space unsafe without gas protection. This issue would not be fixed until the SMAW II was developed. It has seen combat in the Gulf war, Afghanistan, and Iraq."

 VIE_manpads_1_desc: "The Redeye is an anti-air MANPADS that was created in 1959 by Convair to adapt to modern combat where jets could outrun or outtank anti-aircraft guns. It uses infrared to home into its target. In 1948, the US army began seeking new air defense weapons to replace ineffective guns. Many different concepts for fast moving rockets were investigated but ultimately none were accurate. In the mid 1950s, Convair began studying the use of infrared guidance to create a portable surface to air missile system. Convair began looking at early air-to-air missiles to create their weapon and managed to scale it down to a smaller level. The Redeye was used in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan."

 VIE_manpads_2_short: "Redeye II"
 VIE_manpads_2_desc: "The Redeye II is an anti-air MANPADS which was developed by General Dynamics in 1967. It uses an infrared homing surface to air missile to home in on its target. It featured a higher end computer and general improvements to parts and overall design to make it more reliable. Although the Redeye II was an improvement over the Redeye I it wasn't widely manufactured and remained a prototype as most of its improvements could simply be added to the Redeye I. It can be considered that developing the Redeye II in this context is improving the computer of the Redeye I and manufacturing the better equipment."

The Stinger A features a complete overhaul of the entire Redeye system and comes with a dual Infrared and UV seeker to better determine what is a countermeasure and what is the actual target. The Stinger A's ammunition contains a more potent mixture giving it more power than its predecessor and can reach a farther range. It demonstrated considerable power in the Falklands war, Afghanistan, Irani-Iraqi war, and many other middle eastern conflicts."

However, the Stinger B was scarcely produced at only 600 units. The Stinger C added more computer components, better software, and an adaptive system that can attempt to overcome interference by adjusting its modules to try to find the clearest visual. More than 20000 units were created and it saw combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Stinger project continues to be developed with new, minor additions being added and more variants being designated as minor improvements are created."

 VIE_protection_equip_1_desc: "During World War 2, the M12 flak jacket was used by the United States as a protective piece of armor that could absorb flak and small caliber rounds. It was, however, very cumbersome so most of the time, a soldier's only uniform was the cotton fiber Olive Drab uniform. Despite this, the M12 worked well in protecting soldiers from shrapnel assuming the shrapnel did not hit the vast space where the vest did not occupy./nThe M1 helmet was designed in 1941 by Major Sydenham of the US army. It was highly effective in deflecting shots that were vectored but not head on. It was used extensively during WW2 and became iconic."

The vest is nominally lightweight and has built in pockets to carry ammunition. It was also designed, with limited success, to insulate from heat.The M1952A would be replaced by the M1965A when kevlar was invented almost immediately. The M1A is an improvement over the M1 helmet with minor changes to the inside of the helmet so that it rests easier on the head."

It is far better at protecting infantry than the M1965A, which it replaced. Incorporating multiple layers of nylon, the PASGAT helmet and vest would be rolled out completely by 1983. However, despite being better for protection, PASGAT was extremely heavy, cumbersome, and very uncomfortable in extreme temperatures."

 VIE_protection_equip_4_desc: "Interceptor is the designation for the modern protective gear US military uses. It was designed in DARPA in 1998 and sought to provide protection that has not been afforded to infantry since armor first went out of date. Although it is not nearly as effective against gunfire as plate armor was against swords. The Interceptor body armor consists of the OTV, the DAPS, and the MICH. The OTV is the vest which protects the neck, throat, biceps, and groin. The auxiliaries can be removed from the torso protection. The OTV contains ballistic plates and modern nylon compounds that can protect soldiers greater than any armor prior. The system also comes with the ability to protect the soldier with a thin Flattening Load Carrier vest to make carrying equipment easier. The DAPS are auxiliary protective sleeves intended to protect the legs and arms. The MICH is a lightweight kevlar helmet that comes with auxiliary ports to hold different pieces of equipment such as binoculars. "

Currently, most of the pieces are in development or in the conceptual phase. The ICTV and SFICTV began development in the early 2000s by a variety of manufacturers with only the IOTV being developed by 2007 and the helmet series currently in development or conceptual. The ICTV is set to include a full set of body armor protecting almost the entirety of the body with gaps protected with interlocking fiber layers and lightweight metal plates. The helmet comes with ear and eye protection with auxiliary support for a protective bulletproof assault gas mask and support for binoculars. The SF variant is much lighter with much of the plating scaled back or segmented to aid movement. When it is developed, it will provide complete protection."

It was a sniper version of the Type 99 rifle, chambered in the 7.7×58mm round. There were a few variations of the Type 99 sniper rifle, some with the straight bolt and the scope mounted on the left side of the receiver which allowed use of stripper clips. Another variation was one with a bent bolt and the scope above the receiver which required the sniper to load the rounds one at a time. The shorter barrel, combined with the larger caliber round made concealment more difficult than the Type 97 rifle that preceded it, considering the louder muzzle blast and flash caused by the increased powder capacity." # Kyūkyū-shiki sogeki-jū

 JAP_specialist_3_desc: "Long range optics (scopes) can be installed on the Type 64 rifle so it can be deployed as a sniper rifle. Issuing a Type 64 sniper rifle is usually granted to the individual with the most accurate shooting proficiency in each division (a designated marksman). However, in many cases the individual may simply be issued the scope by itself to be used only during training exercises and shooting competitions, while no specific rifle is assigned to the individual himself.\nThe issued optics are usually set at 2.2× magnification and may either be a surplus M1C/D sniper rifle M84 scope used by the U.S. Military during World War II or a similar model produced by Nikon that replicates the M84's magnification levels. Performance is similar to the M1C/D sniper rifle but it is only possible to set the scope to view targets at 500 meters despite the elevation knob being labeled for up to 800 meters. In addition to this, the standard aiming reticule is a simple black \"T\" which makes it extremely difficult to use during twilight hours or on a black target.\nSome serious complaints about the accuracy of the sniper version are linked to the poorly conceived attachment system for the scope. The scope goes askew easily because it is only affixed with one screw. After the scope is mounted and the rifle is zeroed, it is imperative that it be handled carefully because it is easily jostled. Furthermore, since the scope is not usually assigned to any particular rifle it is often difficult to keep it static on any particular rifle's receiver. This is usually corrected by installing a piece of cloth between the receiver and scope mount, but then the iron sights of the rifle are obscured. In cases like this, it is necessary to install a cheek pad to properly align the users eye with the scope."
