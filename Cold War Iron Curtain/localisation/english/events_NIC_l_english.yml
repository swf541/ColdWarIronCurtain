 nic.5.d:0 "Coffee is on the most numerous exports of Nicaragua. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 19th century. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production requires significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws have therefore been passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. Profits from coffee production flows abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee are virtually nonexistent."
 nic.6.d:0 "Some civilians, several exiled Nicaraguan military personnel, and other active military personnel, who disagree with President Somoza Garcia have planned a coup d'état. Rumours say that even Emiliano Chamorro has something to do with this.\n\n On [GetDate] an ambush was set off on the Southern Managua highway with the intention of capturing President Somoza Garcia, on his way to Montelimar hacienda. It was planned and mounted by dissident officers of the National Guard together with a group of young conservatives and one or two liberals, who rejected Somoza's rule. When the capital hears about the coup, they hear that..."
 nic.7.d:0 "President Somoza has just informed me that two members National Guard were killed, one wounded today in attempt to assassinate him. Three truckloads arms and ammunition smuggled from Costa Rica with full knowledge Costa Rican officials especially Colonel Herrera of Civil Guard, the President claimed. Attempt made to ambush him last night on leaving reception my house but he told us then that he had been tipped off and guards ran men away from nearby city water tank. Today, two guardsmen attempted to stop suspicious truck on road to Montelimar but occupants opened fire. A motorcycle policeman joined the fray and he and one guardsman killed and the other guard wounded. Child passing by also killed. Assailants escaped but are believed to be surrounded. Somoza told Colonel Layton there were fourteen men in truck. Colonel Rogers says air force spotted abandoned truck containing ammunition and he learned some men in jeep were arrested in front my residence gate last night.\n\nPresident told Layton he was declaring martial law. President claims General Chamorro back of plot. Chamorro failed to appear in my reception last night which was unusual, Somoza then commenting on it."
 nic.8.d:0 "The plan was defeated and those involved were captured and Subsequently, most of these prisoners were taken to some coffee plantations in the Department of Carazo and cruelly executed, some few were left alive, taken to the military prisons of the Loma de Tiscapa, later tried in Council of War, those summarily executed were partially burned and buried in a common grave.\n\nA small group of rebels who had managed to escape from the trap set by the National Guard and who were heading towards the Costa Rican border on board a truck, were captured at Cuatro Esquinas and all were executed by troops commanded by Captain Agustín Peralta Ruiz.\n\nFaced with so much repression, many went into self-exile directly or took refuge in some embassy; the pacts were broken and General Emiliano Chamorro ordered the withdrawal of the conservative deputies and senators from the National Congress, but not all of them paid attention to him."
 nic.9.d:0 "The age of Anastasio Somoza Garcia has come to an sudden end when he was killed during a coup d'état, done by disgrunteled military and civilan personnel. In his place rises a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone, leading the Frente de Salvación de Nicaragua. He has promised to transition Nicaragua into a true democracy. Already many former Somoza supporters are leaving the country."

 nic.11.d:0 "Jose Figueres Ferrer, a moderate socialist, was elected president of Costa Rica in 1953. Our president Anastasio Somoza is certain that he participated in a plot to assassinate him with Caribbian Legion help (the legion had backed Figueres in his election); Somoza quickly made plans to retaliate and decided to contact Rafael Calderon Guardia, a disgruntled former president of Costa Rica, who would lead a band of rebels south from Nicaragua into Costa Rica. Lucky for us, Calderon is onboard with the plan, and promises adequate payment should we succeed."
 nic.12.d:0 "Urgent news from our Nicaraguan border: forces loyal to the disgruntled former president Rafael Calderón have crossed the border and commenced an invasion. The rebels have alreadya seized the border town of Villa Quesada. Meanwhile, our government is mobilizing its police forces, the Civil Guard, and paramilitary groups of government supporters to confront the invaders. We must ask the Organization of American States to intervene before it's too late."
 nic.13.d:0 "The Organization of American States found the Nicaraguan government was supporting the rebels and as soon as this was announced, the Nicaraguan government ended its support of the rebels. The United States sold Costa Rica four fighter planes, while the rebels were overwhelmed by the popularly backed government forces. After some fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were pushed out of Costa Rica. Jose Figueres accused the CIA of covertly aiding Nicaragua's invasion by sending pilots and sorties to covertly attack Costa Rica, notably subjecting at least 11 villages to machine gun fire."
 nic.14.d:0 "The Organization of American States has not found the funder for Calderonista Rebels. After fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were able to launch an uprising against Figures. As a result, Figures resigned and Rafael Calderón assumed the presidency."
 nic.15.d:0 "Luis Somoza Debayle formalized his grip on the presidency through fraudulent elections in February 1957 which were boycotted by all the opposition except the puppet Conservative Nationalist Party. The Social Christian Party was created in reaction to these elections and received support from younger Conservatives dissatisfied with their party’s inability to make any political impact on the dictatorship."
 nic.16.d:0 "In the midst of Luis Somoza's ascension, on Summer 1957 Luis Somoza promulgated a decree of broad and unconditional amnesty. The time covered by this amnesty decree extends from 1950 to the date of its publication in La Gaceta, the official state newspaper. It places much emphasis on the events of 1954 and does not mention the tragic events of 1956, related to the assassination of his father, but since it extends to the day this amnesty decree is promulgated, Luis Somoza was also amnestying the executors and all those possibly implicated and all prisoners and exiles, both guilty and innocent in the death of Somoza Garcia, as well as those implicated in subsequent tortures and deaths."
 nic.17.d:0 "Despite the many reforms of Luis Somoza, a seizable opposition remains. With Fidel Castros triumph in Cuba and his dedicated efforts to export his revolution and, in addition, his deed has stimulated the concerns of many to emulate that odyssey, including those here at Nicaragua.\nIn the plains of Olama, a plane coming from Punta Llorona, Costa Rica has landed with 45 armed insurgents, eager to overthrow the government of Luis Somoza. Another group has landed in Mollejones, in the Chontal valley, near Santo Tomás. The combatants belong to groups of the Nicaraguan bourgeoisie, along with Cuban rebels.\nIf that isn't enough, in El Chaparral expeditionary forces led from Cuba by Che Guevara are invading aswell. As a consequence, the students, mainly in Leon, are holding large demonstrations."
 
 
 nicr.1.d:0 "Nicaragua has just had an revolution. From what we know, an opposition to Anastasio Somoza Garcia launched a coup against him, during which he was killed. The new leader is a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone. He has assured us that this will not affect our good relations."
 nicr.2.d:0 "Today is the day for our truely free and fair elections. It is contested between the Conservative Party and the Independent Liberal Party.\nPartido Conservador is the oldest existing party in Nicaragua. It was founded during the 19th century, as Nicaragua established itself as an independent republic, by members of the elite of Granada. It aims to keep the good relatioship Nicaragua has with US.\nPartido Liberal Independiente was formed when it separated from Somoza's Nationalist Liberal Party in 1944. It maintains itself as a succesor to the old Liberal Party."
 nicr.3.d:0 "The fate of the Partido Liberal Nacionalista is currently being discussed. Whilst initially it still featured a liberal agenda (the Liberals having been one of the two main parties of Nicaragua since the 19th century along with the Conservatives), the Nationalist Liberal Party later developed into little more than a political vehicle for the kleptocracy of the Somoza clan. When Anastasio Somoza García took power in 1936, the party aligned itself with the United States and other caudillos in Latin America, like Rafael Trujillo, Oswaldo López Arellano and Fulgencio Batista.\n\nNow, a proposal has been brought forward. In it, we would allow the former members to join our party, Partido Liberal Independiente. Doing so could help us look better than the brutal Somoza regime.\nSome are however worried that their inclusion could bring Nicaragua back to the dictatorship. Of course, we could always allow some mebers to join, with restrictions like excluding them from top leadership positions."
 nicr.4.d:0 "Urgent news have arrived. It appears that President Enoc Aguado Farfán has died in a car bomb. This happened at around 9:30 this morning while the president was travelling to a press conference in Leon. The president and two others who were in the car have been killed.\nThe motive for this attack is unknown according to the police. However, some are suscpeting that former members of the Somoza administration are to blame. Following a quick leadership election, the new president is René Schick Gutiérrez, a former member of the Nationalist Liberal Party, now the United Liberal Party."

Things like small properties, cars, jewlery and other similar things. Now [NIC.GetLeader] must decide who will have them. One option is to randomly give them to the workers and peasants in a lottery. That way they could be given away fairly and equally. On the other hand, they could be given to the top leadership of the party for their hard work and dedication to the revolution. The people however might not see it that way and would most likely accuse us of elitism."

With this act I confirm my administration and intend to make an evaluation in the upcoming weeks, to see which measures will be needed to be taken in order to secure our nation," said Calero.\n\n23 soldiers have been killed during the protests, and according to unofficial sources, 1588 people have been killed since the putsch."

Our operatives are infiltrating the churches, along with the surveillance of the clergy and the churches themselves. To be clear, we’re not just watching the church; we’re also watching those with connections to the church. We are looking for any suspicious activities that could be signs of upcoming anti-government demonstrations or acts of terrorism. We will publish more details as the operation progresses. But let me say that we will be unrelenting in our pursuit of those who seek to provoke our compatriots and disrupt the public order.\n\nLong live the revolution!"
 nicc.8.d:0 "Tomas Borge was sitting in his desk when the phone rang. On the other end was Sergio Fontanez, local Sdl captain in Masaya Department. He sounded pleased.\n\n“Comrade, operation Watchful Eye has showed results. Just few hours ago our officers followed up on a tip and conducted a suprise raid at the La Asunción church in Masaya. Several suspects were arrested, including José R. Somoza, a former Somoza general and a member of Unión Nacional Nicaragüense,” Fontanez said.\n\n“In addition, officers recovered several guns, forged documents, and  stolen government documents” Fontanez added.\n\n"This proves us right. That the churches are working with the rebels. How many more similar cells are our there. Their activities are illegal and must be stopped," Borge replied.\n\n"Indeed Comrade. However we have to be careful with our next steps, lest we want them to be tipped off. I'll compile an official report on the raid and send it to Sdl HQ. That is all."\n\nAnd with that Fontanez said goodbye and hung up the phone. Borge poured himself a drink and sat down in his chair with a slight smile."

The targets of these arrests appear to be mostly members of FSSN, the banned former ruling party of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, FSSN has escalated its calls for a general strike and an open rebellion against the government. Recently FSSN led a series of roadblocks around the Moskito Coast, and openly rioted in the streets of Managua, San Juan de Nicaragua and Masaya.\nA total of 742 people were arrested for alleged violence, terrorism and other charges. 34 Officers were injured during the arrests, and 148 rebels were killed."
 nicc.10.d:0 "As the morning sun begins to shine, there's excitement in the air. For the first time in decades, we are holding free democratic elections. To prevent harrasment from all sides, the polling stations are guarded both by Policía Nacional and international UN observers. The first stations open at 8:00am, and the lines are stretching for miles. Election workers begin distributing ballots and the elections are at full swing. For the presidental position there are four different parties that are expected to have chances to win.\n\nFormed from by supporters and members of the communist regime, Coalición Liberal Laborista (GLL) proclaims to be a democratic socialist party; nevertheless it's obvious the Sandinista ideology still dominates the party.\nWith the recent arrest and harrasment of former FSSN members, the potential candidate list was small. In the end they nominated Arturo Conejero.\n\nA Successor to the liberal parties of the past, Movimiento Liberal Constitucionalista (MLC) is seen as a centre-right liberal-conservative party. Their candidate is Ramiro Sacasa Guerro, a relative of the Somozas who joined the revolution to remove them.\n\nPartido Conservador Unido (PCU) is the age old rival of the liberals of Nicaragua. It consists of the city elite, some former party elites and christian democrats. Their candidate is Fernando Agüero Rocha, a member of Congreso Nacional.\n\nAnd then there's the least likely winner, Movimiento de Acción Nacional de Nicaragua, commonly know as El Movimiento. It consists of former Somoza government members, former generals and other nationalist and right-wing groups. Rumours say that behind the scenes the party is controlled by the CIA. As such, this party would most likely please the americans.\nSince the party is diverse, it had difficulties choosing a leader. While the race thought to have been between the current leader Adolfo Calero and Arturo Cruz Sr., in the end it went to Enrique Bermúdez, known as Comandante 380 and Lieutenant colonel of the army.\n\nAs the ballots close, the vote counting starts immediately.

 nicc.11.d:0 "FROM: REDACTED\n\nComrade Borge. As per your instructions, Carlos Fonseca has been stripped of his position as the vice chairman of the party. He will remain an ordinary member, but he will no longer participate in any party meetings or policy-making. He will not act in any political office of the party. This is punishment for his role in the plot after the Central Committee voted against deposing you. I assure you, this will have no effects for us."
 nicc.12.d:0 "FROM: Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nEsteemed Chairman,\nWe bring before you a proposal that can potentially transform Nicaragua's economy and boost our international relations with COMECON countries, particularly with East Germany. The Department of Foreign Affairs has developed a tourism program that aims to attract tourists from these countries. This initiative includes the construction of new hotels along the western coast and the development of Bluefields into a tourist hotspot.\n\nIf implemented, this plan will bring direct investment and high-spending tourism from outside Nicaragua, which will contribute to expanding our economy. However, as with any significant project, there are challenges that we must overcome. Firstly, we need a considerable amount of funds for building and making the city secure. Secondly, there are concerns from the Miskito community about the effects of the proposed plan on their culture and way of life. While we acknowledge their concerns, we believe that this project will bring significant benefits to the country as a whole.\n\nTherefore, I ask you to consider this proposal carefully and weigh its potential benefits against its possible drawbacks. Should we move forward with the plan, or should we reconsider? The decision rests with you, Mr. Chairman."
 nicc.13.d:0 "As a result of the extraordinary party meeting, Tomas Borge had no choice but to announce his retirement as the party leader effective immediately. As a result, the party elected Carlos Fonseca to replace him."
 nicc.14.d:0 "Che Guevara has left Nicaragua to assist in other revolutions. Because of this, we need a new chairman. While many expected Carlos Fonseca or Tomás Borge to fill that post, it eventually went to Silvio Mayorga Moreno, a close ally and friend of Guevara. In his first speech, he pledged to continue the path that Che Gueveara had set for Nicaragua."
 nicc.15.d:0 "It is time for the politburo to elect a new vice chairman to the party. The former Chairman Silvio Mayorga was promoted to leadership position after the departure of Che and as such, a new vice chairman is needed.\nThe party's elite members, including regional representatives and high-ranking officials, have gathered in the capital city of Managua to participate in the elections. The atmosphere is tense and electric, as the contenders for the position of Vice Chairman eagerly campaign for their supporters votes.\n\nThe first candidate, Juan Alberto Henríquez Oporta, is a rising star in the party, known for his vocal support of maoist policies. He argues that the party needs a fresh perspective, and that he is the candidate who could bring that new energy and passion to the Vice Chairman's role. He is popular with the pro-Chinese members of the party. \n\nThe second candidate, Álvaro Ramírez González, is a former guerrilla leader who fought against Somoza, before turning to a career in public administration. Despite his hisotry, he is seen as a neutral bureaucrat who has no particular allegiance to any faction within the party. He presents himself as a compromise candidate that most of Poliburo can support.\n\nThe final candidate, Eli Altamirano Pérez, is a trade union leader with a long history of activism, having been jailed three times during the wave of repression that followed the assassination of Anastasio Somoza in 1956. He positions himself as a champion of the working class, highlighting his experience as a trade unionist and his long history of fighting for workers' rights. However, his radical policies make him a divisive figure within the party. He draws his support from the younger members of the Politburo.\n\nWith the voting done, the members anxiously await the results. The voting committee requires five days to count the votes."
 nicc.16.d:0 "Tensions are escalating within the party as its leadership takes a more hardline stance on issues such as foreign policy and revolutionary strategy. One of the party's founders and respected intellectual, Carlos Fonseca Amador, has become a vocal critic. Fonseca Amador had long advocated for a more moderate, pragmatic approach to socialism and disagrees with the party's growing radicalism. He believes the party is straying too far from its roots and should instead focus on traditional communism.\nDespite his stature within the party, Fonseca Amador's dissenting voice is seen as a threat by the party leadership. They fear that his criticisms could undermine party unity and lead to a split within the party. In the summer of [GetYear], the party leadership launched a series of purges to root out dissent within the party. Fonseca Amador was targeted and accused of disloyalty and working against the party's interests. Despite his protests and attempts to defend himself, Fonseca Amador was ultimately expelled from the party. The decision was a bitter blow for him, and he felt betrayed by his former comrades.\n\nIn the weeks following his expulsion, Fonseca Amador continued to speak out against the party's policies. However, his outspokenness was short-lived. A few weeks after his expulsion, in the early hours of a rainy morning, he was assassinated outside his home by an unknown assailant. The details of his death were unclear, but it was widely believed that he had been targeted by the party leadership or by its allies in the Servicio de Inteligencia."

Our beloved leader and general secretary, Silvio Mayorga, has been assassinated in cold blood. As you may already know, he was holding a high-level meeting with his top advisors when an armed gunman entered the room and fired five shots at him. Though security personnel managed to neutralize the attacker, it was too late to save our leader, who succumbed to his injuries within minutes. From what we know, the assailant was a former general who had worked with the Somoza family.\n\nSilvio Mayorga was not just a leader to us, but also a mentor, a visionary, and a true champion of the people. His untimely death has not only created a void in our hearts but also a leadership vacuum in the country. This is where you come in, Vice Chairman. You are hereby promoted to the general secretary of our great nation.\n\nYour first task is to report to the politburo, the seat of power, as soon as possible. There, you will be briefed by the ministers and other high-ranking officials on the current state of affairs and the measures needed to be taken in the aftermath of Silvio Mayorga's death. You will also be expected to address the nation and assure them that the government is in safe hands. May you be guided by the principles of our great leader, Silvio Mayorga, and lead the country towards peace, prosperity, and progress."
 nicc.18.d:0 "In a surprising move, the government of Nicaragua has announced that it is purging the Guevarist wing of the ruling party and adopting anti-Guevarist ideology. The decision, which comes after the nomination of Juan Alberto, is seen as a significant departure from the country's long-held socialist beliefs.\nThe government claims that the purge is necessary to rid the country of counter-revolutionary elements and ensure the continued success of the socialist experiment. The move has sparked concern among many Nicaraguans who have long supported the Guevarist movement.\n\nCritics of the government have accused it of betraying the ideals of the revolution and warned that the adoption of anti-Guevarist ideology will result in a more repressive government. However, the government remains steadfast in its commitment to the new ideology and has promised to be vigilant against any attempts to undermine the revolution.\nIt is still unclear what this means for the future of Nicaragua and the wider region, but it is clear that the country has entered a new era, one where Guevarism is no longer the dominant ideology."
 nicc.19.d:0 "Our government has recently announced the introduction of voluntary Albanian language and cultural classes to the national curriculum, a move that pays tribute to the legacy of Enver Hoxha and his socialist achievements in Albania. The classes are set to begin in the next academic year and will be open to all students who are interested in learning more about Albanian culture and history.\n\nWe should see it as a way to strengthen ties between Nicaragua and Albania, and to inspire students to pursue new avenues of learning. As a nation committed to socialist ideals, we believe that these classes will provide a unique opportunity for students to gain a deeper understanding of the broader world and to develop a greater appreciation for socialist principles.\nFurthermore, the introduction of Albanian language and cultural classes will not only broaden the horizons of students but also provide them with a valuable skillset that will benefit them in their future careers. The ability to speak multiple languages and understand different cultures is increasingly important in our globalized world, and we are proud to offer our students this opportunity.\nIn closing, we encourage all students to take advantage of this exciting new opportunity and to embrace the rich culture and history of Albania."
 nicc.20.d: "The Central Committee of the Nicaraguan Communist Party has convened for an emergency session. The meeting was initiated by Carlos Fonseca, the founder and ideologue of the party, and his loyalists. They have launched a fierce attack on Tomás Borge, the current General Secretary, accusing him of betraying the revolution, imposing a dictatorship, and serving Moscow’s interests. Fonseca claims that Borge has lost touch with the masses, and that he must step down for the sake of the party and the country. Borge, however, is not willing to give up his power without a fight. He has his own supporters within the party, as well as the backing of the Soviet Union and Cuba. He denounces Fonseca as a traitor, a revisionist, and a CIA agent. The meeting quickly turns into a heated debate, with both sides hurling insults and threats at each other. The fate of the party and the revolution hangs in the balance."
