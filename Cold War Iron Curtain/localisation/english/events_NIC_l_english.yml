 nic.5.d:0 "Coffee is on the most numerous exports of Nicaragua. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 19th century. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production requires significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws have therefore been passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. Profits from coffee production flows abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee are virtually nonexistent."
 nic.6.d:0 "Some civilians, several exiled Nicaraguan military personnel, and other active military personnel, who disagree with President Somoza Garcia have planned a coup d'état. Rumours say that even Emiliano Chamorro has something to do with this.\n\n On [GetDate] an ambush was set off on the Southern Managua highway with the intention of capturing President Somoza Garcia, on his way to Montelimar hacienda. It was planned and mounted by dissident officers of the National Guard together with a group of young conservatives and one or two liberals, who rejected Somoza's rule. When the capital hears about the coup, they hear that..."
 nic.7.d:0 "President Somoza has just informed me that two members National Guard were killed, one wounded today in attempt to assassinate him. Three truckloads arms and ammunition smuggled from Costa Rica with full knowledge Costa Rican officials especially Colonel Herrera of Civil Guard, the President claimed. Attempt made to ambush him last night on leaving reception my house but he told us then that he had been tipped off and guards ran men away from nearby city water tank. Today, two guardsmen attempted to stop suspicious truck on road to Montelimar but occupants opened fire. A motorcycle policeman joined the fray and he and one guardsman killed and the other guard wounded. Child passing by also killed. Assailants escaped but are believed to be surrounded. Somoza told Colonel Layton there were fourteen men in truck. Colonel Rogers says air force spotted abandoned truck containing ammunition and he learned some men in jeep were arrested in front my residence gate last night.\n\nPresident told Layton he was declaring martial law. President claims General Chamorro back of plot. Chamorro failed to appear in my reception last night which was unusual, Somoza then commenting on it."
 nic.8.d:0 "The plan was defeated and those involved were captured and Subsequently, most of these prisoners were taken to some coffee plantations in the Department of Carazo and cruelly executed, some few were left alive, taken to the military prisons of the Loma de Tiscapa, later tried in Council of War, those summarily executed were partially burned and buried in a common grave.\n\nA small group of rebels who had managed to escape from the trap set by the National Guard and who were heading towards the Costa Rican border on board a truck, were captured at Cuatro Esquinas and all were executed by troops commanded by Captain Agustín Peralta Ruiz.\n\nFaced with so much repression, many went into self-exile directly or took refuge in some embassy; the pacts were broken and General Emiliano Chamorro ordered the withdrawal of the conservative deputies and senators from the National Congress, but not all of them paid attention to him."
 nic.9.d:0 "The age of Anastasio Somoza Garcia has come to an sudden end when he was killed during a coup d'état, done by disgrunteled military and civilan personnel. In his place rises a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone, leading the Frente de Salvación de Nicaragua. He has promised to transition Nicaragua into a true democracy. Already many former Somoza supporters are leaving the country."

 nic.11.d:0 "Jose Figueres Ferrer, a moderate socialist, was elected president of Costa Rica in 1953. Our president Anastasio Somoza is certain that he participated in a plot to assassinate him with Caribbian Legion help (the legion had backed Figueres in his election); Somoza quickly made plans to retaliate and decided to contact Rafael Calderon Guardia, a disgruntled former president of Costa Rica, who would lead a band of rebels south from Nicaragua into Costa Rica. Lucky for us, Calderon is onboard with the plan, and promises adequate payment should we succeed."
 nic.12.d:0 "Urgent news from our Nicaraguan border: forces loyal to the disgruntled former president Rafael Calderón have crossed the border and commenced an invasion. The rebels have alreadya seized the border town of Villa Quesada. Meanwhile, our government is mobilizing its police forces, the Civil Guard, and paramilitary groups of government supporters to confront the invaders. We must ask the Organization of American States to intervene before it's too late."
 nic.13.d:0 "The Organization of American States found the Nicaraguan government was supporting the rebels and as soon as this was announced, the Nicaraguan government ended its support of the rebels. The United States sold Costa Rica four fighter planes, while the rebels were overwhelmed by the popularly backed government forces. After some fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were pushed out of Costa Rica. Jose Figueres accused the CIA of covertly aiding Nicaragua's invasion by sending pilots and sorties to covertly attack Costa Rica, notably subjecting at least 11 villages to machine gun fire."
 nic.14.d:0 "The Organization of American States has not found the funder for Calderonista Rebels. After fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were able to launch an uprising against Figures. As a result, Figures resigned and Rafael Calderón assumed the presidency."
 nic.15.d:0 "Luis Somoza Debayle formalized his grip on the presidency through fraudulent elections in February 1957 which were boycotted by all the opposition except the puppet Conservative Nationalist Party. The Social Christian Party was created in reaction to these elections and received support from younger Conservatives dissatisfied with their party’s inability to make any political impact on the dictatorship."
 nic.16.d:0 "In the midst of Luis Somoza's ascension, on Summer 1957 Luis Somoza promulgated a decree of broad and unconditional amnesty. The time covered by this amnesty decree extends from 1950 to the date of its publication in La Gaceta, the official state newspaper. It places much emphasis on the events of 1954 and does not mention the tragic events of 1956, related to the assassination of his father, but since it extends to the day this amnesty decree is promulgated, Luis Somoza was also amnestying the executors and all those possibly implicated and all prisoners and exiles, both guilty and innocent in the death of Somoza Garcia, as well as those implicated in subsequent tortures and deaths."
 nic.17.d:0 "Despite the many reforms of Luis Somoza, a seizable opposition remains. With Fidel Castros triumph in Cuba and his dedicated efforts to export his revolution and, in addition, his deed has stimulated the concerns of many to emulate that odyssey, including those here at Nicaragua.\nIn the plains of Olama, a plane coming from Punta Llorona, Costa Rica has landed with 45 armed insurgents, eager to overthrow the government of Luis Somoza. Another group has landed in Mollejones, in the Chontal valley, near Santo Tomás. The combatants belong to groups of the Nicaraguan bourgeoisie, along with Cuban rebels.\nIf that isn't enough, in El Chaparral expeditionary forces led from Cuba by Che Guevara are invading aswell. As a consequence, the students, mainly in Leon, are holding large demonstrations."
 
 
 nicr.1.d:0 "Nicaragua has just had an revolution. From what we know, an opposition to Anastasio Somoza Garcia launched a coup against him, during which he was killed. The new leader is a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone. He has assured us that this will not affect our good relations."
 nicr.2.d:0 "Today is the day for our truely free and fair elections. It is contested between the Conservative Party and the Independent Liberal Party.\nPartido Conservador is the oldest existing party in Nicaragua. It was founded during the 19th century, as Nicaragua established itself as an independent republic, by members of the elite of Granada. It aims to keep the good relatioship Nicaragua has with US.\nPartido Liberal Independiente was formed when it separated from Somoza's Nationalist Liberal Party in 1944. It maintains itself as a succesor to the old Liberal Party."
 nicr.3.d:0 "The fate of the Partido Liberal Nacionalista is currently being discussed. Whilst initially it still featured a liberal agenda (the Liberals having been one of the two main parties of Nicaragua since the 19th century along with the Conservatives), the Nationalist Liberal Party later developed into little more than a political vehicle for the kleptocracy of the Somoza clan. When Anastasio Somoza García took power in 1936, the party aligned itself with the United States and other caudillos in Latin America, like Rafael Trujillo, Oswaldo López Arellano and Fulgencio Batista.\n\nNow, a proposal has been brought forward. In it, we would allow the former members to join our party, Partido Liberal Independiente. Doing so could help us look better than the brutal Somoza regime.\nSome are however worried that their inclusion could bring Nicaragua back to the dictatorship. Of course, we could always allow some mebers to join, with restrictions like excluding them from top leadership positions."
 nicr.4.d:0 "Urgent news have arrived. It appears that President Enoc Aguado Farfán has died in a car bomb. This happened at around 9:30 this morning while the president was travelling to a press conference in Leon. The president and two others who were in the car have been killed.\nThe motive for this attack is unknown according to the police. However, some are suscpeting that former members of the Somoza administration are to blame. Following a quick leadership election, the new president is René Schick Gutiérrez, a former member of the Nationalist Liberal Party, now the United Liberal Party."

The trial shall be quick and conducted by the Revolutionary Justice Court. Headed by [NIC.GetLeader], the court deliberated for 3 days, during which two sides formed. The first side wants to imprison him. During his imprisonment, he shall be re-educated into a good worker, just like Emperor Puyi. The second side on the other hand wants to hang him for the crimes he and his family has commited during their rule.\n\nLuis Somoza Debayle, this court finds you guilty of treason and crimes against humanity. As such, this court sentences you to..."

Things like small properties, cars, jewlery and other similar things. Now [NIC.GetLeader] must decide who will have them. One option is to randomly give them to the workers and peasants in a lottery. That way they could be given away fairly and equally. On the other hand, they could be given to the top leadership of the party for their hard work and dedication to the revolution. The people however might not see it that way and would most likely accuse us of elitism."

 nicc.5.d:0 "General Adolfo Calero Portocarrero has declared martial law In Nicaragua in response to violence after the former Somoza general declared a coup few days ago.\nIn a televised speech from the presidential palace in Managua, Calero said he is invoking the emergency decree to regulate and monitor security in the country, after violence broke out in various parts of the country following the coup.\n\n\"I hereby declare the emergency rule, with the purposes of monitoring and controlling the internal security of the national state. With this act I confirm my administration and intend to make an evaluation in the upcoming weeks, to see which measures will be needed to be taken in order to secure our nation," said Calero.\n\n23 soldiers have been killed during the protests, and according to unofficial sources, 1588 people have been killed since the putsch."

 nicc.7.d:0 "FROM: Director de Servicio de Inteligencia\nSUBJECT: Operation Watchful Eye\n\nChairman, attached is the report on Operation Watchful Eye. Our operatives are infiltrating the churches, along with the surveillance of the clergy and the churches themselves. To be clear, we’re not just watching the church; we’re also watching those with connections to the church. We are looking for any suspicious activities that could be signs of upcoming anti-government demonstrations or acts of terrorism. We will publish more details as the operation progresses. But let me say that we will be unrelenting in our pursuit of those who seek to provoke our compatriots and disrupt the public order.\n\nLong live the revolution!"
 nicc.8.d:0 "Tomas Borge was sitting in his desk when the phone rang. On the other end was Sergio Fontanez, local Sdl captain in Masaya Department. He sounded pleased.\n\n“Comrade, operation Watchful Eye has showed results. Just few hours ago our officers followed up on a tip and conducted a suprise raid at the La Asunción church in Masaya. Several suspects were arrested, including José R. Somoza, a former Somoza general and a member of Unión Nacional Nicaragüense,” Fontanez said.\n\n“In addition, officers recovered several guns, forged documents, and  stolen government documents” Fontanez added.\n\n"This proves us right. That the churches are working with the rebels. How many more similar cells are our there. Their activities are illegal and must be stopped," Borge replied.\n\n"Indeed Comrade. However we have to be careful with our next steps, lest we want them to be tipped off. I'll compile an official report on the raid and send it to Sdl HQ. That is all."\n\nAnd with that Fontanez said goodbye and hung up the phone. Borge poured himself a drink and sat down in his chair with a slight smile."
 nicc.9.d:0 "Yesterday La Policía Nacional conducted mass arrests all over Nicaragua. The targets of these arrests appear to be mostly members of FSSN, the banned former ruling party of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, FSSN has escalated its calls for a general strike and an open rebellion against the government. Recently FSSN led a series of roadblocks around the Moskito Coast, and openly rioted in the streets of Managua, San Juan de Nicaragua and Masaya.\nA total of 742 people were arrested for alleged violence, terrorism and other charges. 34 Officers were injured during the arrests, and 148 rebels were killed."
 nicc.10.d:0 "As the morning sun begins to shine, there's excitement in the air. For the first time in decades, we are holding free democratic elections. To prevent harrasment from all sides, the polling stations are guarded both by Policía Nacional and international UN observers. The first stations open at 8:00am, and the lines are stretching for miles. Election workers begin distributing ballots and the elections are at full swing. For the presidental position there are four different parties that are expected to have chances to win.\n\nFormed from by supporters and members of the communist regime, Coalición Liberal Laborista (GLL) proclaims to be a democratic socialist party; nevertheless it's obvious the Sandinista ideology still dominates the party.\nWith the recent arrest and harrasment of former FSSN members, the potential candidate list was small. In the end they nominated Arturo Conejero.\n\nA Successor to the liberal parties of the past, Movimiento Liberal Constitucionalista (MLC) is seen as a centre-right liberal-conservative party. Their candidate is Ramiro Sacasa Guerro, a relative of the Somozas who joined the revolution to remove them.\n\nPartido Conservador Unido (PCU) is the age old rival of the liberals of Nicaragua. It consists of the city elite, some former party elites and christian democrats. Their candidate is Fernando Agüero Rocha, a member of Congreso Nacional.\n\nAnd then there's the least likely winner, Movimiento de Acción Nacional de Nicaragua, commonly know as El Movimiento. It consists of former Somoza government members, former generals and other nationalist and right-wing groups. Rumours say that behind the scenes the party is controlled by the CIA. As such, this party would most likely please the americans.\nSince the party is diverse, it had difficulties choosing a leader. While the race thought to have been between the current leader Adolfo Calero and Arturo Cruz Sr., in the end it went to Enrique Bermúdez, known as Comandante 380 and Lieutenant colonel of the army.\n\nAs the ballots close, the vote counting starts immediately. As the ballots are counted, the results are being broadcasted for radio and television.\n\"Dear Nicaraguans.

He will remain an ordinary member, but he will no longer participate in any party meetings or policy-making. He will not act in any political office of the party. This is punishment for his role in the plot after the Central Committee voted against deposing you. I assure you, this will have no effects for us."
 nicc.12.d:0 "FROM: Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nMr. Chairman, let's get straight into it. The Department of Foreign Affairs has developed an additional tourism program,aimed at bringing tourists from COMECON countries, particilary from East Germany. The plan would include funding of new hotels around the western coast, along with transforming Bluefields into a tourist hotspot.\nThis would mean, for the first time in some time, direct investment and high-spending tourism from outside Nicaragua, and help expand our economy even further.\n\Everything a price however. We need some serious funds for building a making the city secure. As for the Miskito, we think they would not like it. You are free to of course just ignore their concerns.\nSo what do you think? Should we enact the plan? Or are you against it?"
