 INF_COUP_DESC:0 "Costs 750 PP, requires 50%> level of influence and 75 Po In an extreme and costly act, an entire country's government system can be supplanted. This requires serious planning and infiltration and as such, will tie down a massive portion of a country's international clout and resources in order to gather intel on a mass scale, move weapons, plan attacks internally, and do it all outside of the awareness of the target nation's politicians and their internal/external intelligence assets. If this act fails, the country itself is unlikely to ever deal with the perpetrator again and they may not be trusted by the international community."
 INF_DEFENSE_DESC:0 "Costs 10 Power Projection Points and have at least 50% level of influence over the target. Defensive pacts are guarantees for each nation to come to each-other's defense in times of war. By leveraging favorable influences in a country, a defensive pact may come to fruition.

 INF_ECON_DESC:0 "Costs 100 PP and 3 Power Projection Points. Negotiating favorable foreign investments is a difficult art. You may desire the best deal that your country can get but foreign investors desire more profits in their pockets. Through the art of the deal, favorable conditions can be negotiated from foreign investors and banks. Creative projections, investment security promises, and some shady backroom deals can enable a country to negotiate abnormally favorable deals at the expense of the investor."
 INF_POLI_DESC:0 "Costs 200 Political Power and 25 Power Projection Points. Being aligned with a nation opens up avenues for communication and diplomacy, but can also spread ideals. By leveraging international clout, political pressures can be applied to a country in order to change its ideology. Even in the most stalwart of nations, friends and influencers can have significant leverage."
 FPP_TOOLTIP:0 "Power projection is the measurement of your international clout that enables you to perform special diplomatic or political actions. The ability to project power in international relations is measured in your ability to respond to crises, rapidly deploy and sustain forces, and press international relations and forces in your favor. Power projection is scarce and strictly limited by available diplomatic and military task forces. Overextension of these assets is physically impossible."
