 VIE_MINIGAME_INTERNAL_POLITICS_TT:0 "Internal Politics\n\n As the power struggles continue, the act of keeping the Vietnamese people in the minds of leadership while also pleasing our French backers has become a constant burning mess. Pleasing one side over the other completely will likely result in either a wave of outrage from the people or a crisis in confidence in our regime from the French."
 VIE_MINIGAME_POWER_STRUGGLE_TT:0 "The Power Struggle\n\n As rival claimants to the government clash on the political battlefield, major players in the campaign have made normal life in Vietnam appear closer to a thriller, as common people watch a game of politics play out in front of them. On the other side of the struggle, the French interests in Vietnam watch with horrible fascination at who will win the struggle, silently hoping that the winner will be more favorable to their goals and interests."
 VIE_MINIGAME_FAVORITISM_TT:0 "Favoritism\n\n Favoritism is marked by the percentages and the ticking box below. A higher percentage means that the leader in question is more likely to be swayed by the French who will reward us handsomely, but whose government may not be popular with the public. A lower percentage means that the people see that given leader's government as more favorable, but they are less likely to work with the French."


 ALT_MINIGAME_TT:0 "[GetMinigameAltTT]"

 BAO_DAI_MINIGAME_TT:0 "Bao Dai\n\n Despite doing what he could to capitalize on his legitimacy, Emperor Bao Dai's government has been unpopular as ever. As it was when he was a puppet of the French, he chose the wrong advisors, took misguided advice, and burned the national budget to critical levels. Now, other candidates for legitimacy have begged for a chance to prove to the people and the French government that they hold the national interests in mind, and can do the job effectively and pragmatically."
 CUONG_MINIGAME_TT:0 "Cuong-De\n\n As the intrigue of the political battles increased, Cuong-De, who perhaps set the chain of events in motion, chaffed at the looming hand of French interests in Vietnamese policy, while Bao Dai's government continued to spiral into incompetence and decadence. Determined to make a stand for his country, he has committed himself to ensure that the people are heard, and that he can take over government to revenge a personal feud and to  represents the people’s interests above all others."
 XUAN_MINIGAME_TT:0 ""
 NGUYEN_MINIGAME_TT:0 "Nguyen-Phan-Long\n\n A bit player in the political battles that have plagued the country, Long emerged as a bridge between us and the Cao-dai and a softer hand than the deeply unpopular Bao Dai. Keen observers understand that beyond this posturing and strong showing, he has been positioning himself as France's more favorable option, in order to undermine the Emperor's legitimacy abroad."
 HUU_MINIGAME_TT:0 "Tran-Van-Huu\n\n One of the larger faces of the government policies that have been championed by French interests, Huu has emerged behind these policies as a moderate, who has not completely committed to one side or the other in this ongoing conflict. It appears that he is motivated by something other than the desire to lead a just and representative government, with no questions asked."
