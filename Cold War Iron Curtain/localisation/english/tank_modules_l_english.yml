 gwtank_chassis:0 "Inter-War Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc:0 "The tank has proven itself a powerful weapon in the Great War. While development has slowed in the intervening years, it is no doubt going to play a major role in the wars to come."
 armor_tech_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Improved Armor Protection"

 armor_tech_4:0 "Modern Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 engine_tech_1:0 "Basic Engine"

 engine_tech_4:0 "Modern Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."

 tank_rocket_launcher:0 "Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc:0 "A multi-barrelled launcher for unguided, high-explosive rockets. The high volume of fire gives it excellent performance against soft targets, but even direct hits do little against armored targets."
 tank_rocket_launcher_2:0 "Improved Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_2_desc:0 "While there are a number of improvements to accuracy, the main advantage of this improved rocket launcher is that it can hold more rockets to fire at the enemy."

 squeezebore_adaptor:0 "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc:0 "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."
