 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Iron Curtain"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The post-war optimism of global cooperation and peace epitomized by the establishment of the United Nations has quickly evaporated. During the last war European empires exhausted not only their own blood and treasure but also that of their colonial territories. Now, colonized peoples across Africa and Asia are demanding independence. Globally, the United States and the Soviet Union now greatly surpass any other power. The beginnings of an ideological rivalry between the two states sees their wartime friendship quickly cool. Already lines are being drawn across Europe as an ideological partition increasingly separates the capitalist and communist regimes."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The era of British Imperialism has come to an end. The allure of independence is far too great for those subjugated under the British crown. Her colonies around the world are seeing increases in popularity for Nationalist and Communist movements alike. As the United Kingdom's global power wanes, it looks to its Western allies to safeguard against the threat of Communism, now closer than ever. Long gone are the fears of Oswald Mosley, now the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finally free of both US and Japanese occupation, the newly established Republic of Korea was hopeful for peaceful reunification with their separated countrymen above the 38th parallel. But after the suspicious assassination of the only senior politician willing to negotiate with the North and the staunch anti-Communist Lee Seung Man winning the presidency, that hope was waning fast. The US may have handed over the keys but neither Korea is in control, and with both republics claiming the peninsula conflict is inevitable."
 WGR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The once great German nation has been defeated once more. With the glory of the German empire just a distant memory, and the euphoria of their conquests just years earlier marred by shame and frustration, the German people once again find themselves at the barrel of a gun. Occupied by both superpowers of the world, they are the chess board for their political games. Tired are the people of Germany, with a great deal of rebuilding to do. All that's left is hope for de escalation and reunification with their Eastern brethren."
 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under Soviet Military governorship, the people of East Germany find themselves under the rule of the very people they oppressed. Morale is low, but things are looking up as plans are in place to create a German Democratic Republic. With Soviet leaderships, construction is making good progress, but life is difficult as the society has become strictly regimented and the full blame of the war is laid upon their shoulders. Already, large portions of the population have adopted the Communist ideology wholeheartedly, creating an ideological divide between the two Germany's that may last for generations…"
 KPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shortly following the declaration of the Republic of Korea, revolutionary Kim Il Sung along with the Soviet Civil Administration have drafted the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Now independent of Soviet control and with borders with two powerful Communist nations Kim is poised to liberate his comrades below the 38th parallel. With Soviet equipment, Chinese manpower and a unified population under the Juche system, the War for Korean Reunification should be a cakewalk. After all, their guardian, the United States, is busy with bigger problems…"
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People's Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the People's Republic is prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Zedong following the Great March has allowed Chinese Communism to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thanks to the sacrifice of millions of brave Communists, Fascism has for the most part been wiped off of the Earth. But behind the fallen monster hides an even greater threat. The threat of Capitalism. Only having just liberated themselves, the Soviet Union must stand up to protect the world from yet another imperialistic system. The people of the world require a strong guiding hand, and there is no better candidate than the Soviet Union. Communism is gaining momentum, and Joseph Stalin intends to keep it that way."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the United States victory in the Second World War, it has positioned itself as the champion of Western Democracy. Strongly upholding its Capitalist values, it vehemently opposes the Communist East, led by the Soviet Union. Instead of demilitarizing after the destruction caused by WW2, the nation's military continues to grow to face the red menace. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States and the West truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Zionism has finally achieved its goals and a Jewish State has been established, not all is well though as Israel emerges out of its war of independence with all its neighbors as a nation at the crossroads. With Jews coming all over the world, Israel's political order will be reshaped considerably for years to come. Israel, while resilient, must always be prepared for the next disaster, the next war, and they won't let the 2000 year exile start all over again."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948, Tito's model of Market Socialism was working well with funding from the United State' Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia, while being greatly damaged by Italian and German occupation found themselves with a better quality of living than any other Communist state. However, their political stability was something else entirely. Tito was beloved by his countrymen, but his strategy of neutrality was despised by both East and West. With constant threats from both sides, can Yugoslavia maintain itself as an independent Socialist country?"
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under the firm hand of Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Mongolia is on its way to modernization. Maintaining a strong relationship with the Soviet Union, Mongolia is nevertheless trying to keep its independence. While not as bad as in the 30s, arrests and executions are still done similar to Stalin."
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Iraq stands in a position to do much in the Middle East despite its loss in that war, yet it faces a problem with Kurd rebels, most recently inspired by Mustafa Barzani's revolt. Iraq depends upon the British which have access to their oil through the Iraqi Petroleum Company in exchange for aid. At this Hashemite court, there is great conflict between the new "free" military officers and the old monarchist court that must be resolved."
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt is said to have achieved independence in 1922 however a large portion of the population do not believe this to be true in anything more than name. King Farouk is seen by many Egyptians as a key instrument to British control over the Suez Canal. There is opposition to the reigning monarch in all circles; government, civilian and military. It is the will of Egyptian and Pan-Arab nationalists to liberate the Suez from British hands. The continued rule of King Farouk looks unlikely without extraordinary British support."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Syrian Republic's road to independence was a path marred with troubles, and after independence sees more troubles. Along with the failure to thwart the formation of Israel, the government of Shukri al-Quwatli was overthrown in a US-backed military coup. Although General Husni al-Zaim sits in the throne comfortably, other Generals look for their turn to usurp leadership. When Syria can break the chains of dictatorships, can it achieve greatness?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japans imperial ambitions were crushed by the allies. Now under American occupation, this former imperial power is now trying to recover from the devastating firebombing campaign it faced during World war 2. How will Japanese future look? Will they be embrace the new democratic path or do something more radical?"
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thailand emerged from World War II territorially unscathed. Despite supporting Japan, the United States supported a new democratic regime and the country only had to give up its territorial gains from the early part of the war. Despite holding elections and leading efforts to reverse the previous regime's autocracy, the suspicious death of King Mahidol plunged the country into political turmoil. The military seized power in 1947 and returned the wartime Prime Minister, Phibun, back to power. Prime Minister Phibun now oversees a post-war economic boom, a harsh crackdown on the opposition, and deeper relations with the United States. Thailand offers itself as a bastion of anti-communism in Southeast Asia. However, the military repression has led to communist and ethnic radicalism which may threaten Thailand's ruling regime in the future."
 CUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "President Ramon Grau directed radicals to implement a series of reforms and abrogated the hated Platt Amendment in 1934. However, this government collapsed after a military coup led by the US-backed conservative right. Fulgencio Batista emerged the power behind the presidency from 1934-1940. In 1940 he became President but in 1944 Ramon Grau returned to power. President Grau oversaw more reforms but the wartime economic boom led to rampant corruption and extreme political as well as criminal violence. Newly elected President Carlos Soccaras promises a return to democratic civility and reform, but corruption continues unabated. The government's failure to act has led the left, under the leadership of radical student leaders and the right, led by Batista to grow increasingly disillusioned with democracy. Through all of this, the United States is following the situation and its assets in Cuba closely."
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having been invaded, occupied, and liberated for the second time in the 20th century, Belgium is in a particularly tough time after World War II. Its industry and economy is ruined, military extremely small, and colonial affairs stable, but shaky at best. Politically speaking, Belgium is a democracy, but the King holds great power in the minds of the people, as well as rumblings from the Belgian Communists..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After centuries of foreign oppression, the newly proclaimed Dominion of India, has finally earned it's place on the world stage, and through the carnage of two world wars, the threat of famine and the terrible onslaught in the Pacific War, the Indian people are on the verge of attaining the independence that so many have fought and died in the hopes of achieving.\nBut such efforts carry a heavy price; the fires lit in the hearts of the Indian people by the likes Gandhi could become a nationalist inferno if left unchecked, and with the legacy of Subhas Chandra Bose's failed 'Azad Hind' in the east combined with anger over the newly created states of Pakistan and Myanmar, the Indian people must tread carefully if their new nation is to survive.The Indian people must tread carefully if the new nation of India is to survive."
 OTHER_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Second World War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 KEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is not the model colony to say the very least. While most residents of the mainland UK may hardly ever think of this nation of their empire with its 6 million people living in a collection of four major cities and mostly minor towns, the African majority of Kenya thinks of their British subject status regularly. Established at the climax of the scramble for Africa, Kenya as a colony is mainly populated by the ethnic Kikuyu people with a notable level of local British business and settlement. Like in every African colony, there is a small minority of anti-colonial and pan-Africanist student youth and intelligentsia in Kenya mainly organized around the activist Jomo Kenyatta. However, the largely illiterate rural people of the country are the real threat to colonial stability in Kenya as traveling prophets and mystics form militias in the countryside of the central highlands."
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mother Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Empire is a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse nation home to about 18 million people. Ethiopia is plagued by drought and famine with most of its citizens being illiterate serfs who only speak their regional language, if the crown wishes to modernize its country as it intends to, it will need to address these major issues. As the reconstruction of Ethiopia following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War comes to completion, the Ethiopian Empire appears to be at the height of its stability. As the only relevant independent African nation, Ethiopia has many opportunities available to them in this time lacking internal conflict. With the internationalist foreign policy of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia will likely find itself branching out to the world even farther in this new era defined by superpower rivalry."
 VIE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Guided by the French, State of Vietnam is opposite of the communist Viet Minh. Only time will tell who shall prevail."
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "South Africa emerged from the Allied victory with its prestige and national honor enhanced as it had fought tirelessly for the Western Allies. South Africa's standing in the international community was rising, at a time when the Third World's struggle against colonialism had still not taken center stage. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international body to preserve peace; he was determined that, unlike the League of Nations, the United Nations would have teeth. However, internal political struggles in the disgruntled and essentially impoverished Afrikaner community would soon come to the fore leading to Smuts' defeat at the polls in the 1948 elections at the hands of a resurgent National Party after the war. Now, the National Party is on its way to build institutionalized segregation in the country with its Apartheid system."
 NGA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nigeria in the 1950s is a colony filled with ethnic tension that's bundled tight by the colonial regime under chains of autocratic feudalism lead by the northern region's Hausa-Fulani. Nigeria can be seen as Africa's perfect example of Britain's policy of indirect rule as the two secondary ethnic groups, the entrepreneurial Igbos and artistic Yoruba's egalitarian societies are kept in check by the more populous and powerful northerners, the Hausa-Fulani. Unlike Kenya where native politics are suppressed by local British business interest, here there are very prominent political parties (though their voters are entirely based on ethnic lines) vying for representation in the colonial assembly with the Igbo National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons under Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe and Yoruba	 Obafemi Awolowo's Action Group being opposition to the Northern People's Congress of Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa"
 DECADE_CRISIS_NAME:0 "The Decade of Crisis"
 DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The process of decolonization has seen nations achieve freedom peacefully or through violence in Asia. Now, African peoples agitate for freedom with greater fervor as the imperial powers face the growing wave of decolonization. In the Middle East, Arab Nationalism promises to bring glory and destroy the old order. The United States and Soviet Union rivalry has become an all-out struggle for global influence. Some states are increasingly disenchanted of both Soviet and American machinations. They wish to lead their own destinies and it remains to be seen if these states can survive in this bipolar world order."
 ETH_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Ethiopia coming into the 1960s is being bombarded by the ideas of the modern world. Ethiopia is increasingly trying to prove it's relevance in this time of decolonization and instability in Africa as Haile Selassie tries to compete with rising pan-Africanist personalities, he has neglected domestic policy in focusing on foreign policy. While most of Ethiopia is entirely illiterate and uneducated, in the government and among the intelligentsia there is increasingly more criticism to the autocratic nature of Haile Selassie's rule and his failures to modernize at the expense of the nobility. In this era a leader can't expect to stay in power based on their dynastic legitimacy, this idea was made so clear to the leaders of Ethiopia when the Free Officers in Egypt ended the century and a half old Muhammad Ali dynasty."
 KEN_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Though the Mau Mau uprising is over, new adversity is coming to Kenya. While many see the decolonization of the British Empire as inevitable there is in contrast a strong, very vocal, group of British settlers and businessmen in the colonial assembly. With the main anti-colonialist activist, Jomo Kenyatta in prison currently time will only tell how Kenya will come into the world as a new independent nation."
 OILCRISIS_NAME:0 "The Oil Crisis"
 OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "The Cold War rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union appears relaxed but this can easily change in an ever-changing world. Decolonization appears almost complete, though Portugal clings on. Across the globe, regional rivalries and conflicts threaten to engulf not just neighboring states but also the wider world. Global demands for energy have shifted economic power and influence, especially to oil producing states. The non-aligned movement continues, but superpower pressure continues. However, within the superpower camps, nations increasingly seek to assert themselves. Time will tell if this period of détente is simply the calm before the storm."
 USA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United States of America is a major player on the capitalist block. After Cuba and China fell completely into communism, they are willing to intervene in every way to stop communism rise in other Asian countries or in Latin America. They have recovered western Europe and secured capitalist dominance over it, now it is time to secure capitalist dominance over the world."
 SOV_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has de-Stalinized their politics and stabilized their internal problems. Now focusing on exploring space and getting their influence across by uniting the workers of the world and implementing communist government on many countries. The Soviet Union is rising. Will the economic growth, and political dominance of the USSR continue or will the Americans turn the table?"
 DDR_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The German Democratic Republic, under Ulbricht has continued to follow the Soviet Union on most of its matters with relative success. However, as the new decade comes, the GDR is still plagued by many problems, most notable being the Republikflucht, in which the citizens of GDR escape to west. Along with economic and internal problems, Ulbricht must act soon or risk being ousted, or worse."
 PRC_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The People's Republic of China emerged victorious from the Chinese civil war. With the Kuomintang banished to Taiwan, Mao has focused on his vision of making China great. During this however he has faced many obstacles. Will Mao succeed or will he be forgotten to history?"
 CUB_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Cuba, now under Castro turned communist just a year ago. Unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. While the US first reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. It remains to be seen what the future brings. It sure won't be peace."
 VIE_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955, with Ngo Dinh Diem as its first president. A total opposite to the communist North, the south is supported by the US. The situation resembles the Korean situation. Will this lead to war as well?"
 FRA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of France has just reformed under De Gaulle as the Fifth Republic, which emerged from the collapse of the Fourth Republic, replacing the former parliamentary republic with a semi-presidential system. De Gaulle, who was the first French President elected under the Fifth Republic in December 1958, believes in a strong head of state, which he describes as embodying l'esprit de la nation ("the spirit of the nation")."
 ENG_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom, with the recent Suez crisis is in a tight spot. With rising independence movement, many expect to see the end of the British empire soon. Along with the crumbling empire, the country has seen the rise of communism which could develop into a bigger problem."
 ZIM_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Since 1953, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have been in a unstable federation. Now, with the new century, many are wondering will the federation last or collapse? Increasing nationalism in all three subjects might be too tough to handle."
 NGA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Thanks to a concerted effort by the political groups of the country, Nigeria is just nearing its planned independence in October. Native politicians have finally been able to form a government with the largest party, the Hausa-Fulani dominant Northern People's Congress making a coalition with the Igbo Nnamdi Akizikwe's party, National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons. With it appearing that Abubakar Tafawa Balewa will be the Nation's first Prime Minister time will only tell whether he will address the ethnic tension of Nigeria created by the British policy of northern dominance. Particularism and regionalism are very notable sentiments in the South East and West, if these issues are not dealt with in a direct and immediate way conflict could escalate into full scale violence."
 1990_DESC:0 "The end of communism is near. With increasing desire to join the west, many communist countries are about to change their governments. With the Soviets in bad shape, they ."
 1945_DESC:0 "The most devastating war in the history of mankind is finally over. Germany & Austria are occupied by the UK, the USA, France and the Soviet Union, while Asia erupts into chaos following the surrender of Japan. Fascism is finally defeated, but communism is now rising."
 YUG_1990_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia is falling apart. Since Tito's death, ethnic tensions have been rising across the nation. Now, with the start of a new decade, these tensions might escalate into violence. Will the Balkans be on fire once more?"

 PRC_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "The PRC is in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and immense change. Socialist education continues abreast, with young, urban Chinese workers being sent to the countryside for re-education. Chairman Mao remains in power but there is already discussion of who can possibly succeed the father of socialism in China.  Tensions with the Soviets remain high as both socialist giants pursue their visions of a socialist society. Hostility remains with the Republic of China, with both states continuing to engage each other diplomatically and through proxy conflicts. Many see the recent breakthrough in relations with the United States as an opportunity to counter the Soviet threat and potentially isolate the ROC."

After the inevitable power struggle, President Hafez stood in top to implement his Corrective Movement to shape the Syria we know today. His ambition has been as well, to avenge the earlier defeat and liberate every inch of lost Syrian land. He secretly kept busy with the re-organization of the Syrian Armed Forces into the Soviet model, and he now believes the Lion of the Levant will claim the glory denied."

 ETH_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "While it has taken the Ethiopian student youth and intelligentsia several decades longer to plant themselves firmly in specific international ideologies, these movements were always inevitable in their fruition due to the sturdy, unchanging status quo of the Imperial Monarchy. The last decade saw the first forming of Marxist and Agrarian Socialist parties in the country along with an attempted reformist coup against the monarchy; which though inscrutable from the outside, still maintains far flung consequence in the ethos of the carefully conspiring generals and young officers of the nation. No, the question is not will the Ethiopian Empire devolve into revolution, it is a matter of when - regardless of any reformative measures the Lion of Judah can take."

 SUEZCRISIS_DESC:0 "The world is once again close to a total war. As Gamal Abdel Nasser has nationalized the Suez canal, some nations are seeing this as a conflict of interest. The British and the French more specificity. However, Israel might also get on board with the plan. The question is; What happens next?"
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the end of the Infamous Decade, the approval of women's suffrage, and the election of Peron, Argentina seems to be on course to democracy. Peron is midway through his presidency, and already it seems that he will shake up the Argentinian economy and its people."
 VIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vietnam has been abandoned by the French. All attempts at independence have failed. Bao Dai, the Japanese collaborator, is the enemy of the Viet Minh once more. The blood spilled in the razing of Hanoi by Chinese imperialists will be repaid in French blood. Vietnam's struggle is now one against Western imperialism, and Ho Chi Minh now looks towards communism to win his battles."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France is heavily split. From the Renault Strike in 1947 to the bread riots of Le Mans and Verdun and the occupation of communist newspapers, the country is ready to fall into chaos. It must also face rebellions in Madagascar and Indochina, but must ensure that its home does not fall into rebellion as well. Rationing and strikes have characterized France this far, but it is impossible to ration a country forever. Will France and its empire endure or fall?"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second World War was traumatic to Spain. Francisco Franco watched as his fellow fascists fell in battle against the Allies. The Falange still controls the Spanish population, and with the beginning of the Cold War, it is unlikely if anything in Spain will change. Authoritarianism has kept Spain stable yet isolated, and few want change, but there is always the chance of change."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The eyes of both East and West have focused their gaze on Greece. The effects of the war have not worn off for Greece; the economy is sluggish and the country is more divided than ever. In the power vacuum left by the Italian surrender, Greek communist partisans rose up in the hopes of creating a new, Soviet-aligned, Hellenic nation. The Greek Civil War has been transformed into a proxy war between the Warsaw Pact and the former Allied Forces. Stalin is quite clearly eyeing up Greece as a bastion of Soviet influence in the Aegean sea but the legitimate Greek government shall do everything within their power to preserve the freedom and sovereignty of its people."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Eight Years War Of Resistance has finally ended with the explosive finale to Japanese imperialism. This is, of course, cause for much celebration - but the Kuomintang government cannot afford to celebrate to the point of distraction. There is still great danger to the nationalist governments, for with the lack of threat from Japan, China has become divided once more. Thanks to Soviet help, the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong have greatly expanded the territory they occupy, to the point of being a dangerous rival to the ROC. For now, the Chinese Civil War rages on and every effort must be spent on crushing the communists."

 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iran has suffered much after the occupation by Soviet and British forces for five years and the removal of previous Shah Reza Pahlavi from power. His son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, became the British-endorsed replacement. The mild Shah would do little in his first years in power, leading to the creation of a loose democratic body. The prime minister and parliament now hold considerable power over the nation with the Shah taking a backseat in politics. As Iran enters into a crossroads to a new era, will the country, struggling with internal and external conflicts, continue on its path of democracy or be subdued by the many adversaries of the fledgling government?"
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finland's independence and international position since the end of World War 2 have been frequently described as unique or baffeling.

With the dawn of the cold war, Finland has wowed to stay neutral. But with the rapidly changing world situtation, will they be able to balance the East and the West?"
