Any nations who do not vote to unite, shall be outcast from the brotherhood of the Arab people as traitor states, and shall be dealt with later...\n However we may attempt the more acceptable compromise of formally creating a faction for the security and prosperity of the Arab World."

 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.01.d:0 "\nAfter months of negotiation with our authorities, the Arab League has voted to take a joint step into a prosperous future. The vote came after several weeks of testimonies, debates, and arguments over the resolution. Representatives from the Arab League seek to forge a strong relation, which may lead to greater things, and perhaps even membership to NATO, and a place under the Western defensive umbrella. The goodwill in relations shall last for a few years at least, or until the next major incident... "
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.1.d:0 "In a recent session of the Arab League, our nation was openly condemned for human rights violations in a resolution. This action greatly harms our international image and tourism. More significantly, it empowers enemies of the state and opponents to act more blatant as global scrutiny intensifies on our actions. There are senior government officials who believe the resolution should act as a wakeup call and we must act to reassure the international community and our people that our nation is one of justice. Another group of senior officials claim the Arab League vote was the result of propaganda and potentially a dangerous internal plot against us. They argue we must not stop our necessary policies, but we can certainly work to hide them more from the public eye."

 ##condemn colonialism
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Condemn [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] Colonialism"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.2.d:0 "\nThe Arab League passed a powerful resolution condemning the colonialism of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective]. During the debates that occurred before the vote, many members noted that the Right of Self-Determination is a vital principle of the Arab League Charter and [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] has failed to offer its colonial subjects any avenue to freedom or their future status. Many members were unimpressed by the counter-arguments presented, and it appears most members are convinced [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] has failed to offer its colonies adequate say over its administration or political future. The representatives of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] refused to make an official statement as they left the Arab League to consult their leadership. The vote is being seen as a major victory for anti-colonial activists across the planet."
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.3.t:0 "Arab League Votes to Condemn [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] 'Colonialism'"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.3.d:0 "A recent Arab League resolution condemned the colonial possessions of our nation. The Arab League resolution did not acknowledge all we have provided those areas in terms of security, education, and economy, but regardless the resolution is a huge blow to our international image. No doubt miscreants and misguided elements in the colonies will be emboldened to strike or embarrass us further. We can certainly maintain our policies and presence in the colonies, though at the risk of further Arab League sanctions. Several senior military and colonial officials were quick to note their preference for this option. Or we can consider the possibility of preparing decolonization plans, to counter the negative international attention on us. Some senior officials believe it is possible to release these states and maintain a strong influence, though this cannot be guaranteed."

 ## contain foreign influence
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Contain [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] Influence"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.4.d:0 "\nA new resolution passed by the Arab League formally informed [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] it must no longer expand its resources to gain influence over other states. Many members argued the activities of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] led to destabilization, economic hardship, and could threaten the sovereignty of too many states. Many appeared to be convinced by discussions claiming the actions of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] were akin to producing a new type of colonialism, hidden from the public eye. After the vote, several representatives noted the practices of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] were nefarious and to not act would risk the world returning to a situation of violent global competition."

 ## ban diplomats
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.5.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Freeze [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] National Assets"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.5.d:0 "\nAfter long debates, the Arab League voted to freeze the national assets of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective]. The members of the Arab League determined that the government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] was utilizing its funds inappropriately to the detriment of the global community and its people. This is a huge blow for the government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective]. After the vote, its representative informed the press that the results were not just disappointing but represented a setback in international norms concerning the sovereignty of individual states. The representative predicted such a vote will lead to further encroachments on the rights of nations and their people. Other nations released statements saying [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] breached so many acceptable norms that the result was inevitable."

 ##demand Arab states
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.6.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Sanction Prominent [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] Figures"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.6.d:0 "\nThe Arab League voted to sanction prominent figures within [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective]. These individuals are accused of a litany of crimes and corruption. The Arab League hopes the sanctions will pressure the government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] to either arrest or detain these individuals. The vote was praised by many in the media who saw the vote as targeting the main perpetrators and not punish a whole society or even government. Echoing this theme, one prominent diplomat told the media that the sanctions are meant to help the people of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetAdjective] clean house and achieve their aspirations. None of the individuals sanctioned were willing to make a statement over the matter."

 ##Arab trade sanctions
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Place Trade Sanction's on [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.7.d:0 "\nFollowing a bitterly contested debate, the Arab League voted to place extensive trade sanctions on [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]. The resolution noted the continuous violations of established norms and bad behaviors of the government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] in the resolution text. Several diplomats were quick to tell the media that the sanctions are not intended to hurt the people, but they had to be implemented in order to control the actions of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]. The government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] is said to be very upset over the resolution, blaming an international conspiracy and informing its people that they were being victimized and bullied by the Arab League."

 ##denounce internationally
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.8.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Arab League Votes to Place Weapons Trade Ban on [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.8.d:0 "\nThe Arab League passed a new resolution banning the purchasing of arms by the government of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]. Many member states agreed with the argument that the weapons acquired by [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] were far greater than it needed. In addition the member states felt [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] was diverting resources needed to aid its people over its excessive and threatening arms buildup. The Arab League ultimately concluded it had to act in order to prevent [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] from further destabilizing the international community. Representatives of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] released a short statement condemning the resolution as a violation of sovereignty and a direct attack on the ability of the nation to defend itself."

 ##enact oil embargo
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]United Nation Calls for an End to the [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] Nuclear Program"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.9.d:0 "\nThe Arab League passed a resolution calling for [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] to end its nuclear program. During the debate over the resolution, several nations noted the existential threat presented by these nuclear weapons for not just the region but the globe. Representatives of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] insisted they have a right to pursue and develop any technologies needed for the advancement and protection of the people. It added the Arab League resolution speaks to the biases and hypocrisy of the organization, but it plans on releasing a formal response after consulting the senior leadership. Other diplomats rejected such assertions, pointing out the risks were plain for the world to see and to not act would have itself been a grave error."

 ##request Arab loans
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.10.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]United Nation Calls for Removal of Weapons of Mass Destruction from [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName]"
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.10.d:0 "\nA fiery debate ended in the Arab League passing a resolution demanding [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] remove all its weapons of mass destruction. Diplomats from multiple states claimed [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] lacks the proper command and control procedures, restraint, and justification to produce, hold, or use such weapons. The Arab League resolution noted the removal of such weapons would further the prospects of peace in the region and reduce the possibility of armed conflict. The main representative of [arab_league_nation_global_target.GetName] claimed the debate and vote was done simply to humiliate his nation. He said an official response would be received as soon as he returned home to consult with the senior leadership."
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.11.d:0 "The Arab League voted on a resolution demanding we suspend our nuclear program and have the program go under Arab League supervision. During debates over the resolution it is clear the international community does not trust us to operate such weapons. We can accept the resolution and begin a denuclearization process. This would take the wind out of our opponents and show that we are a responsible member of the international community. It would also reduce the risk of an escalation. However, there are senior officials and military officers who note the nation sacrificed immense wealth, lives, and resources to establish a nuclear deterrence. To denuclearize would insult the nation and make it vulnerable. They add their fear that the Arab League resolution may be just a ploy to remove the nukes in preparation for an invasion by our enemies."
 ARAB_LEAGUE_RESOLUTION.12.d:0 "A recent resolution passed by the Arab League demanded we suspend and end our chemical weapons program. From the vote it is clear the international community views our program as a grave threat and to refuse may risk further actions by the Arab League. Accepting the resolution and beginning the process would no doubt end any escalation and some officials note that morally it may be the right thing to remove such weapons any ways. However, other officials, especially those in the military are urging we do not give in as these weapons are for national protection and are an internal matter. For them, the Arab League has no right to dictate what a sovereign state can do internally."
