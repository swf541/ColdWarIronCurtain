 BAN_FOR.1.d:0 "An intermediary nation brought a message from Bangladesh. They are asking for a normalization in our relations. Up to this point, we remained steadfast in supporting Pakistan by not engaging with the new state. However, the international situation is such we cannot ignore a new Asian state. Pakistan appreciates our support but will not hold it against us for opening ties. Bangladesh is strategically located along the Bay of Bengal and on the eastern border of India. It could potentially be a strong ally for us. We have two options, one is to establish friendly diplomatic relations, this will likely not hurt the feelings of Pakistan. The other option is to offer a trade and military aid pact to show our interest in a strategic partnership, this will likely annoy Pakistan."
 BAN_FOR.2.d:0 "The Chinese government agreed to establish full diplomatic relations with us. The former Chinese consulate in Dacca will be upgraded to a full embassy, a new ambassador is expected to be announced soon. We have also been invited to establish an embassy in Beijing. China remains a vital Asian power and establishing close ties will help ensure we are never completely dependent on India in the future. This is a major boost for our foreign policy and gives our people greater legitimacy internationally."
 BAN_FOR.3.d:0 "The Chinese government responded very positively to our call for diplomatic normalization. They have offered a pact to provide favorable trade terms and military aid. The proposed aid could help equip several infantry battalions with small arms. Our top military and economic leaders are very attracted to the proposal. However, top political and diplomatic experts note if we accept this support, we will alienate India. The Indians will not look kindly to an increased Chinese presence in our land. Instead, they believe we should appreciate the offer but stick to maintaining friendly ties. We must decide if the military aid and economic support is worth alienating our largest neighbor."
 BAN_FOR.4.d:0 "The newly independent state of Bangladesh recently requested we send experts to boost their economy and military. The government espouses a desire to adopt a socialist economic model to elevate its impoverished people. Our analysis note that although the government and its supporters support socialism, there are many Bangladeshis who have reservations. Especially within the military and among the conservative elements. Our aid could help the government achieve success and increasingly convince the population to eventually embrace a total socialist society. However, some of reports suggest the country is too undeveloped economically or socially to make our aid effective. It may be better to just focus on boosting ties. A decision will need to be made."
 BAN_FOR.5.d:0 "The government and media recently welcomed the arrival of Soviet experts to Dacca. More advisors are expected in the coming weeks as the advisory committee organizes itself in the country. We welcome these advisors offering support for the Finance and Defence Ministries. Socialism offers the cure for Bangladeshi poverty and class divisions. The Soviet experts will enjoy our full cooperation. The military has refused permission for any Soviet experts to visit or embed with any military headquarters or field units. They are citing security concerns, but over time we hope the more reactionary officers can be replaced."
 BAN_FOR.6.d:0 "The Bangladesh government privately reached out to ask for their share in federal assets. The Bangladeshis claim their province provided extensive financial support to the federal government and would like those remaining assets returned immediately. The situation puts us in an awkward situation. The Finance Ministry has the records and believes the government could return those specific assets collected from the former East Pakistan. Considering how they left the country, many in the cabinet would rather we do not give a cent. Others argue a portion could be returned, this would help our relations. Finally, we could return all the assets, which would go a long way to strengthen ties."
 BAN_FOR.7.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were pleasantly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next two years. This will boost our economy and help stabilize our own growth. However, the value of the assets appears to be only a small percentage of what is owed. The Pakistanis insist their offer cannot be increased. Regardless, it is significant they have agreed to give anything and will help our ties."
 BAN_FOR.8.d:0 "We recently requested the Pakistan government return those assets and capital held by the federal government from our provincial contributions to the center. We were not expecting a positive Pakistani response but were greatly surprised. The Pakistanis signed an agreement promising to return the assets over the next five years. This will boost our economy and stabilize our growth. The value offered by the Pakistanis matches our own calculations, it appears the Pakistanis are genuinely interested and willing to return the assets. This is a significant development and perhaps indicates a future of cooperation and brotherhood between our states."
 BAN_FOR.9.d:0 "Our ambassador in Dacca received a request from the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. The Minister called for our two nations to hold talks to demarcate the border. Currently, there are many enclaves within both our territories and the population in the borderlands finds the situation problematic. Resolving the border would potentially strengthen ties and make the border less chaotic for its residents. However, our experts note a number of our enclaves are essentially surrounded by Bangladesh. A demarcation could see us lose villages and citizens to Bangladesh. If that is a potential we can accept, than talks can occur, if not, we should politely decline the talks."
 BAN_FOR.10.d:0 "The Indian government has agreed to hold talks in Calcutta over our border. We are currently assembling a high-powered team and need to develop a negotiating strategy. The Indians indicated they want to hear our solutions to the issue and negotiate from there. One proposal we developed calls for both sides to cede the enclaves on the border to one another. This would change the national ownership of the enclave villages. Its residents could either stay and be given their new citizenship or repatriate. The other proposal would solidify the borders but require a population transfer. All Bangladeshis in enclaves taken by India would be returned and vice versa. The villagers would have no choice in this solution. We must decide what position to propose."
 BAN_FOR.11.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. The villagers will then be given the option to either take citizenship of their new nation or be repatriated. The Bangladeshis insists this will stabilize the border while providing villagers an option. Our own negotiators believe the agreement may help stabilize the border but gives only the illusion of choice to the villagers. Noting those who wish to retain their Indian citizenship would have to abandon home. This would put pressure on the local authorities to resettle those citizens, who may not be worth the headache. However, the negotiators also concede the agreement would end the enclave headache that has plagued the borderland since Partition."
 BAN_FOR.12.d:0 "We are holding talks with Bangladesh in Calcutta over our border. In particular, there is concern with regards to enclave villages held by both sides. The Bangladeshis proposed both sides cede those enclaves surrounded by the other power. However, they insist all residents in the enclaves be transferred, meaning our citizens in our enclaves would be transferred to us. We would also return Bangladeshi citizens back from their enclaves in India. This proposal would decisively resolve the issue, however, our negotiators have concerns. We have far more citizens who would be forcibly deported from their ancestral homes. This will likely raise tensions and put pressure on local authorities to resettle the refugees. The government should decide a response."
 BAN_FOR.13.d:0 "Border talks in Calcutta between Bangladesh and India failed to resolve tensions. Currently, there are hundreds of enclaves on both sides of the border and extensive confusion, coupled with occasional border clashes. The Bangladeshis were keen on resolving the issue of the enclaves. However, the Indians were more interested in the enclave residents. The Indian government insists any solution to the enclaves should offer the opportunity for residents to keep their national identity and access to ancestral lands. The Bangladeshi government views this as unrealistic. Despite the failure, both sides agreed to continue positive discussions on all outstanding issues."
 BAN_FOR.14.d:0 "After talks in Calcutta, India and Bangladesh agreed to resolve their border dispute with a population transfer. All residents of enclaves will be asked to choose their national identity. Those Bangladeshis residing in enclaves on the Indian side of the border will be repatriated. Similarly, Indian citizens in enclaves in Bangladesh will also be moved to India. The process will take several months, but both sides expect it to resolve much of the border tensions. The Bangladeshi public is not happy with the result, believing the government gave up more as they controlled most of the enclaves. However, the Bangladeshi and Indian government emphasized the decision will be mutually beneficial for everyone involved."

 BAN_ECON.1.d:0 "The people of Bangladesh deserve peace and prosperity. Our people were victims of colonial exploitation for centuries and now control their own destiny. The government recently received two proposed five-year plans. One, developed by leading political leaders and academics envisions a nation transitioning to socialism. This plan offers an ambitious effort to provide dynamic thinking for the growth of society. The other plan, developed by the traditional bureaucratic institutions, offers a more modest series of reforms, meant to transition Bangladesh into a stable, independent economy. Many in the government favor the academic plan as it offers a new approach to economic development and breaks from the traditional mechanisms. However, too rapid a change could cause problems for the fledging state."
 BAN_ECON.2.d:0 "Jute remains one of the most vital industries in Bangladesh and historically a source of our exploitation. The British and then Pakistanis ran the jute mills, draining the wealth from the nation. With independence, many of these jute mills are sitting inactive. Some recommended the government auction these industries to private businesses and corporations. However, this would only encourage a new wave of exploitation. The government will begin the process of nationalizing these jute mills and bring them into operation. The workers and mills are now under the control of the Bangladesh Jute Mill."
 BAN_ECON.3.d:0 "A recent report notes jute production in the country is far lower than during the pre-independence period. Expenses at the mill are also far higher. The unions are being accused of providing excessive difficulties to the administrators. The administration also faced stinging criticism in the report. Its members are accused of absenteeism and being unqualified. Many members of the Bangladesh Jute Board are political appointees with little to know knowledge of the industry. Despite these major setbacks, the government insists it will not privatize the mills, though it has promised reforms to curb inefficiencies. There are plans to end the Bangladesh Jute Board and place it under the Finance Ministry."
 BAN_ECON.4.d:0 "A committee of economists and senior civil service officials recently published a report after investigating the government-run Bangladesh Jute Board. They noted efforts at reforming inefficiencies have been ineffective. Unions remain difficult to manage, especially with an administration staffed by members with little experience in business or the jute industry. The recent reform of creating a separate Jute Ministry to cut costs has had little impact. The report recommends the government begins privatizing the mills which are a drain on the finances of the country. However, the years of commitment towards state control means complete privatization is not possible. The government plans on slowly privatizing some jute mills to assess the situation."
 BAN_ECON.5.d:0 "Following recommendations from an expert committee, the government recently privatized around a dozen jute mills. In addition, the government initiated several incentives to spur growth. However, a recent assessment concludes the private jute mills are producing at the same or only slightly higher than government run mills. This is disappointing news for the economy, though the report gives more ammunition to those advocating the government not give up its stake in the industry completely. The government said it will curtail the pace of privatization but continue to provide incentives and subsidies to the industry."
 BAN_ECON.10.d:0 "The Finance Ministry released a series of regulations to codify industrial relations between the management and workers. These are meant to better lay out exactly what legal recourse both sides have in regards to negotiations or declaring strikes. Worker groups are criticizing the decision, noting Bangladesh still lacks vital legislation on the issue, giving factory owners an unfair advantage. The leading business association also criticized the regulations as a roadmap to allow workers to effectively carry out protests without violating the law. Despite these criticisms, the Finance Ministry insists the decision will help resolve current conflicts and spur more legislation in the future."
 BAN_ECON.11.d:0 "Jute is a vital industry for Bangladesh. During colonial period, the jute produced in the land went to what is now India for processing. Despite the potential and promises, little has been done to build a processing capability in Bangladesh itself. To rectify this, new incentives and protections are being offered internationally to encourage foreign investment in the jute industry. Bangladesh has a potential for great growth but needs to do so with help from finance abroad. Diplomatic missions will soon begin publicizing the new opportunities."
 BAN_ECON.12.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore some fruit. We attracted funding from some development organizations and a few investment groups. However, this is less than we anticipated when launching the effort. It appears most people still view our nation as a risky investment. Despite this, we are able to expand some of our processing capabilities which will provide a boon for the economy. More importantly, it allows us to benefit more by exporting products produced from jute instead of just the raw material."
 BAN_ECON.13.d:0 "Our efforts at encouraging foreign investment to expand jute processing facilities bore fruit. Diplomatic missions and the Finance Ministry were bombarded with requests from investment groups and organizations interested in the proposed program. It appears our nation is seen by many as a land of opportunity. We are able to not just greatly expand the processing of jute in the country but also have attracted enough foreign partners to maximize profit opportunities. This is a major success for the people of Bangladesh."
 BAN_ECON.14.d:0 "We are currently receiving some new interest for foreign investments in Bangladesh. The Finance Ministry believes it will be in the interest of the nation if we can focus on a specific developmental area to maximize this increase. Some experts believe we should direct this support towards building up infrastructure across the nation. Other experts see a focus on developing energy as being paramount to building a foundation for future economic growth. Some of the top political leadership insists the focus should be on new industries to provide more jobs to the people. A decision must be made soon."
 BAN_ECON.15.d:0 "The previous Pakistan regime continued to hold large tracts of land it inherited from the British regime. The military later on seized more land, ostensibly for security reasons. After an extensive survey, the government has identified large amounts of agriculturally viable land that can be returned to the peasants. It just needs to be determined how to distribute the land. One option is to redistribute the land to landless peasants. The other option calls for the public sale of these lands. Supporters of the former believe this will rectify the continued oppression of peasants in the nation. Those wanting a public sale note if someone buys the land, they will likely put in the investment necessary to make it worthwhile."
 BAN_ECON.16.d:0 "Our peasants are infuriated by the decision to publicly sell-off excess government lands. They argue this land should have been returned to the people who desperately need it. Many peasant families claim they have virtually no opportunity to gain land are increasingly being coerced to work under landlords. Certain officials are being accused of massively profiting from the sales. There are increasing incidents of peasants refusing to work or reducing the amount of work put in to protest what they see as a dire situation."

 Rahman_Assasination.1.d:0 "There is chaos in Dacca following reports that armed, uniformed men stormed the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There are reports of explosions and gunfire from the residence. Bangladeshis are said to be in a state of apprehension as they try to understand what is occurring. The recent uptake in violence, crime, and an economic crisis has greatly eroded the popularity of the President. The military in particular is said to the perturbed by these crises as it finds itself engaged in a conflict with the radical socialist JSD."
 Rahman_Assasination.2.d:0 "State media in Bangladesh confirmed that patriotic military officers were responsible for the assault on the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The officers then went on the air to confirm they had killed Mujibur Rahman to save the nation. Among the confirmed dead are his two sons, who were seen as his future successors. His two daughters are in West Germany. Just several years earlier, millions cheered Mujibur Rahman as their champion, however, the reaction to his death is largely subdued. It appears the economic crisis and other domestic issues have largely depleted his standing among the people. It is unclear exactly who is now in charge of the government. The military continues to remain silent on their roll in this coup. The officers involved are of mid-level ranks and the higher ranked officers appear to be just as shocked by the coup as the people."
 Rahman_Assasination.3.d:0 "In an unprecedented development, Khondaker Mostaq Khan has proclaimed himself the new President of Bangladesh. He is a noted nationalist leader and member of the executive committee. The new leader appeared to have taken over with support from the coup leaders. Analysts believe the coup plotters believed their low ranks made them vulnerable but the new President will legitimize their action. The new President did work with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Prior to joining the executive committee, he had served as a minister for the government. Some experts believe his selection as President is meant to appease the armed wing of the Awami League and prevent either a counter-coup or foreign intervention. The people of Bangladesh are left waiting to see what the future holds for them."
 Rahman_Assasination.4.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan took over as President after being approached by the Awami League leadership following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The new present must now decide what to do with the assassins. It is clear the assassins approved his appointment on the condition he grant them immunity. If this is not given, there is a high possibility of another, more violent coup by the heavily armed, junior officers. The other option is to take no opinion on the assassination and defer it to the military justice system. This decision will determine the destiny of the new government."
 Rahman_Assasination.5.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Khan addressed the nation. He praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for saving the nation from destruction. He also called for national reconciliation. As part of this plan, he announced a new Indemnity Ordinance. This will give full immunity to the assassins, who are already receiving senior positions in the new government. Many Bangladeshis are said to be shocked by the decision, though there are no reports of unrest. However, the Awami League and its most die hard members will be infuriated over the lack of justice for their late leader. There are already rumors in Dacca that the new President faces a high risk of an Awami League reaction, as many wish to see Mujibur Rahman avenged."
 Rahman_Assasination.6.d:0 "If the regime of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan is to survive, the military must be brought under control. The initial coup had been launched by mid level officers, but they lack the authority or status to assert control over the military. The current Army Chief, General Shafiullah was a strong supporter of Mujibur Rahman and did not see the coup coming. If he is retained, it may maintain order, but puts the government at risk considering his political views. Many officials are recommending General Shafiullah be retired and replaced by General Ziaur Rahman. General Rahman is seen as a conservative officer, not likely to be influenced by the Mujibur Rahman loyalists. However, his is an ambitious officer, promoting him may give the military more influene over the state."
 Rahman_Assasination.7.d:0 "The late President Mujibur Rahman sought to consolidate his power through his BakSAL party. President Khondaker Mostaq Khan announced he would immediately breakup BakSAL and allow all political parties to return. He noted the one-state party left many Bangladeshis to feel disenfranchised or uninvolved with the politics of the country. Restoring political parties will bring back the rich political activism of the people and restore a more democratic character to Bangladesh. The move is being widely praised, though there are some concerns. Many politicians fear the religious parties may take advantage of this new situation and try to manipulate the electorate by playing on religious sentiments. The President dismissed these concerns and noted his belief in the compatibility of Islam and democracy."
 Rahman_Assasination.8.d:0 "Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the ascension of President Khondaker Mostaq Khan to office, senior Awami League leaders were detained. The new President recognized his position was very precarious with regards not only to the military officers who carried out the assassination but to Mujibur loyalists in the party. These loyalists, though detained, still wield tremendous influence and could potentially stir a violent response from the militant wing of the Awami Party. Some senior officials are recommending the President should remove these Awami League opponents, before they either escape from prison or are released. They could easily rally a hostile opposition to the government. Other advisors believe this may backfire, they urge reconciliation. Releasing the political prisoners could buy good will. A decision must be made."
 Rahman_Assasination.9.d:0 "General Khaled Mosharaf, a highly decorated, senior Bangladeshi officer, working with pro-Mujibur Rahman military units, seized control of the government overnight. General Khaled Mosharaf, outraged by the assassination and protection of the assassins acted following reports that senior Awami League officials were killed in prison under suspicious circumstances. The current Army Chief, senior government officials, including President Khondaker Mostaq Khan and the assassins of Mujibur Rahman are either in detention or house arrest. In an address to the nation, Khaled Mosharaf promised to bring the killers of Mujibur Rahman to justice and restore chain of command in the military. Within hours of the announcement, thousands marched to commemorate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, no longer fearing reprisals from the government. General Mosharaf has claimed the position of Army Chief and President."
 Rahman_Assasination.10.d:0 "The chaos in Bangladesh continues following reports of a mutiny by soldiers opposed to the coup of General Khaled Mosharaf. The mutiny is being led by left-wing soldiers and officers, being directed by retired Colonel and JSD leader Abu Taher. The mutineers are arresting, killing, attacking officers loyal to General Mosharaf or the late Mujibur Rahman. Apparently, many of the mutinying soldiers believe the new leader is an Indian agent, bent on surrendering Bangladesh to India. Although Mosharaf claimed the title Army Chief from General Ziaur Rahman, the claim is not being recognized within the ranks. There are reports of intense fighting across the capital and around the home where Ziaur Rahman is currently being held. Time will tell what will happen."
 Rahman_Assasination.11.d:0 "Hours after reports of a leftist, military uprising, the situation in Bangladesh has changed again. General Khaled Mosharaf, who only days earlier overthrew the government, was killed during a counter-coup launched by revolting soldiers. General Ziaur Rahman, was released from his house arrest and has taken control of the government, reclaiming his title as Army Chief. Acting swiftly, General Ziaur ordered the immediate restoration of discipline and chain of command. Pro-Mosharaf officers and soldiers are under detention. All remaining political prisoners held by either the late General Mosharaf or the former President Khondaker Mostaq Khan are to be released or shifted to house arrest until a decision can be made. The leftist soldiers who released Ziaur were seeking a new socialist government, however, General Ziaur declared he will take over the situation without a socialist government or junta."
 Rahman_Assasination.12.d:0 "In the weeks following both a coup and counter-coup, General Ziaur Rahman has firmly restored order in the country and within the military. Officers and soldiers involved in both coup plots are being swiftly detained. Most notably, the retired Colonel Abu Taher, who influenced the coup which facilitated his release from house arrest was also detained. General Ziaur noted the uprising against General Mosharaf sought not to restore order but bring a socialist military state into power. If discipline is to be restored, all these movements must be stamped out of the barracks. In addition to restoring order in the military, General Ziaur has overseen an extensive deployment of security forces to lower lawlessness and restore order across the country. Many Bangladeshis are welcoming a new sense of calm and order being brought by the new regime."
 Rahman_Assasination.13.d:0 "A military tribunal convicted Colonel Abu Taher to hang for his crimes of treason and murder. The former JSD leader is accused of overseeing anti-state activities during the insurgency period. He was also accused of arranging the assassination of General Khaled Mosharaf and other officers loyal to him to facilitate a brutal socialist takeover of Bangladesh. His execution does not bode well for his own supporters within the Army, as many assumed they would enjoy immunity as their actions helped facilitate the return of General Ziaur to power. However, General Ziaur recognizes the influence of outside ideologies and personalities were crippling the discipline and order within the Army. His mass detention and trials of prominent military officers involved in recent coups are meant to restore discipline in the barracks."
 Rahman_Assasination.14.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, the Army Chief of Bangladesh, and popular war hero, has overthrown President Khondaker Mostaq Khan. The General acted following reports that several Awami League members died under mysterious circumstances in prison. For General Shafiullah, this was the last draw. A prominent Mujibur Rahman supporter, he had been shocked by his assassination but helped keep the nation together in the aftermath. However, the failure of President Mostaq Khan to bring the assassins to justice and the recent suspicious jailhouse killings made the situation intolerable for the general and his senior officers. Bangladeshi troops are out on the streets. In an address to the nation, the new leader promised justice for the late Mujibur Rahman and stability for a nation rocked by instability."
 Rahman_Assasination.15.d:0 "Retired Colonel Abu Taher, a former leader in the JSD, organized a Marxist uprising from junior officers and soldiers loyal to the vision of a socialist revolution. The leftist soldiers rapidly moved to seize control of major formations and assassinate General K.M. Shafiullah. There are reports of sporadic fighting across military cantonments in the country. The residence of the Army Chief is also said to be a scene of intense firing. It appears Colonel Taher is seeking to take advantage of the current instability in the country in order to establish a revolutionary socialist state. The coming hours will reveal any changes to the situation on the ground."
 Rahman_Assasination.16.d:0 "The leftist counter-coup against General K.M. Shafiullah has collapsed in disorder. The popular Army Chief was able to rally his supporters and issue commands rapidly during the violence. His own loyal troops were able to halt an assassination team from targeting the general at his home. Thousands of rebel soldiers, officers, and civilian sympathizers are under detention. They are expected to face trial. Colonel Abu Taher, who organized the attempt, was killed during the fighting. Addressing the nation, General Shafiullah praised the armed forces for remaining steadfast in their duty to the nation. With his rule firmly consolidated, he can now focus on restoring the revolution, as envisioned by the late Mujibur Rahman."
 Rahman_Assasination.17.d:0 "The JSD, taking advantage of the military infighting between the senior commanders, has captured a number of military installations. Pro-JSD officers and soldiers within several bases joined with the rebels outside to seize the facilities. The action has successfully cut off a few senior officers from their own loyal units. An attempt to organize a unified response by General Khaled Mosharaf failed as many units continue to refuse his commands or recognize him as the Army Chief. Abu Taher, the leader of the JSD and a former colonel, is said to be coordinating the JSD movements from a recently captured communications center."
 Rahman_Assasination.18.d:0 "The tumultuous effort by General Khaled Mosharaf to seize power ended in his assassination. The details remain sketchy, but it is believed rebel soldiers, perhaps loyal to the JSD, shot him as he coordinated operations against his opposition. The JSD leader Abu Taher soon announced on state radio that the JSD had seized control and would bring the people security. Military vehicles are now patrolling the streets, carrying mixed groups of JSD fighters and pro-JSD soldiers. Those senior officers who opposed Khaled Mosharaf and the JSD are believed to be in JSD custody. The chaotic infighting among the senior military leaders opened the way for a full JSD takeover."

 Khondaker_Regime.1.d:0 "There is increased tension within the military. The professional officers, trained during the colonial and Pakistan period continue to assert themselves as the most elite officers in the military. The freedom fighters and youth wing fighters from before independence were integrated into the military after independence. Those promoted to officers are complaining the professional officers marginalize them, preventing their promotions. The professional officers are demanding we support their policy of converting the integrated elements into their vision for the Army. The former freedom fighters advocate the establishment of a more national, peoples army. The President must decide which faction to back."
 Khondaker_Regime.2.d:0 "President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad praised the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a recent speech. He called the assassins sons of the sun for their actions. He claimed had the officers not acted, the government and nation faced the risk of total collapse. In his concluding remarks, he called for the nation to come together and ended his speech with Bangladesh Zindabad. Notably changing the previous slogan from Joy Bangla. The remarks are being received with a reaction of surprise and anger. Many Bangladeshis are now convinced their new leader was involved in the assassination. Loyalists to the late Mujibur Rahman are said to be infuriated by the remarks."
 Khondaker_Regime.3.d:0 "There is an increased fear among Bangladeshis that India enjoys too many privileges and influence in the country. This feeling is especially prevalent among the officer corps. The government will implement a new foreign policy to reduce Indian influence on the country. We will increase restrictions on border crossings, call for India to reduce its diplomatic missions, and implement more trade restrictions. We leaked some news ahead of time and the public seems to agree with this new direction in policy. The Indians must know they cannot infringe on our sovereignty."
 Khondaker_Regime.4.d:0 "The cabinet noted the previous policy of nationalizing the economy had occurred far too rapidly in the country. It stated support for a society where workers, the nation, and economy could all flourish together. However, expert reports confirmed the state lacked the capacity to effectively run all the industries it had nationalized. As such, the cabinet decided on a program to privatize a percentage of government industries. The government hopes this will spur spending and drive dynamic growth in the economy. Several unions and Awami League officials expressed concern over the decision. However, for many Bangladeshis suffering in a stagnant economy, they are willing to try anything for growth."

 Shafiullah.1.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, met with his senior military commanders to discuss the fate of those who killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. One group of officers believe a public trial should occur in which the brutal details of the assassination can be understood by the population. Then the killers can be executed to provide justice to the whole nation. However, another group of officers worry such a trial could lead to backlash against the military as a whole. Instead, they argue the killers should be tried in a private court martial, to minimize anti-military rhetoric and show the nation how the military deals with traitors. President Shafiullah must make a difficult decision."
 Shafiullah.2.d:0 "The public trial of those military officers involved in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ended today. The nation was stunned to hear how a group of mid-level officers armed themselves, stormed the Rahman residence, and butchered him, along with his family. Only by not being in the country were his two daughters spared. The prosecution hinted that senior military officers may have privately facilitated the coup, however, the government already announced there would be no other trials. The eight assassins, including three majors, all claimed they acted to save the nation from corruption and dictatorship. The verdict will be announced in a few days, with many expecting a guilty verdict followed by an execution."
 Shafiullah.3.d:0 "The Bangladesh military announced its court martial would soon release the verdict of the eight men involved in assassinating the late President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Details of the trial were kept from the general public. The military claimed the case was under military jurisdiction and it would see justice be done. Though there was some initial public discontent over the privacy in the case, many Bangladeshis eagerly await to hear the ruling. The civil lawyers for the accused were not allowed to participate in the court martial and have called the trial a sham. The trial is also being viewed with suspicion from the media in India."
 Shafiullah.4.d:0 "The assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were sentenced to death in court yesterday. The eight men will be hanged in the coming days. Thousands of Awami League supporters took the streets to celebrate this justice for their late leader. The court was not persuaded by the assassins argument that they killed the President to prevent a dictatorship and save the nation. General K.M. Shafiullah, the current President, welcomed the court decision. Three Army majors are among the convicted. Although the government and Awami League welcome the news, there are reports of unrest within the military and among more conservative circles. They believe the accused are being scapegoated and painted in a way to malign the military and other conservative political parties. Many military officers believed the removal of Mujibur Rahman was justified considering his political actions and closeness to India."
 Shafiullah.5.d:0 "The military announced the verdict of its court-martial, all eight involved in assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were sentenced to death. The military added the executions by hanging were already carried out. The news caught many in the country off-guard. A large Awami League rally in honor of the late Mujibur Rahman was hastily organized. Many in the country were critical of the military trial due to its secretive nature, but welcomed the verdict. Within the military, there are some who feel the court made the accused scapegoats. These officers feel the assassination was justified due to the political instability plaguing the nation. The government released a statement welcoming the news and confirming there would be no other trials connected to the assassination. For many Bangladeshis, the incident is resolved, at least for now."
 Shafiullah.6.d:0 "Officers and soldiers who joined the national army from the pre-independence resistance movement known as the Mukti Bahini complain of being isolated in the military. They claim the pre-independence soldiers and officers, all professionally trained, systematically ensure the MB personnel do not receive promotions or attractive postings. The President must decide whether to allow the Army to remain dominated by the professional military class, or insist on a true integration of the forces. Supporting the professional military class would keep the military structure as is, with the MB personnel eventually being retired out of service. Backing the MB personnel will push the military towards a more peoples army organization."
 Shafiullah.7.d:0 "Since taking power, General K.M. Shafiullah has worked tirelessly to identify and neutralize threats to the state. The more militant conservative elements were largely neutralized even before he took power. However, Marxists have long been engaged in violent acts and the hostile infiltration of both the government and military. In response to this threat, General Shafiullah recently ordered a mass crackdown of dangerous Marxist organizations across the nation. Security forces have detained government, military, and public officials identified as pro-Marxist. In addition, a number of student leaders and rural agitators were also detained. In remarks to the nation, General Shafiullah noted socialism is a means towards economic emancipation, however, Marxism represents a threat to the religion and culture of Bangladeshis."
 Shafiullah.8.d:0 "General K.M. Shafiullah, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangladesh, announced new elections will be held in the near future. The respected war hero noted his regime was restoring stability. Across both society and state institutions. The leader did not give a specific date on when elections would be held but stated crime and corruption must be further reduced for an election to be possible. He added that following the election, he would retire from the military, having accomplished his duty to the nation and the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. All political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign openly. The announcement was well-received across Bangladesh. The Awami League appears ready to start its campaigning while the opposition parties are expected to form a coalition to oppose them. Although there is no firm date on elections, the people are satisfied with the present course of the nation."

 ZR_Regime.1.d:0 "General Ziaur Rahman, Chief Martial Law Administrator Bangladesh gave a stirring address to the nation. He noted the people had overcome great adversity in recent years, with many divided along political, religious, and class lines. Zia declared the time had come for healing and stability. He then promised the people a politics of hope, built on looking to the future, not the past. Built not on tearing down or attacking opponents, but on national unity and peaceful development. He promised elections once the situation has stabilized. The comments are being well-received by a beleaguered Bangladeshi population eager for peace and stability."
 ZR_Regime.2.d:0 "The people of Bangladesh took to the polls to elect a new President. The Chief Martial Law Administrator, General Ziaur Rahman won in a landslide. This is a major victory for his new political party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which helped rally popular support during the election campaign. Although General Zia was quick to thank the voters for providing him such a landslide, international observers did note there were irregularities. Despite these reports on the integrity of the vote, many Bangladeshis appear to have welcomed the result. The Awami League released a statement criticizing the voting process."
 ZR_Regime.3.d:0 "Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the assassinated President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has requested permission to return. She and her sister were abroad when rouge military officers butchered their family. The Awami League recognizes Sheikh Hasina as the heir of Mujibur Rahman and previous governments refused her permission to return. For President Zia, her return will provide a major boost to the Awami League. However, to deny her return could spark unrest and cause people to question his own integrity, as he promised the people he would focus on the future, not the past. Permission was ultimately granted, allowing Sheikh Hasina to return home to take on the role her father held for so many years."
 ZR_Regime.4.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman approved a new constitutional amendment adding the Indemnity Act to the constitution. The Indemnity Act had been passed to grant immunity to the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. President Zia insisted his decision is meant to heal the nation and move away from a politics of revenge or grievances. The Awami League and supporters of the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman condemned the amendment. They accuse the President of siding with the assassins and protecting his own political allies who may have been involved behind the scenes. Some publications went so far as to accuse President Zia of passing the amendment to stop any investigation of his own role in the assassination. The President also confirmed the legalization of conservative and religious parties originally banned by the Awami League."
 ZR_Regime.5.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman recognizes the popularity and benefits socialism has had the economy. Certain state industries remain popular in the minds of the people. However, the economy remains weak and a new approach must be tested. The government announced it will freeze any further nationalization, opening several underperforming industries for privatization. In addition, a series of new policies meant to promote private sector growth was initiated. The government hopes shifting towards a more market economy can spur growth and naturally reduce nationalization."
 ZR_Regime.6.d:0 "Historically, twice a year, before harvest, Bangladeshi farmers face the risk of starvation. Food availability during this period is low as are economic opportunities. Many famines and starvations have occurred during this time. President Ziaur Rahman unveiled a new Food for Work Program to end the cycle of starvation. Under the program, Bangladeshi farmers, during these lean periods, will be employed to work on government infrastructure programs in exchange for food. The food provided will save these families and prevent mass starvation. The government believes in addition to providing a public service to the people, the program will strengthen the economy by ensuring agricultural stability all year long."
 ZR_Regime.7.d:0 "There is increased concern, especially among military officers over our reliance on Indian support. The government is under pressure to find an alternative source for military equipment to prevent India from achieving hegemonic influence. China has the equipment, technology, and is geographically close to us. The Foreign Minister is making a trip soon and could request the Chinese provide support for the Bangladesh Army. Others in the cabinet believe shifting to China could lead to an over-correction, giving them too much influence over time, they request we simply use the trip to boost existing ties."
 ZR_Regime.8.d:0 "A high-power delegation from Bangladesh recently requested an expansion of bilateral relations. In particular, they were interested in acquiring tanks. Many Bangladeshi officers, who trained when it was part of Pakistan, are familiar with our technology. This represents an effort from Bangladesh to shy away from India and allow us greater influence in the country. Bangladesh has key ports leading to the Bay of Bengal. Some senior officials do not believe Bangladesh will truly turn from India or offer much in return, they suggest we simply commit to expanding bilateral and trade ties."
 ZR_Regime.9.d:0 "The Chinese government confirmed it will begin the transfer of over two hundred tanks for the Bangladesh Army. The government welcomed the news, along with the media. The Army is elated with the new equipment, believing it provides the nation a strong deterrent to foreign aggression. Domestically, the government is being praised for its statesmanship and ability to negotiate with major powers. The Chinese are expected to expand their diplomatic presence in the country to facilitate the new agreement."
 ZR_Regime.10.d:0 "Upon independence, Bangladesh embraced a secular ideology. Unfortunately, many Muslim states wrongly interpreted this as a suppression of Islamic identity, when this was far from the truth. Bangladesh has always remained a devout nation. President Ziaur Rahman has publicly returned Islamic greetings and invocations in public events, indicating that though the government remains secular, it will not hide the Islamic identity of the people. With our religious credentials secured, we can now approach Saudi Arabia to normalize talks and find opportunities for our people in the rich Kingdom."
 ZR_Regime.11.d:0 "The government of Bangladesh privately approached us, asking to hold talks. They seek to normalize ties with our people. Our close relations with Pakistan and their initial embrace of secularism at the expense of Islamic identity previously held relations back. Pakistan no longer appears too concerned over foreign relations with Bangladesh. The current government in Bangladesh has also emphasized the Islamic identity of its people. Holding talks and normalizing ties would go a long way in supporting this pro-Islam government."
 ZR_Regime.12.d:0 "Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh signed a series of agreements, strengthening bilateral ties, expanding diplomatic missions, and agreeing to regular inter-ministerial meetings. Bangladeshis are said to be happy with the agreement, as the number of Hajj pilgrims were also raised. The recent engagement with Saudi Arabia represents a wider effort by the government to more directly engage with Muslim nations over socialist."
 ZR_Regime.13.d:0 "Since the normalization of ties, our diplomatic staff and other visitors were struck by the large numbers of professionally trained Bangladeshis. In addition, there are millions on the street, willing to work, but unable to due to the weak economy. We had signed some contracts with Bangladeshi workers to come and work in Saudi Arabia. We offer them high wages and other benefits, as long as they do not break social customs and agree to remain guest workers, not residents or citizens. The Bangladesh government recently proposed we more formalize the guest worker program to facilitate a larger number of workers and maximize the remittance they send back. This will transform our desperate for labor economy."
 ZR_Regime.14.d:0 "After several discussions, the framework for a Guest Worker Agreement was laid out. Saudi Arabia will be able to recruit all the non-skilled and professional labor it wishes from our country. We have a surplus in labor and Saudi Arabia presents immense opportunities for the people. Guest worker agents, companies, and advertisement will be freely allowed. In exchange, our workers will enjoy high standards of living, compared to home, and the ability to easily remit their earnings back home to families. We expect both nations will benefit greatly in the years to come."
 ZR_Regime.15.d:0 "Several years after the agreement on guest workers with Saudi Arabia, the impact is already being felt. Many, previously impoverished or struggling middle class families, are now acquiring new homes, high quality education for children, and consumer goods. The influx of remittance from Saudi Arabia is leading this boom. Our normally struggling economy is well-served by the large guest worker program, as the cash being sent from Saudi Arabia is supporting all major sectors of the economy. The government is being widely praised for its initiative on this program, with these new guest worker families being dubbed the fastest growing middle class in Bangladesh."
 ZR_Regime.16.d:0 "As part of the flourishing ties with Saudi Arabia, the Bangladeshi government gave it permission to fund a new madrassah in the country. The new, large school, fully funded by the Saudis, will provide Islamic education to boys across Bangladesh. The Saudi Ambassador praised the new school, calling it the first of many that will help strengthen the Islamic bonds which hold the Muslim world together. Many Bangladeshis welcome the new schools as they provide free tuition, boarding, and food. Making them ideal for the more impoverished families. The President of Bangladesh released his own statement praising the new school."
 ZR_Regime.17.d:0 "Since the separation from Pakistan, relations have cooled. However, many in the country still feel an ideological and religious connection to Pakistan. We are the two Islamic states in the subcontinent. There are several senior advisors who believe reaching out to Pakistan can re-establish historical links and give us a potential avenue in case ties with India sour. We can ask an intermediary state to approach the Pakistanis about holding talks. There are a large number of Bangladeshis who do hold negative views of Pakistan, so the decision to engage must be carefully considered."
 ZR_Regime.18.d:0 "An ambassador from an intermediary state sent us a message that Bangladesh wishes to hold talks. Although the separation left bitter memories, many in Pakistan still desire our nation to enjoy brotherly ties with all Muslim states. There are still many senior Bangladeshis, especially in the military who were trained in Pakistani schools. We can offer to host talks to improve bilateral and potentially trade ties. Or we can focus on improving bilateral ties while offering military training, to re-establish the defence links between our nations. The cabinet must decide which approach it wishes to offer the Bangladeshis before the talks can take place."
 ZR_Regime.19.d:0 "The Pakistan government have proven receptive to our efforts at improving times. Many in Pakistan believe despite the difficult past, the Muslim states must stick together in South Asia. There are indications the Pakistanis would be willing to not only improve diplomatic contacts, but also strengthen trade ties. We can decide the extent of improving bilateral ties. Regardless of our decision, we can expect a reaction from New Delhi. The people of Bangladesh look forward to normalization with a nation so many of our people struggled to found."
 ZR_Regime.20.d:0 "The Pakistan government have proven receptive to our efforts at improving times. Many in Pakistan believe despite the difficult past, the Muslim states must stick together in South Asia. There are indications the Pakistanis would be willing to not only improve diplomatic contacts, but also provide military training. Many of our officers were trained by the Pakistan Army and maintaining such contacts could prove beneficial as we build our own military capabilities. However, we would have to keep the military links private as many Bangladeshis may not react positively to such news. We could also chose to just focus on improving bilateral ties."
 ZR_Regime.21.d:0 "The Indian ambassador delivered a message from New Delhi expressing displeasure at our recent talks with Pakistan. The Indian government is not happy at the increased bilateral ties. We informed the Indians our relationships are our own affairs. Regardless, the Indians cancelled some of our cultural exchange programs and added some restrictions to trade. This is unfortunate, but we cannot accept a situation where India dictates the foreign policy of Bangladesh. The media is reporting on this spat, but the public largely supports our stance."

 JAF_472.1.d:0 "The Japanese Red Army (JRA) successfully hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 from Bombay. Five armed hijackers took control of the airplane and directed the pilot to Dacca. The hijackers are now sitting in the plane, on the tarmac, holding the 156 passengers and crew hostage. The JRA is demanding six million dollars and the release of nine imprisoned JRA members. The Japanese government is holding an emergency meeting to discuss a response. The Bangladeshi government has surrounded the plane but will await the Japanese response. President Ziaur Rahman is holding talks with his top security officials." 
 JAF_472.2.d:0 "There are reports of unrest at the Bogra Cantonment. The recent Japanese Airline hostage crisis in Dacca has led to rumors and unrest among anti-government military personnel who believe a wider coup is occurring. Armed troops were seen taking control of local government buildings and there are reports senior officers in the cantonment are under arrest. A column of loyal troops were sent to Bogra. After a tense standoff, the rebellion was quelled. However, the quelling of Bogra has not ended the rumors and there are reports of similar revolts in other garrisons. The government must brace itself for further incidents."
 JAF_472.3.d:0 "An assault on the residence of President Ziaur Rahman was thwarted. Anti-government members of the Air Force with Army sympathizers launched a revolt, believing they were supporting a national coup against the President. The rebel troops temporarily seized Dacca Radio and at the international airport, at least two dozen Air Force personnel, including officers were killed. These officers were negotiating with the Japanese Red Army terrorists currently holding a Japan Airlines flight hostage on the runway. Thankfully, local Air Force and Army sector commanders were able to put down the revolt, detaining many of the rebels. The government has directed the military to immediately detain any dissident personnel."
 JAF_472.4.d:0 "A Japan Airlines flight from Bombay was recently hijacked by armed Japan Red Army members. The plane is currently in Dacca, the hijackers are demanding six million dollars and the release of nine of their members from prison. The public is adamant we get the 156 hostages returned safely. Our international partners are urging us to refuse the demands, saying it will set a bad precedent not just for the global community but for Japan. However, the sentiment of our people and most officials is that saving human life, no matter the cost, must be the guiding ideal. A decision must be made."
 JAF_472.5.d:0 "The government agreed to the Japan Red Army hijackers demands. A Japan Airlines flight is being chartered to Dacca with the six million dollars for the hostage takers. The plane will also bring home the 156 hostages. We also released the prisoners, as instructed. Although many internationally are condemning the decision as appeasing terrorism, the Prime Minister released a statement, noting the life of a single person outweighs the earth. This sentiment resonates with the Japanese people who welcome the news. With the situation resolved, the government also announced plans to establish a robust anti-terrorism force to handle future crisis like this."
 JAF_472.6.d:0 "The Japanese government refused the demands of the Japan Red Army hijackers currently holding a plane of 156 hostages on the tarmac in Dacca. This is a major escalation, and there are fears the hijackers may act rashly. Upon hearing the news, the hijackers demanded the Bangladesh government refuel the plane and allow it to leave. President Ziaur Rahman is faced with a difficult choice, he can acquiesce to the demand, allowing the crisis to leave Bangladesh, or send in troops to storm the jet. Storming the jet will be incredibly risky, but show terrorists that Bangladesh is not a location from which to issue demands or conduct operations."
 JAF_472.7.d:0 "The Japan Airlines flight 472 hijacking continues after the Bangladesh government fueled the plane and allowed it to leave the country. The plane is headed towards the middle east, though a final destination has not been given. Five armed members of the Japan Red Army took the plane hostage from Bombay, landing it in Dacca. They demanded the release of several members in Japan along with six million dollars. The Japanese government refused the demands. To avoid a violent escalation, the Bangladeshi government complied with the terrorist demand that the plane be fueled and allowed to leave with its hostages. President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh expressed his wish that the crisis be resolved without the loss of innocent lives."
 JAF_472.8.d:0 "In a stunning night time assault, Bangladeshi commandos stormed Japanese Airlines flight 472. The flight was recently hijacked by armed members of the Japan Red Army after it took off from Bombay. The plane was taken to Dacca where the hijackers demanded millions of dollars and the release of its members from Japanese prisons. After the Japanese government refused its demands, the Bangladeshi government decided to act to prevent the killing of hostages. The operation to storm the plane lasted only minutes, but resulted in reports heavy gunfire exchanges and explosions. The Bangladesh Army confirmed the plane was secured, with the terrorists neutralized. When asked about the condition of the hostages, the military admitted there were a number of casualties but most were rescued safely."
 JAF_472.9.d:0 "The recent Japan Airlines crisis led to rumors across Bangladesh, resulting in armed rebellions by anti-government military personnel. These men thought the government had collapsed or a wider coup was in motion, resulting in major uprisings across bases. These rebellions were quickly squashed with many of the ringleaders taken into custody. President Ziaur Rahman has received two lists, one of all the military personnel involved in the unrest. The other list includes suspected police, intelligence, and other security personnel believed to have facilitated the uprisings. He must decide whether to purge just the military, or his entire security apparatus of his enemies."
 JAF_472.10.d:0 "The Japanese Airline hostage crisis has caused wild rumors to spread in military bases across the country. An earlier anti-government mutiny in Bogra was successfully quelled, but the uprising there inspired pro-JSD soldiers in Dacca to launch their own coup. The rebellious soldiers, with support from local JSD fighters not only seized control of the cantonment but also captured President Ziaur Rahman. Many senior Bangladeshi military officers, who were with the President to discuss the hostage crisis, were also captured. Pro-JSD elements are now taking control of military bases across the country, with loyalist forces paralyzed from action due to the lack of leadership."
 JAF_472.11.d:0 "The JSD announced the formation of a new government. Pro-JSD military personnel recently launched a coup, driven by rumors related to the ongoing Japanese Airline hostage crisis. The President along with senior military officials was captured by the rebel soldiers, inspiring JSD fighters and their supporters to seize control of the country. The JSD claims it will bring socialism to the people, end corruption, and bring take the Bangladeshi people to their true destiny. The people of Bangladesh are said to be stunned by this sudden reversal on the ground. In terms of the hostage crisis, the JSD said it will continue efforts to resolve the situation with the Japanese government."

 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.1.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman received reports that his local party officials in Chittagong are suffering from intense political infighting. The situation is deteriorating rapidly, and his presence is requested to negotiate a compromise. Moving quickly, the President has left Dacca. He plans on staying near the Army cantonment for the next few days to resolve the matter. Maintaining party discipline and unity in Chittagong is crucial for the governing of the country. Before leaving the capital, the President assured his top officials that the matter will be resolved in a matter of days."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.2.d:0 "President Ziaur Rahman is dead. A group of commissioned officers, armed with submachine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades stormed the Circuit Hotel where the President was staying while on a visit to Chittagong. The assassins avoided dealing with a frontal assault, blowing up two holes in the rear of the Circuit Hotel. Before the main force of Presidential Guards could arrive, the assassins had managed to capture Ziaur Rahman before executing him at close range. Two of the assassins were killed as they escaped, one identified as a colonel. General Abul Manzoor, the Chittagong commander, took to the local radio, calling on the nation to unite and create a real nation. It appears a coup is afoot."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.3.d:0 "Fears of a coup in Bangladesh over the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman have dissipated. The serving Army Chief, General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, quickly took charge of the situation. He went on the radio and called on all rebel forces to surrender and the arrest of General Abul Manzoor. The response has effectively isolated Chittagong and the rebel leaders from the rest of the nation. The swift response by General Ershad has rallied all other major garrisons to pledge their loyalty to the government and Army hierarchy. There are reports of unrest among the troops in Chittagong over both the assassination and radio broadcasts."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.4.d:0 "General Abul Manzur, viewed as the mastermind behind the assassination of the late President Ziaur Rahman, was reported to have been killed, effectively ending his rebellion. Following demands by the Army Chief for Manzur and his forces to surrender, half the Chittagong garrison switched their loyalty back to the government. With the situation turned against him, General Manzur reportedly surrendered to loyalist troops without incident. However, within several hours, he was reported to be killed. Rumors are circulating that an angry group of loyalist soldiers surrounded and killed the rebel commander out of anger. Although many in the country feel justice was done, there are some rumors suggesting Manzur was killed to silence him from revealing the involvement of more senior military and civilian leaders to the coup attempt."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.5.d:0 "A couple million Bangladeshis attended the funeral of the late President Ziaur Rahman in Dacca. The crowd was grief stricken, with many expressing great sorrow for the late leader. Despite his reputation as a strong-man, many felt President Rahman brought a firm hand the nation needed. His campaigns for promoting nationalism and economic stability will be a lasting memory. As the funeral ends, many in the country will be looking nervously to the future. Vice President Abdus Sattar was sworn in to assume the presidency. The seasoned elder statesman promised to continue the policies of Ziaur Rahman and hold fresh elections in the near future."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.6.d:0 "Acting President Abdus Sattar, who took over following the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, easily won the recent presidential election. Many Bangladeshis view the election results as confirmation the country remains committed to the legacy of Ziaur Rahman. President Sattar thanked the supporters of the BNP and called for a new era of development for the nation. He also revealed a vision for increasing the cooperation of national institutions. Despite the victory, there are concerns over the health and age of Sattar."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.7.d:0 "General Hussain Muhammad Ershad has assumed the post of President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. Over the previous hours, the President and Vice President both resigned. General Ershad dissolved the parliament and announced hundreds of politicians will be arrested for corruption. The military claims it had to act following the inefficiencies of the current government. General Ershad insists that if he had not acted, anti-state forces would have plunged Bangladesh into chaos. Analysts are not surprised by the coup as the President and Army Chief had been engaged in political bickering over the past few months. A recent decision to remove military officers from administrative posts is seen as the last draw. Bangladeshis look towards an uncertain future."
 Ziaur_Rahman_Assasination.8.d:0 "Bangladeshi strongman and President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in an apparent coup attempt in Chittagong. Reports say the President was lured there by a local military commander who then orchestrated an assault on his residence. The Army Chief, General Hussein Mohammad Ershad, reacted quickly, demanding the rebel soldiers immediately surrender and dispatching troops to pacify the city. The rebels quickly surrendered and the military leader who led the revolt was allegedly killed by soldiers angry over the assassination. President Rahman will be laid to rest in Dacca, where at least a million mourners are expected to pay their respects. The military ruler proved to be popular by establishing a stable regime in a nation plagued by political instability. Per the constitution, Abdus Sattar is the acting president, and he has promised fresh elections in the coming months."

 FG_AL.0.d:0 "There is a sense of great excitement across Bangladesh as the people take to the polls. Many Bangladeshis view the elections as confirmation of their nation as the true vanguard of South Asian democracy. The Awami League is expected to triumph in the polls. With the results an almost foregone conclusion, the Awami League leadership faces a dilemma. It can rule independently, to fully implement its vision for the country. However, there are some within the party who advocate the formation of a national unity government, to bring all Bangladeshis in the political process. The Central Committee must make a decision on how to proceed."
 FG_AL.1.d:0 "In the late 1950s, two organizations formed to teach and spread awareness on Islamic practices in Dacca. In the years following, these organizations became the leading research institutions in the region on Islamic philosophy, culture, and knowledge. The government recently cracked down and banned the organizations for not supporting efforts at promoting Bangladesh independence. However, the people of Bangladesh increasingly want the organizations reinstated for spiritual guidance, leading to large protests. There is a proposal in parliament to merge the former groups into a government funded organization called the Islamic Foundation. The new organization would focus exclusively on spiritual matters and not intervene in politics. Some secularists argue such an organization goes against basic democratic principles and the government should maintain a ban."
 FG_AL.2.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is currently governing the country based on the recent constitution, however, the government faces accusations of ignoring its provisions. There are efforts underway to pass new amendments that will legitimize some of the questionable actions by the government. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wishes for the document to refocus on the core principles of nationalism, secularism, democracy, and socialism. Despite these lofty claims of expanding constitutional authority, the opposition accuses the government of creating a one-party state. Members of the ruling Awami League urge patience, noting the widespread problems currently facing the country."
 FG_AL.3.d:0 "The Bangladeshi peasant remains a victim of history, first by the pre-colonial feudal aristocracy and then by the colonial regime that empowered these zamindars. As such, much of the land remains underdeveloped or under the control of a small cabal. Socialism offers a path for the prosperity of the peasant. The cabinet has presented two programs of land reform, one calls for a moderate program of collectivization, while the other calls for a radical change. Some urge rapid action to transform society, but those supporting a moderate program note it may be better to ease society into socialism."
 FG_AL.4.d:0 "The collectivization project we recently launched has hit major hurdles. Many peasants are refusing to give up their small holdings. More significantly, landlords are maintaining control by paying peasants to hold lands for them, defeating the purpose of the program. The civil service appears incapable of effectively identifying new lands to cultivate nor are government agents able to boost local production. We will have to scale back the collectivization program. On top of that, many peasants are infuriated with the government, the program has proven to be disastrous and agricultural production has dropped dramatically."
 FG_AL.5.d:0 "Issues with the bureaucracy, weak rural authority, and problems with collectivization have caused severe food shortages. The current year shows a precipitous drop in agricultural productivity. There are already reports of starvation among peasant communities, with many fleeing to the cities. The cost of food is rising as well, fueling panic in the urban populations. Our own officials failed to keep the central government abreast with these issues and many ministries are struggling to respond. There are promises of international aid and support, but this will not come fast enough or in the quantities needed for our people. In a recent report to the cabinet, the Agricultural Minister noted the nation had entered a famine situation."
 FG_AL.6.d:0 "The famine gripping Bangladesh is causing mass death but also hysteria on the streets. Politicians, landlords, and even the military are being accused of hoarding food stores from the general population. Peasants arriving to the city are desperate, police agencies report of violent protests and a rise in crime. The President has only one option. He must declare a humanitarian state of emergency to mobilize state resources and crackdown on hoarding by organized criminal elements. Once we stabilize the economy, the increasingly lawlessness and political disorder will also be addressed. Many in the Awami League recognize the opposition has recklessly sought to spread dangerous rumors for political gains."
 FG_AL.7.d:0 "Bangladesh faces unprecedented challenges. The government continues to be attacked by the opposition, which does not hesitate to publish false news to enflame the population. If we are to implement our vision for the nation, some in the party suggest a radical solution. They want to push through a constitution amendment banning all political parties for national unity. The President can then declare a state of emergency and create a one-party state. We can then bring all political leaders under the President and carry out our agenda completely. However, this step maybe too radical, a decision must be made."
 FG_AL.8.d:0 "The Parliament of Bangladesh narrowly passed a new amendment allowing the President to ban any political party during a state of emergency. Despite vehement protests from the opposition, who claim the new law is ripe for abuse, it was passed. The President states the bill will ensure an emergency situation can be handled efficiently. The reaction from the media has been mixed. Pro-government publications note the heightened political climate means such laws must be passed. The opposition press is arguing the bill lays the groundwork for a political takeover by the government."
 FG_AL.9.d:0 "In light of the increasingly unstable political environment, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a state of emergency. Per his emergency powers, the President declared all political parties are to be banned. He stated his intentions to provide a meaningful solution to the political infighting in the country. The opposition leaders could not be reached for comment, most are under police protection. Although Mujibur Rahman promised to restore normalcy, many in the country are unsure what normalcy will mean."
 FG_AL.10.d:0 "President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a new political party called the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League or BaKSAL. All politicians are required to join, including all sitting members of parliament. A new cabinet, consisting of members from all major political parties will govern the nation. Mujibur Rahman calls the new party as essential to establishing political harmony and unity. With the political leadership united, Bangladesh can finally embrace its destiny. Due to press censorships, it is unclear how the public is reacting. However, the foreign press notes a general, uneasy quietness among the people, indicating some discontent may be present."

 FG_UNITY.1.d:0 "The Islamic parties in Bangladesh, many with powerful grassroots organizations, are demanding the establishment of a ministry for Islamic affairs. They would like all legislation to be reviewed by this ministry to determine if it is compatible with Islam. This is of course unacceptable, Islam should be above politics. Instead, a compromise has been reached to establish an Islamic Academy to promote Islam and provide non-binding advice to the government when asked. However, even this is seen as unacceptable, especially to the more left wing elements of the Awami League. They advocate complete secularism."
 FG_UNITY.2.d:0 "A group of leftist Awami League leaders, along with members of other left-wing parties have brought a demand on the government to greatly empower collective bargaining rights for workers. This is causing a stir as the Finance Ministry reports the decision may prove economically unwise, considering the current economic climate. Business leaders have also urged the government to not cave to such demands. However, it is clear from union leaders that a failure to implement the demand may provoke worker unrest. The government faces a difficult decision."
 FG_UNITY.3.d:0 "The recent decision by the government to implement wider worker rights has borne some unexpected boosts. Reports indicate greater production and fewer incidents of worker unrest, which had been escalating in recent months. The government must take advantage of the stability in production and labor relations."
 FG_UNITY.4.d:0 "The Awami League and its allies have long advocated a radical transformation of agriculture. They believe the colonial and post-colonial state maintained archaic modes of agriculture that hindered the development of peasants. For them, collectivization offers a solution to the crisis. The Awami League has proposed a modest collectivization program to not completely alienate the other parties in the coalition. The more conservative parties, however, believe such a step is too radical. They instead wish to institute a land reform which will allow the state to seize unproductive lands for redistribution to peasants. If collectivization is pushed through, the unity government maybe at risk."
 FG_UNITY.5.d:0 "The government recently launched a program to acquire arable land not being utilized from big landlords and redistributing it to peasants. The program enjoyed early success, however, it has begun to stall. The landlords are bribing local officials with impunity to ensure the land remains under their control through proxies. The government in Dacca appears uninterested or unable to stop these practices, undermining the whole program."
 FG_UNITY.6.d:0 "The failed land reform program has resulted in pushing Bangladesh into a famine. The unreliability of data has resulted in a much larger shortfall of agricultural objectives. The government appears unable to bring enough food from abroad to mitigate the situation. The increased scarcity of food is already leading to prices to go up in the markets. Many farmers are being accused of hording food, as are government officials. The situation is rapidly falling apart, the government will have to deal with this soon."
 FG_UNITY.7.d:0 "Nationalization is a divisive issue in the parliament. The Awami League remains committed to widespread nationalization, however, many of the other parties urge a more gradual nationalization program. There is also widespread support for a more mixed economy of both private and nationalized industry. The government proposes an Industrial Nationalization Program based in Chittagong. However, the more conservative unity government members would prefer a more modest program to nationalize some essential industries. If the Industrial Nationalization Program goes through, there are worries the unity government may collapse."
 FG_UNITY.8.d:0 "The question of settling refugees remains very pressing for the government. There are refugees who came during Partition and recently from Pakistan. Having them in camps is not a long-term solution, it erodes popular support for the government. One plan calls for these refugees to be placed in communities desperate for labor to produce new development projects. The other proposal is to settle refugees in commercial neighborhoods, especially markets to support that part of the economy."
 FG_UNITY.9.d:0 "Many young leftists are increasingly critical of the government. They feel socialism is being neglected in the name of political compromises and the current party leadership is out of touch. Many want some of the more senior members to resign and give space to youth leaders. There are increasingly violent protests erupting in Dacca, with students demanding an end to the unity government and implement complete socialism to the country. The Awami League can appeal this group by promoting some of more left-wing leaders to senior positions within the party, though this would put a strain on the unity government, perhaps breaking it. The other option is to deploy the police to crackdown on these protests and try to force party discipline on the campuses."
 FG_UNITY.10.d:0 "The Awami League led unity government has collapsed. The coalition partners claim the Awami League is not governing by consensus. The move comes after a series of disagreements with regards to recent legislation. Coalition partners claim the Awami League is seeking to push through radical legislation. Although the unity government has collapsed, the Awami League will continue to govern as it holds the majority of seats. The government released a statement, noting it had formed the unity government out for the sake of national unity but the opposition now wishes to play politics as Bangladesh faces a critical juncture."
 FG_UNITY.11.d:0 "Foreign policy is of critical concern for the government. Those with a strong attachment to the colonial period and the early Pakistan movement support, a push to strengthening ties with the West. They see Bangladeshi democracy and economy being intrinsically linked with those ties. The socialist and left leaning people wish to focus on improving ties with the socialist world. They believe the future of Bangladesh lies in creating a socialist society. Finally, there are many who feel much of the problems facing Bangladesh comes from foreign influence, they wish to focus on ties with neighbors and regional powers."
 FG_UNITY.12.d:0 "The famine gripping Bangladesh is causing mass death but also hysteria on the streets. Politicians, landlords, and even the military are being accused of hoarding food stores from the general population. Peasants arriving to the city are desperate, police agencies report of violent protests and a rise in crime. The President has only one option. He must declare a humanitarian state of emergency to mobilize state resources and crackdown on hoarding by organized criminal elements. Once we stabilize the economy, the increasingly lawlessness and political disorder will also be addressed. Many in the Awami League recognize the opposition has recklessly sought to spread dangerous rumors for political gains, despite efforts by the party to govern in unity."
 FG_UNITY.13.d:0 "The nation faces unprecedented challenges, socially, politically, and economically. The current famine has revealed the limitations of the unity government. If we are to bring the Awami League vision for the nation, some in the party suggest a radical solution. They want to push through a constitution amendment banning all political parties to promote true national unity. The President can then declare a state of emergency and create a one-party state. We can then bring all political leaders under the President and carry out our agenda completely. However, this step maybe too radical, a decision must be made."
 FG_UNITY.14.d:0 "The President met with the Finance Minister and other key economic advisors to determine the details of a new industrialization scheme for Chittagong. Due to the current financial constraints, only a limited project is possible. The government can focus on building the infrastructural base, setting up future growth by strengthening transportation and power production in the area. Or it can focus on establishing new factories to expand production as soon as possible. The project is estimated to take three years to complete."
 FG_UNITY.15.d:0 "The President held a press conference confirming the Industrial Nationalization Program completed its work in Chittagong. He lauded the establishment of multiple state-run power stations and the urban infrastructure of the city. The base is set for sustained, rapid industrial growth, which will provide opportunities, development, and prosperity for the region. The program is being lauded by the media as a model for other regions in the country. An Awami League parliamentarian spokesman gave a separate statement praising the cooperation of state institutions in economic development."
 FG_UNITY.16.d:0 "The President held a press conference confirming the Industrial Nationalization Program completed its work in Chittagong.

The region appears set for sustained, rapid economic growth, which will provide opportunities, development, and prosperity for the region. The program is being lauded by the media as a model for other regions in the country. An Awami League parliamentarian spokesman gave a separate statement praising the cooperation of state institutions in economic development."

 BAN_JSD.1.d:0 "The new Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) regime announced a major transformation for the military. The party announced all reactionary elements and disloyal components are to be removed. There are reports of mass arrests, especially of career soldiers and officers. Military preparatory schools are also being raided, with plans announced to change the curriculum. Some senior Bangladeshi officers have fled the country, many ending up in India. When a government spokesman was asked about the fate of arrested personnel, he stated they would be tried by military tribunals."
 BAN_JSD.2.d:0 "The new Bangladeshi government promises to bring true socialism to their people. Its radical agenda has isolated it from neighbors and other powers. A diplomatic representative from Bangladesh recently approached us asking for a comprehensive agreement on economic and military aid. Bangladesh wishes to jumpstart its transition to a socialist economy and develop a capable military to defend its revolution. Our experts indicate the new regime has made dramatic efforts to purge counterrevolutionaries, especially in its military. Without comprehensive support, they may struggle to hold power. Supporting the regime may give us a socialist ally in the region, but some advisors believe the new regime is too unstable and we should not support a potentially self-destructive regime."
 BAN_JSD.3.d:0 "We recently concluded a major economic aid package from the Soviet Union. This is a major boon for the revolution and provides much greater legitimacy to our regime. The economy of Bangladesh was long the victim of exploitation by colonizers and occupiers. We must build an economy meant for the growth of the people, not outside interests. The Soviet aid and advisors will play a valuable role in helping the revolution succeed. As part of the agreement, we can expect regular visits from Soviet officials to oversee operations."
 BAN_JSD.4.d:0 "We successfully concluded major economic and military aid packages with the Soviet Union. This will go a long way to solidify the revolution and legitimize our regime within the socialist world. Our economy has long been the victim of exploitation by both colonizers and occupiers. The Soviet support will help turn Bangladesh into an industrial paradise for the workers. The revolution has many enemies, both internally and in the region. A weak military means an unprotected revolution. The Soviets plan to provide advanced training and weapons for our fledging military. Our senior officers will no longer be products of imperialist finishing schools."
 BAN_JSD.5.d:0 "After privately approaching the Soviet Union for talks, we were quietly denied. It appears our revolution has enemies internally, abroad, and within the socialist camp. The Soviets did not give a clear reason, simply stating it needed to assess the situation completely. It did agree to maintain its embassy in the country. It is clear now that outside powers are seeking to strangle our revolution in the cradle, we must come together as a nation to finally free our people from the shackles of imperialism and capitalism."
 BAN_JSD.6.d:0 "The Indian communist movement is vast and includes ideologues of all different positions. Some of the more radical ones have increasingly found their voice ignored by the wider movement, which appears devoted to operating within the capitalistic and feudalistic order within India. Some of the more radical leaders are also the target of government repression. Over the last few weeks, a number of these more radical communist leaders have arrived in Dacca. As a revolutionary regime, we welcome these activists, who are making public addresses, both at public meetings and on the radio. They are also publishing important articles and journals about their cause. The Indian ambassador constantly asks for us to deport these activists or curtail their activities, but we will never betray revolutionaries."
 BAN_JSD.7.d:0 "Proletariat Committees are being established across the nation. Local workers are electing local representatives to govern their area. These committees also present the views and grievances of their community to regional party structures. This is representation at its most basic level, giving a voice to all Bangladeshis."
 BAN_JSD.8.d:0 "After weeks of discussions, the Central Economic Planning Committee is prepared to decide what route the economy should take in for the next ten years. One faction believes Bangladesh must lay the foundation for future growth, they wish to focus on developing infrastructure. Another faction believes in agriculture, they wish to develop that sector, along with expanding banks and port facilities to eventually export our agricultural wealth. Finally, the industrialist faction believes building a powerful industrial base will fuel rapid economic growth. A decision must be made."\
 BAN_JSD.9.d:0 "The previous regime had initiated a nationalization plan, but it was only half-heartedly executed. We plan on incorporating most of these plans to our own effort. However, our senior economic advisors believe with a little focus, we can rapidly complete a project and yield immediate results. We must decide which project to complete. We can finish a collectivization project, an industrial project, or a rural financial independence project. Only our regime has the capacity to turn a failed effort by the last government into a success for the people."

 Bangladesh_Federation.1.d:0 "Following the establishment of a Co-Federation, a Constituent Assembly has established to create a constitution for East Pakistan. The leading political and social leaders of East Pakistan are meeting under the chairmanship of the highly respected, Justice of the Dacca Higher Court, Abdus Sattar. In an unprecedented move, the discussions of the assembly are to remain private and unpublicized. This is to prevent undue influence either by the federal government or local political parties. Once the constitution is completed, general elections will be held in three months. (The decisions made by the player throughout this tree will determine which type of constitution will be established.)"
 Bangladesh_Federation.2.d:0 "One of the early debates is regarding the status of human rights in the province. Some wish to create a Bill of Rights similar to those established by the British and American constitutions. Supporters of this approach see it as keeping with international norms for all civilized societies. However, another group in the assembly claim Islam inherently guarantees all human rights. They wish for a statement espousing the universal principles of human rights in accordance to Islamic traditions. After a fierce debate, a decision must be made."
 Bangladesh_Federation.3.d:0 "A glaring issue early on is the role of secularism in the constitution. Many members of the assembly were educated in secular institutions or work in secular professions. However, Islam is the major religion of many East Pakistanis and a number of religious leaders were selected by the people to represent them at the assembly. These members argue Islam is inherently the most just religion and the constitution should begin with a statement proclaiming adherence to the principles of Islam. However, the liberal members find this potentially problematic and would like to keep the document secular, in order to protect the interests of all East Pakistani citizens."
 Bangladesh_Federation.4.d:0 "East Pakistan is home to a diverse population, including minority caste and underrepresented communities. Pakistan was founded due to the refusal of the Congress Party to preserve the political rights of minority communities, it is natural the East Pakistan constitution will continue the policy of preserving minority seats. The more traditional elements wish for generous reserved seats, especially for women and the Hindu communities. However, the liberal elements point out the proposal would potentially limit the electoral potential of these communities. They wish to offer a more limited reserved seat proportion to give more direct democracy opportunities for minority communities."
 Bangladesh_Federation.5.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly is debating the extent of parliamentary power. Many members believe most executive power should be held by the Prime Minister. An empowered Prime Minister would be able to directly guide the legislature. More importantly, a Prime Minister must be a member of parliament, requiring the executive to be elected by the people. However, there are other members who believe an empowered chief executive should hold most executive authority. Supporters for a stronger chief executive believe this would support a balance of power between the branches of government. More importantly, such a chief executive would not be corrupted by the politics within the parliament."
 Bangladesh_Federation.6.d:0 "East Pakistan has a rich judicial history. The earliest colonial courts were founded in Bengal. Many of the most celebrated East Pakistani leaders come from a legal background. The question is whether the legislature should look to the Pakistan Supreme Court or to an East Pakistan Supreme Court that will be established with the constitution for the constitutionality of legislation. Those who support more connections with West Pakistan support looking towards the Pakistan Supreme Court. However, those wishing for greater autonomy want the East Pakistan Supreme Court, knowing that in the future this will likely lead to a major judicial headache in the future."
 Bangladesh_Federation.7.d:0 "The East Pakistan Constituent Assembly presented a constitution that strongly favors the federation model with West Pakistan. Many note how the document follows the Pakistan constitution on a number of issues and themes. Members who drafted the constitution praise it as guaranteeing the unity of Pakistan while providing dignity to East Pakistanis. There have been sporadic protests, particularly by Bengali nationalists who condemn the document as one drafted by elites to suppress the voice of the masses. Elections will be held in three months, with the winning parties set to determine the final relationship with Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_Federation.8.d:0 "The East Pakistan Constituent Assembly presented a constitution that strongly favors greater autonomy within Pakistan. Leading political, military, and government officials are said to be concerned with the document. West Pakistani newspapers blasted it for at times completely contradicting the spirit of the Pakistan constitution. In East Pakistan, there were some rallies by Bengali nationalists favoring the document. However, the constitution is not being universally praised, as many middle class and conservative East Pakistanis have expressed concerns over a constitution, they feel is deliberately confrontational. Elections will be held in three months, with the winning parties set to determine the final relationship with Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_Federation.9.d:0 "To the surprise of few, the pro-federation parties dominated the East Pakistan general elections. A coalition of these parties will soon form to govern and establish a firm, new relationship between the wings of Pakistan. The elections were held in an almost festive atmosphere, though there were accusations of voter manipulation by some pro-autonomy groups. They claimed the new constitution offered generous voting rights, allowing many West Pakistanis, who only lived briefly in the province or served there for government or military purposes full voting rights. Despite these accusations, it appears the elections are generally being accepted."
 Bangladesh_Federation.10.d:0 "To the surprise of few, the pro-autonomy parties dominated the East Pakistan general elections. A coalition of these parties, led by the Awami League, will soon form to govern, and establish a firm, new relationship between the wings of Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is expected to head the government. The elections were held in an almost festive atmosphere, though there were accusations of voter manipulation by some pro-federation groups. They claim the new constitution made residency requirements so strict that many West Pakistanis, who have commercial or family interests in East Pakistan, were unable to participate. Regardless, it appears the elections are generally being accepted."
 Bangladesh_Federation.11.d:0 "With the announcement of a federation between West and East Pakistan, the senior bureaucratic and administrative officials from both wings, along with federal officials, have met to discuss the partitioning of assets. The two sides recently concluding an agreement on not only splitting assets but also laying out the responsibilities of federal and provincial agencies. The agreement is largely being well-received, though some pro-autonomy East Pakistani media outlets are complaining East Pakistan remains largely subordinate to the center. A spokesman for the President lauded the successful talks, claiming it is just one small step to building a stronger Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_Federation.12.d:0 "After difficult talks, the Pakistan military confirmed it had agreed to allow its personnel to decide whether to serve in the West Pakistan military or the fledgling East Pakistan military. It is expected that virtually all East Pakistani personnel will opt for East Pakistan, although there is an indication that some West Pakistanis with marital ties to the eastern wing may also join. The details remain sketchy, but it appears West Pakistan will transfer at least two infantry divisions worth of equipment. There is also expected to be a transfer of fighter planes for the eastern wing. The President praised the military for its ability to support the Pakistan Federation. Privately, there is said to be annoyance among West Pakistani military officers, but they are expected to follow through on the agreement."
 Bangladesh_Federation.13.d:0 "The federal agencies of Pakistan finalized its plan to establish its own counterparts in East Pakistan. The agreement on federal rule stipulates East Pakistan would have its own agencies and not be under federal authorities based in West Pakistan. East Pakistani personnel within these existing agencies are spearheading the new departments being setup in Dacca. The agreement is being widely praised in both wings, though there still does not exist a mechanism to deal with any contradictions that may develop in policies or the implementation of legislation."
 Bangladesh_Federation.14.d:0 "The State Bank of Pakistan announced all its assets in East Pakistan will henceforth be known as the State Bank of East Pakistan. The new bank will have complete fiscal authority for East Pakistan. All banks operating in East Pakistan no longer have to register or maintain any assets in West Pakistan. The new bank promised to initiate a series of changes that will spur growth for East Pakistan. Economists in both wings believe there will likely be a major boom for the East Pakistan economy as federal fiscal policies in the past largely focused on West Pakistani growth."
 Bangladesh_Federation.15.d:0 "After closed door discussions, an agreement regarding the final status of East Pakistan was reach. The Pakistan President announced the details after concluding his long discussions with East Pakistani political leaders. East Pakistan will retain its pro-federation constitution and increased control over its own development. However, foreign policy, the national economy, and defence will remain under the purview of federal authority. Legislation passed in East Pakistan must be in compliance with the national constitution. The agreement is being lauded in both wings as a true political compromise. The only criticism is arising from pro-autonomy parties like the Awami League in East Pakistan. These groups see the agreement as a capitulation to West Pakistani demands and call the autonomy promised in the agreement an illusion. These criticisms have not caused street protests so it appears all Pakistanis are willing to give this new political structure a chance."
 Bangladesh_Federation.16.d:0 "Discussions between the Pakistan President and the recently elected East Pakistani officials concluded after exhausting talks. The pro-autonomy Awami League were said to be making extensive demands on the federal government. Counter proposals were largely rejected by both sides. After talks dragged an extra two weeks it was decided that East Pakistan would gain sovereignty, but maintain a diplomatic alliance. Bangladesh plans to hold fresh polls while Pakistan prepares to face a new future. Although many Pakistanis will be disappointed, most understood accepting East Pakistan as a virtually independent province would provide a dangerous precedent in the future."
 Bangladesh_Federation.17.d:0 "The decision to release Bangladesh was a difficult one for the President. However, the East Pakistani leadership was not willing to compromise on its extreme demands on autonomy. The Pakistani military and political elite recognized such a scenario would lead to greater political turmoil if other provinces demanded similar concessions. The President noted the East Pakistani leadership wanted the majority of National Assembly seats while enjoying virtual independence, an unacceptable scenario. Maintaining a diplomatic and military alliance will go a long way in legitimizing the separation as a mutual separation made by brothers. There will be a period of transition, but much of the separation process had already occurred during the recent federation period."

 BAN_2AL.0.d:0 "Bangladesh completed its second general election since independence. The people are eagerly awaiting the results. Voter participation was observed to be very high. Although there is a sense of excitement, these elections are not expected to be a cakewalk for the ruling Awami League. The volume of challenges and crisis hitting the last government has opened an opportunity for conservative parties to gain support. The Awami League continues to promise the implementation of socialism for the people, noting the challenges recently faced reflected what happens when a society lifts the shackles of slavery put on the people from previous regimes. The conservative parties, running together as a coalition, condemn the Awami League for corruption, mismanagement, and a desire to achieve political domination. Experts and observers are unsure which side has the edge."
 BAN_2AL.1.d:0 "Bangladesh faces unprecedented challenges. The government continues to be attacked by the opposition, which does not hesitate to publish false news to enflame the population. If we are to implement our vision for the nation, some in the party suggest a radical solution. They want to push through a constitution amendment banning all political parties for national unity. The President can then declare a state of emergency and create a one-party state. We can then bring all political leaders under the President and carry out our agenda completely. However, this step maybe too radical, a decision must be made."
 BAN_2AL.2.d:0 "The Parliament of Bangladesh narrowly passed a new amendment allowing the President to ban any political party during a state of emergency. Despite vehement protests from the opposition, who claim the new law is ripe for abuse, it was passed. The President states the bill will ensure an emergency situation can be handled efficiently. The reaction from the media has been mixed. Pro-government publications note the heightened political climate means such laws must be passed. The opposition press is arguing the bill lays the groundwork for a political takeover by the government."
 BAN_2AL.3.d:0 "In light of the increasingly unstable political environment, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a state of emergency. Per his emergency powers, the President declared all political parties are to be banned. He stated his intentions to provide a meaningful solution to the political infighting in the country. The opposition leaders could not be reached for comment, most are under police protection. Although Mujibur Rahman promised to restore normalcy, many in the country are unsure what normalcy will mean."
 BAN_2AL.4.d:0 "President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a new political party called the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League or BaKSAL. All politicians are required to join, including all sitting members of parliament. A new cabinet, consisting of members from all major political parties will govern the nation. Mujibur Rahman calls the new party as essential to establishing political harmony and unity. With the political leadership united, Bangladesh can finally embrace its destiny. Due to press censorships, it is unclear how the public is reacting. However, the foreign press notes a general, uneasy quietness among the people, indicating some discontent may be present."
 BAN_2AL.5.d:0 "The civil service traces its origins to the colonial era. Many of the top officials are from that period. They are influenced heavily by those imperialist ideals. As such, they often drag their feet or perform inadequately in implementing our vision for the country. Some senior members in the party believe we should institute a rehaul and replace senior members with party loyalists. We can also appoint supporters to key posts to build patronage. However, this may have unforeseen consequences, it may be better to keep the civil service separate from politics."
 BAN_2AL.6.d:0 "Our efforts at replacing the civil service with party loyalists has provided us with greater support, especially from the regional parties. However, the civil service is said to be losing morale. Many of the more experienced officers are said to be upset with losing promotions and being placed under unqualified party members. More significantly, a number of valuable officers have resigned in disgust, hindering the training of their replacements. It will take a number of years before the civil service returns to its previous level of efficiency."
 BAN_2AL.7.d:0 "Our decision to leave the civil service separate from politics has resulted in some setbacks. Many regional parties are complaining that policies initiated from Dacca are not being implemented efficiently. This is eroding support for government initiatives. In addition, more civil service agents are entering senior positions and their predecessors are retiring. This is putting strain on the budget as we must pay increasing salaries along with pensions. Despite these setbacks, there is a new generation of officers entering the service who may prove to be more efficient in time."
 BAN_2AL.8.d:0 "India has a long history of supporting our cause. However, many Bangladeshis view India with hostility. This stems from the violence of partition and our border issues. As a nation, we are desperate for economic and military support to secure our development. India has the resources to help us immediately. We can reach out to India for comprehensive talks, this could provide a major boon. However, the opposition will likely see such an effort as an example of their ridiculous claims the Awami League is a puppet of India."
 BAN_2AL.9.d:0 "The Bangladeshi government recently reached out, inquiring about holding comprehensive talks. The Bangladeshis are seeking military equipment and economic advisors. We can certainly provide at least the economic support. However, there are some in the Foreign Ministry who feel Bangladesh has a history of taking our support while continuing to press a narrative of confrontation, especially with regards to border issues. They suggest we should just focus the discussions on expanding bilateral relations. We should consider how to approach the talks."
 BAN_2AL.10.d:0 "Our government recently concluded a series of new agreements with India. Although we emphasized the benefits of the agreement, there has been a substantial backlash. The opposition and nationalists accuse us of once again kowtowing to the regional power. Several demonstrations are planned in the coming days. Despite the backlash, the agreement overall will benefit the nation and allow us to implement our vision for Bangladesh. To prevent further protest, we decided to cancel an upcoming press conference with the Indian ambassador lauding the recent agreements."

 BAN_CC.1.d:0 "The Civil Service, its exam system, and recruitment is deeply rooted with the colonial system. There is increasing pressure to institute reforms of the curriculum and requirements. Doing so would allow a larger portion of the population access to such a career. The reforms would involve removing some of the Western language requirements and replace elements of the curriculum with more focus on the cultural environment of Bangladesh. These measures would take time to implement and there would be a drop in efficiency. Critics to the measures also question the need to change a bureaucratic structure that has remained relatively efficient and entirely apolitical since independence. The cabinet will need to make a decision."
 BAN_CC.2.d:0 "The government is preparing to unveil a privatization campaign for Khulna. The campaign will be essential to convince the Bangladeshi people that nationalization is a doomed policy, vulnerable to corruption and limited growth. The campaign will see us sell off unprofitable state industries to help spur the development of Khulna as a financial center for the nation. We hope by the end, we will not only help support a financial revolution but also see our industrial production increase as these unprofitable state enterprises enter the private sector. The Finance Minister is so confident, he has proposed a revised plan, calling for us to maximize the sell-off of state enterprises for an even greater success. The President must decide whether to take the recommendation or keep the plan as envisioned."
 BAN_CC.3.d:0 "The recent Privatization Campaign has resulted in a tremendous success for the government. The selloff of many state enterprises initially caught the nation by surprise, with many leftist publications calling it a blatant betrayal of the worker. However, it is clear many of these former state businesses are flourishing under private ownership, boosting the industrial production of the nation and providing more jobs for workers. More importantly, the free-up of capital enabled the government to incentivize Khulna as a major financial center for the region. Many banks, including from abroad, are taking advantage of government incentives to setup in the city. The government is enjoying unprecedented popularity."
 BAN_CC.4.d:0 "The recent Privatization Campaign has ended in failure for the government. Despite promises that the sell-off of unprofitable state enterprises would lead to growth and innovation from the private sector, this has not materialized. Many of these new, privatized businesses are on the verge of collapse. A failure to expand production or growth has seen many of the businesses cut staff and salaries, leading to intense labor conflicts. This ended up forcing the government to intervene and prop up some of these businesses to prevent violence on the streets. Ultimately, the government had to abandon its plan and admit its efforts resulted in a decline in industrial growth. The opposition is taking every opportunity to embarrass the government over its failure."
 BAN_CC.5.d:0 "The recent Privatization Campaign is proving to be a success for the government. The selloff of state enterprises initially caught the many by surprise, with some leftist publications calling it a blatant betrayal of the worker. However, it is clear most of these former state businesses are flourishing under private ownership, boosting the industrial production for the nation and providing more jobs and at times, higher wages for workers. More importantly, the free-up of capital enabled the government to incentivize Khulna as a major financial center for the region. The influx of financial institutions, especially regional banks are transforming the region. The government is enjoying increased popularity over its program."
 BAN_CC.6.d:0 "The government quietly announced it would suspend its Privatization Campaign. Despite promises that the sell-off of some unprofitable state enterprises would lead to growth and innovation from the private sector, this has not materialized. Many of these new, privatized businesses are on the verge of collapse.

Ultimately, the government admitted its program had only resulted in a decline in industrial growth. The opposition is taking every opportunity to embarrass the government over its failure."
 BAN_CC.7.d:0 "The coalition of conservative parties currently ruling Bangladesh recently signed a party constitution to form a unified political party called the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The signatories, all the party leaders of coalition members, agreed to serve under the President and immediately relinquish their parties to a new Central Committee. The announcement of the new party completely transforms the political landscape in Bangladesh. The Awami League, which has traditionally dominated the political left now has an opponent with an equal dominance over the political right in the country. The BNP is being lauded as a stabilizing force for Bangladeshi politics."

 JSD_Insurgency.100.d:0 "The Chatra League, which is the youth wing of the Awami League recently split. Many of the activists expressed dismay over what they perceived is the lack of revolutionary zeal from the government. In particular, they oppose the use of Islam by government officials and lack of prosecution of those they believe are traitors to the nation. The dissidents have formed their own group called the Jatiya Samamtantrik Dal (JSD). This is a troubling development as the new group, consisting of college students and young military officers have also established a secret militant wing called the Gonobhani. There are reports of students abandoning their dorms along with soldiers deserting their units to meet in the jungle. We must watch the situation closely.”
 JSD_Insurgency.101.d:0 "A recent spate of assassinations has rocked the nation and Awami Party. These blatant shootings and bombings are being claimed by the JSD and its militant wing, the Gonobhani. They claim the government is betraying the nation and lack a revolutionary spirit. They advocate for a complete socialist revolution for Bangladesh. The JSD consists of former Chatra League members who split from the group several months earlier. Military and police units are reporting on increased incidents involving armed fighters. The JSD has declared war on Bangladesh, but the government will not give in to their demands.”
 JSD_Insurgency.102.d:0 "Peaceful protestors supporting the JSD were met with gunfire from the government paramilitary force called the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini (JRB). The JSD claimed up to sixty protestors were killed, while the government says the figure is five or six. The shooting took place after JSD protestors moved to surround the residence of the Home Minister. The protestors were incensed about reports blaming corruption for a recent spike in inflation across the country. The JRB claimed the protestors were out of control and to prevent a series incident, utilized force. The shooting has sparked anger across many Bangladeshis who increasingly see the JRB as an armed wing of the ruling Awami League. The JRB also faces accusations of torture and illegal detentions."

 JSD_Insurgency.1.d:0 "The JSD relies heavily on their contacts within our ranks and government. We recently took advantage of this. An officer had been approached by JSD sympathizers about aiding their cause. He informed our intelligence agents who arranged for him to be a double agent. He has so far identified several JSD cells and suspected sympathizers. We are keeping a close eye on them and preventing them from gaining damaging intelligence. With assets like these we will eventually tear apart their supporters within the military and restore order to the nation.”

Unfortunately, the JSD appeared to have realized our plan. They played us and our officer has disappeared. He had identified several JSD sympathizers in the unit, but this information has proven to be false. This was a major setback for our intelligence operatives, we must rethink the tactics used to unearth JSD infiltrators in the ranks.”
 JSD_Insurgency.3.d:0 "The JSD consist of miscreants and thieves bent on causing lawlessness and violence among the people. There fighters are more adept to steal and kill civilians than engage in combat. This was proven recently when our soldiers identified a JSD cell operating in their area. An assault was launched which flushed out the enemy, inflicting casualties on them. Prisoners were also taken. Not only have we restored order in the area but we have gained valuable intelligence on the enemy operations. This is a great victory for the nation.”
 JSD_Insurgency.4.d:0 "We know the JSD consists of an armed mob more effective at terrorizing civilians than engaging our military forces. Unfortunately, one of our military units overconfidently sought to assault a JSD outpost in the jungle. They failed proper reconnaissance, leading to their attack being thwarted by an entrenched enemy. Our men took casualties and were forced to withdraw in disarray. The JSD is portraying it as a major victory and the morale of our soldiers in the area is very low. We will need time to restore order and rebuild confidence.”
 JSD_Insurgency.5.d:0 "Friendly civilians noted a sizeable JSD camp located in the jungles near their village. Sending troops would only cause them to flee or fortify their stronghold. A brave officer volunteered to dress as a civilian, with a radio and explore the claims. He managed to identify the camp and its coordinates. The local artillery unit than launched a bombardment. Our forces investigated the targeted site, discovering enemy casualties along with evidence the site had been an arms depot. Valuable intelligence documents were also gained as the cowardly JSD fled the area. This is a major victory for our forces.”
 JSD_Insurgency.6.d:0 "Friendly civilians noted a sizeable JSD camp located in the jungles near their village. Sending troops would only cause them to flee or fortify their stronghold. A brave officer volunteered to dress as a civilian, with a radio and explore the claims. He managed to identify the camp and its coordinates. Unfortunately, the coordinates appear to have been misunderstood. The artillery strike missed the target and some shells fell within the village. The locals, who were once pro-government, are infuriated. We must work to correct these mistakes, but the failure has weakened our influence in the contested area.”
 JSD_Insurgency.7.d:0 "The JSD officially seized control of the Bangladesh government. They had recently achieved a string of major military successes. As their fighters approached Dacca, JSD sympathizers within the military acted, seizing control of units and detaining officers loyal to the government. Senior Bangladeshi political and military leaders are now under arrest. The JSD leadership took control of state media and released a statement. They promised the implementation of a true socialist revolution in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi people await the future with great apprehension as there are fears the new regime may unleash a reign of terror.”
 JSD_Insurgency.8.d:0 "The Bangladesh government confirmed the JSD has largely ceased to exist as a threat. This comes after a series of military successes by the Bangladeshi Army over the rebels. The government notes the JSD may have sympathizers remaining in the military, but these cells will be rooted out. One senior official noted the JSD is so weakened that these cells lack any leadership cell to call upon. This is a major success for the government. JSD members who did not engage in armed struggle will be granted amnesty to help restore unity in the country.”

Fearing increased corruption and state repression, the group decided to launch an insurgency against the government. The JSD wishes to overthrow the Awami League, replace the old guard and bring a true socialist vision for the nation.\n\n[?ROOT.JSD_Strength|R]%"

#FOCUS DESCS
#Mixed Economy Growth (description)
#"The recent economic initiatives have set Bangladesh on a path of a true mixed economy. We will gain the benefits of both a free market and socialist economy. Providing the potential of growth while also preserving the people from exploitation. Balancing our economy is the key for the stable economic growth of Bangladesh."
#Seize Pakistan Assets (Description)
#"A number of private Pakistani corporations and businessmen continue to hold assets. These carpetbaggers have long drained our wealth to their bank accounts in Lahore. We will seize these assets in the name of the people."
#-5 year spirit "Seized Pakistan Assets" should lower consumer good demand
#Expand Worker Rights (Description)
#"The previous regime and the British colonial state long suppressed the rights of workers in our land. The time to rectify this is now. The government will recognize unions and legalize the right to strike."
#-5 year spirit "Expanded Worker Rights" increase in stability, increase in consumer good demand
#Restore Rural Order (Description)
#"The advent of independence revealed chaos in the countryside. Local administrators and police abandoned their post. The government must re-establish police stations and a sense of security to the people."
#Invite Pakistan to Liquidate Assets (description)
#"Pakistani nationals still possess a number of assets across Bangladesh. It is a legacy of the exploitation our people faced. Although it is well within our rights to seize these assets, to do so would risk weakening our international standing and hurt foreign investment. Instead, we will offer these Pakistanis a fair compensation, and then liquidate these assets to the people of Bangladesh."
#Reduce Foreign Dependence (Description)
#"Our people have long been used as a source of exploitation by foreign powers. As such, the economy is structured to facilitate this draining of national wealth abroad. The government will initiate a series of tariffs and ban certain imports to spur the emergence of a national economy." (leads to spirit "Tariffs and Protections" should give boost to infra/factory construction but also increase the costs)
#Transitioning to Mixed Economy (description)
#"Our five year plan has successfully put Bangladesh on the path of economic independence and equality. The exploitive elements of our economy are being removed while the foundation for a new economy of socialism and equality is laid out."
#Modernize Water Distribution (Description)
#"The government announced a new initiative to modernize water distribution across rural areas of the country. The old infrastructure is now decades old and in need of an upgrade. The effort is being widely praised as an example of state institutions cooperating for the betterment of the people."
#Remove AL Members From Civil Service (description)
#"Die-hard Awami League members, many lacking the proper qualifications or training, were appointed to key civil service posts. In order to restore order and reduce corruption, these Awami League members must be removed."
#Rehabilitate Former Bureaucrats (description)
#"The previous government removed those civil servants trained in the colonial or Pakistan period. Often replacing them with political appointees who lacked proper qualifications. The government will bring these officials back to the civil service. Appointments will be based on qualification and experience, not political allegiance."
#Strengthen Local Police Forces (description)
#"The overly centralized style of governance by the previous regime meant local institutions were declining rapidly. This gave way to a rise in criminal activity, especially in the countryside. This heavily hindered the internal movement of goods and services. The government will initiate a new program to pump funds to local police units and re-introduce pre-independence officers who had been forced into early retirement."
#Deploy Troops in the Countryside (description)
#"The centralized style of rule from the previous government meant very little resources were available to the rural areas, especially the police. As such, smuggling, violence, and robbery are a major problem. To tackle this issue, the government will deploy Army troops from cantonments to bolster the local police and restore order."
#Empower Local Councils (description)
#"The government announced plans to give extensive powers to Local Councils established across rural areas of the country. Many villages complained the previous, centralized system moved too slowly, unable to react effectively to important issues. The Local Councils will ensure effective governance by local people trusted in the villages."
#Investigate Suspected Officers (description)
#"The President understands the previous period of political instability was driven by military officers deeply engaged with politics. Chain of command was often ignored and politicians could call on specific units to protect them. The military is launching an extensive investigation to identify, dismiss, or reform, any personnel found to be engaged in politics or anti-state ideologies. Chain of command must be restored."
#Restore Army Discipline (description)
#"Military officers of various ranks have been involving themselves in politics and unsanctioned violence. In some units commanding officers are powerless in the face of politically connected subordinates. This situation is intolerable, President Ziaur has ordered a thorough crackdown on insubordination from top to bottom."
#Support Bangladesh Nationalism (description)
#"The Awami League and others advocated a cultural, Bengali nationalism. However, this leaves out the Biharis and other minorities in the country. Instead, the country should embrace a new nationalism based on a Bangladeshi identity, not an exclusively Bengali one."
#Re-Islamisation of Bangladesh (description)
#"The traditional Islamic greeting, the call to prayer, and invocation of Islam when starting official government events will become standard practice. The nation remains secular, however, the previous governments were promoting a secularism at the expense of the Islamic identity of Bangladeshis. This will no longer be tolerated."
#Establish Gram Sarkar (description)
#"The new self-government village system called Gram Sarkar will give local authorities a much wider breadth of government power. This will expand democracy on the grassroots level to the people. Government initiatives meant to lift rural people will also be more effectively carried out on the village level."
#Establish Village Defence Party (description)
#"With the success of the Gram Sarkar system, a new Village Defence Party system is being implemented. This will allow the local councils to control, direct, and fund village police/self-defence patrols. The new reform will strengthen security in the villages and finally curb the lawlessness of rural Bangladesh."
#Youth Workshops  (description)
#"The Awami League and its youth wing spent years fostering ties with university and secondary school students. President Ziaur wishes to harness this youth power away from partisan politics. The government will organize Youth Workshops across the country for young people to learn and promote Bangladeshi nationalism."
#Population Planning (description)
#"The leading economists in the country note our high birthrate is the greatest threat to sustainable, economic growth. The economy will eventually be completely unable to match its growth with the increase in population. To combat this issue, a new national campaign, targeting communities with high birthrates, will educate the population on the benefits of family planning."
#Establish BJR Research Institute (description)
#"The President opened the Bangladesh Jute and Rice Institute. This new facility, the first of several planned, will improve agricultural research and planning for the nation. Top researchers and officials will study at the institute and be able to implement experiments to improve the agricultural sector of the economy."
#New Infrastructure Program (description)
#"A healthy national economy relies on the fast, efficient movement of goods across domestic markets. The government announced a new focus and funding initiative to support the construction of new infrastructure projects to better connect all the people of Bangladesh."
#Reverse Collectivization (description)
#"The first government sought to implement agricultural collectivization. However, the practice was alien to our peasants and saw a major drop in production. The President announced plans to end collectivization schemes across the country and return farms to the producers."
#Expand Rural Electrification (description)
#"The rural areas have been neglected by the state since the Mughals ruled the land. Yet these peasants make the backbone of our economy. To aid their lives and offer more opportunities, the government announced the opening of new power plants meant to provide electricity to neglected communities."
#Ban All Political Parties (description)
#"The JSD Central Committee confirmed a ban on all political parties in Bangladesh. It noted the state must be supreme and undivided by partisan politics. All political offices are directed to shutdown and all materials for non-JSD political parties are to be confiscated for destruction."
#Complete Secularization (description)
#"The government announced a ban on the use of any Islamic phrasing on government materials, media broadcasts, or by party officials addressing the population. The JSD claims it is not suppressing Islam, but simply establishing the conditions of a secular state, as envisioned by the founders of Bangladesh. Grassroot Muslim community leaders are said to be infuriated by this change of policy."
#Codify Central Committees (description)
#"The Central Committee finalized its rules, regulations, and powers. They have been bound and released to the public. The decision to write down and release the procedures of the Central Committee are meant to provide the public confidence in their leaders. Critics claim the JSD operates with impunity, but the written records of state organs prove those critics wrong."
#Formalize Rural Militias (description)
#"The rural militias formed to protect the people from criminal elements and corrupt government officials are to be formalized as part of the military. The military are to incorporate these forces when necessary and provide them with access to weapons and facilities. Some military officers are complaining the militias are not compatible, but those officers will soon be brought in to be educated on the merits of our plan."
#Expand Collectivization (description)
#"Agriculture remains a critical component of the economy. Our people were long victims of landlords and colonial exploitation. To make the land fertile and break the feudal class, the government announced a new plan to expand collectivization across the country. This will help bring the early end to the feudal landlord classes."
#Confiscate Excess Wealth (description)
#"The elite landlord classes along with urban capitalists have spent centuries working with enemies of the people to steal the wealth of the nation for themselves. This will no longer be the case. Banks are directed to confiscate funds from individuals who have wealth far beyond what is necessary. For those holding excessive properties, they will be forced to hand much of that income to the state."
#Urban Infrastructure Project (description)
#"The Urban Development Project Phase I is nearing completion. It will provide strong urban infrastructure improvements, to better prepare the nation for an industrial revolution. The project highlights how strong the nation is when it comes together."
#Youth Programs (description)
#"The government announced a series of Youth Programs across the country. These involve civil education, sports, and the arts. This will encourage unity, education, and patriotism among the people of Bangladesh."
#Bengali Cultural Programs (description)
#"Colonialism and the early post-colonial period saw the continued, sustained assault on the language, literature, and art of Bengalis. The government will launch an extensive program to teach the people their heritage and foster patriotism. With a devotion to the nation, the people will be eager to make the sacrifices for the national cause."
#National Bank Reform (description)
#"Private banks remain a bane to the existence of so many Bangladeshi workers. Our own state banks are often too focused on macro-economic issues. A series of new reforms will expand the number of government banks and focus on providing support for the people."
#Empower Local Governments (description)
#"The previous government focused heavily on centralizing power to the capital. As a result, rural areas and provincial cities were neglected. The President announced several new initiatives to promote local governments and improve the condition of those areas outside the capital."
#Reduce Regulations (description)
#"Over regulation stifles economic growth, especially regulations with regards to financing. The Finance Minister announced new measures to encourage the flow of capital in the public and private sector. Despite the promises of new growth, there are some concerns with regards to inflation."
#Agricultural Reform (description)
#"A series of measures will end the forced adoption of communal farming among rural communities. The government claims these measures were akin to colonial efforts at implementing their own artificial view of agriculture in the colonial period. In addition, new funds are being allocated to boost university research in agriculture and send top students abroad to learn from premier agricultural institutions."
#Proclaim a New Constitution (description)
#"After intense debates and discussion, the Constituent Assembly for East Pakistan is prepared to reveal its constitution for the people of East Pakistan. All of Pakistan anxiously awaits to see what type of autonomy and government the people wish." (as noted, once this is complete, depending on player’s choice in previous tree, either constitution a or constitution b event launches)
#Awami League Government (description)
#"Despite calls for a unity government, the people overwhelmingly support the agenda of the Awami League. It would not be fair to deny the people their choice just to ease the ego of the opposition. The Awami League will bring socialism, secularism, and prosperity to the people."
#Form the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini (description)
#"Bangladesh faces unprecedented security challenges, especially in rural areas. Armed bands and corrupt officials run rampant. To solve the issue a new force called the Jatiya Rakhi Bahini has formed. It will become a paramilitary force to target violent groups and support law enforcement. The military is said to be angered as resources and manpower will be diverted from it to arm the group."
#Rehabilitate Displaced Bengalis (description)
#"The chaos of independence displaced many Bengalis, form both rural and urban areas. However, an aggressive effort to relocate and place these families is bearing fruit. The experience of Partition has helped guide this process. This is offering many economic opportunities, especially for those looking to bring in new labor."
#Nationalize Industries (description)
#"Nationalism is a major component of our agenda. The Finance Minister has laid out a vision for beginning the process of gradually nationalizing industries in the country. The process will consist of nationalizing existing industries while supporting efforts to establish new state firms."
#Compulsory Islamic Education (description)
#"For far too long, the Islamic beliefs of our people were neglected by advocates of outside ideologies. This has led to a drop in public morals and crisis of identity. To save future generations, the Education Ministry announced plans to make Islamic Studies a compulsory class for all Bangladeshi children."
#Approach Pakistan for Final Status (description)
#"With the new constitution in force, elections, and a partition of responsibilities, the stage is set for a final decision on the Pakistan Federation. The President of Pakistan is set to meet with the senior East Pakistani leadership. The discussions are expected to last at least two weeks. The main issue will be how to integrate the new changes in East Pakistan with the federal government. Pro-autonomy advocates wish to see East Pakistan emerge virtually independent, holding a military and diplomatic partnership with Pakistan. Pro-federation supporters hope East Pakistan can once again go under federal rule but with a degree of autonomy."
#Rural Banking Reform (description)
#"The government announced plans to establish more government banks in rural areas. These will provide more loans to spur rural growth. More importantly, farmers will be able to make payments in their agricultural goods instead of cash."
#Unity Government (description)
#"The Awami League announced the formation of a unity government. It has agreed to give some cabinet posts to opposition members and keep them abreast of policy. The decision is being widely praised as an act of political maturity that will only strengthen democracy for the young democracy."
