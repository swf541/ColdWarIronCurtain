 STALIN_Heavy_Industry_Development_desc:0 "While we have large industrial centers across our nation, our capacity to produce heavy equipment and machinery still lags behind that of Western powerhouses like the US. Only a concerted effort to develop our industry will change that."
 STALIN_The_Iron_Curtain_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Our sphere of influence has grown to encompass all of Eastern Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Winston Churchill, our one time ally, has called the divide between us and the West 'The Iron Curtain', a sign of the growing gap between our individual goals. He is right. The Capitalists must learn their place in the world or be shown to it through force."
 STALIN_Confirm_Stalins_Omnipotence_desc:0 "Our Glorious Leader, Comrade Josef Stalin, is practically God in the Soviet Union. At his command people live and die. Through his words, people eat or starve, cry or laugh, work or rest. Already an unopposed ruler, we need to recognize his omnipotence."
 STALIN_The_Soviet_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "Our military is one of the most powerful in the world- when it comes to size. However, we lag behind the West's level of research and development in several key areas, most notably jet technology and any semblance of a proper navy."
 
 STALIN_Catch_Up_with_Western_Atomic_Research_desc:0 "Nuclear Power- both weaponized and peaceful- will be one of the deciding factors in the upcoming struggle for survival, and we cannot afford to remain behind the Americans in this field."
 STALIN_Utilize_German_Rocketry_Knowledge_desc:0 "When we swept through Germany at the end of the Great Patriotic War 5 years ago, we captured many prominent German scientists, among them a few highly skilled rocket engine researchers. By putting them to work we can advance our knowledge."
 STALIN_Prioritize_Electronic_Developments_desc:0 "New advances are being made in the electronics department daily in the West, and yet much of our rural areas lack basic power facilities. We need to improve their infrastructure as well as keep up with the high tech advances of our day."
 STALIN_Aid_Ukranian_Reconstruction_desc:0 "Ukraine in particular was hard hit by the Nazi dogs during their brief occupation, and much of its infrastructure was destroyed. A large effort will need to be made to restore it."
 STALIN_Rebuild_Ukranian_Agriculture_desc:0 "The Fascists also ruined the region's farms and food producing industries when they invaded, shipping much of the goods and supplies back to their homeland. Our people are already rationing food, so we need to get the Bread Basket of West Russia up and running again."
 STALIN_Rebuild_Destroyed_Dams_desc:0 "Many dams were destroyed during the war, damaging many villages in the area surrounding them as well as taking away the dams' ability to provide hydroelectric power. Both of those reasons are more than enough for us to start repairing dams."
 STALIN_Invest_in_the_Baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic region has suffered much in the past few decades, being assimilated into the Union less than a few years before being run over by the German War Machine, and then bearing the effects of Scorched Earth policies. Investing in to the area will only do good."
 STALIN_Rebuild_Stalingrad_desc:0 "Stalingrad is home of the graves of many heroes of the Union, and site of one of our finest moments of the Great Patriotic War. However, all that doesn't change the devastation it saw during the battle for it, and we need to restart its industries. "
 STALIN_Open_New_Metallurgy_Plants_desc:0 "Rare Earth Metals are becoming more and more important for the production of high tech electronics and advanced weapons and vehicles, and increasing our mining and production ventures will benefit us greatly."
 STALIN_Complete_the_Don_Volga_Canal_desc:0 "The Don-Volga Canal is an important project, vital to our Agricultural sector in the South of the Union, and by completing it we will improve local infrastructure and food production capabilities."
 STALIN_Repair_Mining_Pits_desc:0 "By repairing mining pits and the overall industry, we can increase our metal exports and production."
 STALIN_Eliminate_Infrastructure_Bottlenecks_desc:0 "The state of our roads and general infrastructure, while being a useful tool to slow the Nazi advance, is in a miserable state for peacetime commerce, and must be improved."
 STALIN_Increase_Cement_Production_desc:0 "Cement is a vital material for the construction of all kinds of things, from bridges and roads to buildings and fortifications, and we need to have more of it."
 STALIN_Build_New_Railways_desc:0 "Building new railways is a good way to improve regional infrastructure as well as make it easier to transport goods and troops."
 STALIN_Connect_the_Union_desc:0 "To complete our new industrial and infrastructure improvements, we should create a vast system of roads and highways to connect our vast country. From Leningrad in the Baltic to Sebastopol in the Black sea to Vladivostok in the far east, our comrade citizens will have freedom to travel like never before."
 
 STALIN_Follow_the_Percentage_Agreements_desc:0 "At the Yalta Conference, we agreed upon the limits of our sphere of influence. While we undoubtedly deserve more, we should stick to our word and not overstep our boundaries."
 STALIN_Abandon_Turkish_Claims_desc:0 "One of the issues we've been trying to press is that of the Turkish Straits, because ownership of them would give us full access to the Mediterranean and oceans beyond. However, it is outside our sphere, so we should abandon our claims."
 STALIN_Promote_Democratic_Route_to_Communism_desc:0 "Rather than forcing our Democratic neighbors to the Northeast to join  us, we should follow the Democratic process and promote various communist parties to help them win the next national elections."
 STALIN_Pressure_Yugoslavia_desc:0 "Marshal Tito and his allies in Yugoslavia are refusing to integrate into the Comintern, despite our natural similarities. We need to step up our diplomatic efforts to pressure them."
 STALIN_Fund_the_PCF_and_PCI_desc:0 "France and Italy already have strong Communist parties, but they are being strangled by government policy and radical attacks. We need to support our brethren abroad in any way we can."
 STALIN_Gather_Intelligence_Via_Western_Spies_desc:0 "By sending out spies into Western Countries and turning Western spies into agents of our own, we can increase our intelligence gathering capabilities."
 STALIN_Aid_the_Greek_Loyalists_desc:0 "Civil War has broken out in Greece, and the Communist forces are fighting bravely in the face of Western oppression and intervention. We know we agreed on having a set sphere of influence at Yalta, but we can't sit idly by and watch the fire of the Revolution go out."
 STALIN_Integrate_Greece_into_the_Eastern_Bloc_desc:0 "Now the the Greek Civil War has been resolved, with the Communists prevailing thanks to our aid, it is time to invite them to the Cominform along with the rest of Eastern Europe."
 STALIN_Maintain_Push_for_Turkish_Regime_Change_desc:0 "The Turkish Government, has, so far, pushed off our claims for the Straits and are hoping for Western support, but if we can force a regime change, the new government will just hand us what we want."
 STALIN_Redraw_Bosphorous_Borders_desc:0 "Now that that we have ensured a friendly Turkey, we can redraw the borders (one might say map paint) to whatever we want. We have 2 main goals here. The 1st, naturally, is our control of the Turkish Straits. The Second is the creation of a state for the oppressed Kurds in Turkey."
 STALIN_An_Ultimatum_to_Yugoslavia_desc:0 "Tito and Yugoslavia's impertinent attempts to ignore us and our requests have gone too far, and it is time they join us or face the might of the Red Army."
 STALIN_Maintain_Berlin_Blockade_desc:0 "The Americans and British are insisting we end our blockade of West Berlin, and allow free passage of food and goods into the city. Nonsense. We will not give in to Capitalist demands. The blockade will continue."
 STALIN_Cave_to_the_Western_Powers_desc:0 "Through the Berlin Airlift, the Americans have demonstrated the uselessness of a blockade of West Berlin, and it is time to give in and allow them to send supplies through to the city"
 STALIN_Allow_the_Foundation_of_a_German_State_for_Reperations_desc:0 "The East German territories have been under our control sine the end of World War Two as just that-territories, under a loose provisional government. It is time to begin the process of the creation of an East German State."
 STALIN_Deepen_COMECON_Collaboration_desc:0 "Our economic collaboration organization COMECON, has been a minor success so far, but we really need to deepen our ties to our Eastern European allies if we are to reap its full rewards."
 STALIN_Invest_in_the_Czech_and_Polish_Economy_desc:0 "The Czech and Polish Economies, not to mention their land and people, were deeply wounded by the Nazi occupation. We need to help them repair it."
 STALIN_Aid_Balkan_Reconstruction_desc:0 "The Balkans were home to some of the fiercest partisan fighting of the past war, and the infrastructure there is devastated as a result. It needs to be rebuilt."
 STALIN_Exploit_our_Eastern_Puppets_desc:0 "While we don't acknowledge this in public, the rest of the Cominform are little more than puppets and in reality must do everything we say. By exploiting their economies we can increase our own."
 STALIN_Increase_Ties_with_Mao_and_Kim_Il_Sung_desc:0 "Mao and Kim Il Sung are our greatest allies in the fight for Communism in the Far-East, and we need to increase the strength of our ties with them."

 STALIN_The_Korean_War_desc:0 "War in Korea! Kim Il Sung and his army have crossed the 38th Parallel and are striking deep into South Korea. We have 2 choices here- wait and see what happens, or take a more active role in ensuring the North's victory."
 STALIN_Send_Military_Advisors_desc:0 "Direct Intervention is too risky at this stage, but we can afford to send military 'advisors'. Whether they get involved in the conflict is not our problem."
 STALIN_Provide_Surplus_Tanks_and_Planes_desc:0 "The DPRK, while in no short supply of courage and valor, are in dire need of heavy armor and aircraft, and we can provided that with ease."
 STALIN_Send_Infantry_Equipment_desc:0 "Due to the heavy fighting, the North Korean army has experienced a large loss of equipment, and need more guns to continue the war. They'll get all they need from us."
 STALIN_Establish_the_64th_Fighter_Aviation_Corps_desc:0 "The 64th Fighter Aviation Corps will be a special air squadron of volunteers in North Korea that will be able to combat Western Jet aircraft in the skies."
 STALIN_Increase_Korean_Production_Capabilities_desc:0 "In addition to sending guns, tanks, and aircraft, we should also endeavor to increase North Korea's ability to manufacture their own equipment and become more self sufficient."
 
 STALIN_Purge_Seditous_Reactionaries_desc:0 "Our Union is being undermined by traitorous reactionary agents and Capitalist provocateurs. We need to undertake a serious effort to purge them all, no matter how damaging it may be."
 STALIN_Denounce_Leningrads_Fair_Embezzlement_desc:0 "The Communist Party branch in Leningrad is disloyal to Stalin, and we have the 'evidence' to get rid of them and any power they may have had. A large amount of evidence concerning serious graft and embezzlement has been found."
 STALIN_Purge_the_Leningrad_Dissenters_desc:0 "Now that we have the evidence indicating the Leningrad communists' guilt, we can strike and purge them through a series of trials."
 STALIN_Encourage_Anti_Semetism_desc:0 "The Jews are the source of all our problems. They pull the strings in the governments of our Capitalist enemies, and even the so called 'loyal' Jews here in the USSR refuse to fully submit to Party dogma and abandon their religion. We need to suppress them."
 STALIN_Dismantle_The_Jewish_Anti_Fascist_Committee_desc:0 "The JAC was originally formed under the guise of spreading the glory of Communism and the Union abroad to fellow Jewish communities, but it is now clear what they truly intend. The JAC is nothing more than a tool of the Bourgeoisie."
 STALIN_Secret_Trials_for_Jewish_Intellectuals_desc:0 "It has come to our glorious leader's attention that many notable Jewish intellectuals are working with Western Spies to undermine the Union. Show trials would cause too much international backlash so these trials must be kept secret."
 STALIN_Arrest_Treasonous_Doctors_desc:0 "Our spy system has gotten wind of a massive, disgusting, Jewish plot- the Jewish doctors of Moscow are going to poison Comrade Stalin and many other Communist Party officials! We need to act before they can carry out this horrible plan."
 STALIN_Force_Berias_Withdrawal_desc:0 "Lavrentiy Beria, while a useful henchman willing to carry out our schemes and purges, has lately gotten too many notions of grandeur. It is time for him to step down."
 STALIN_Purge_Mingrelians_from_the_Georgian_Party_desc:0 "In another effort to undermine Beria, we will attack his strongest supporters, the Georgian Mingrelian ethnic group. Hopefully he will finally learn his place after this."
 
 STALIN_The_Soviet_Airforce_desc:0 "Our air force was a large part of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, as our fearless aviators crushed the Luftwaffe into submission. But, a new age of flight has come, this time powered by the Jet Engine, and we need to leap into this age fullhearted."
 STALIN_Expand_MiG_15_Production_desc:0 "Mass production of the MiG-15, one of the best jet fighters our scientist comrades have produced to date, will do wonders for the Airforce's capabilities."
 STALIN_Develop_Sakhallin_Airfields_desc:0 "The Sakhalin airfields are the far-east region of our country's largest, but are still woefully small. Expanding them will benefit us greatly."
 STALIN_Develop_the_Tu_16_desc:0 "The Tu-16 is a proposed design for a Jet Strategic Bomber by Tupolev Industries, and it looks very promising. We should authorize further research and development. "

 STALIN_The_Soviet_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army was last in combat when it smashed the Wehrmacht and brought Berlin to its knees, winning us eternal glory in the Second World War. However, we cannot rest on our laurels, as warfare is ever changing and so must we."
 STALIN_Begin_Mass_Production_of_the_T54_desc:0 "The T-54 Main Battle Tank is our latest MBT design, and is far superior to any American tank in production. Distributing it throughout our army will increase our technological edge over the West."
 STALIN_Rapid_Adoption_of_the_AK47_desc:0 "The AK-47 is the latest brilliant design to come from Mikhail Kalashnikov, and it is a beautiful assault rifle with an innovative design- yet still cheap to manufacture. We need to start producing this right away."
 STALIN_Expand_the_VDV_desc:0 "The VDV is our elite paratrooper branch of the army. While the tactics and strategies for their use are still being formed, Airborne soldiers are still good to have around."
 STALIN_Increase_Soviet_Air_Defense_Forces_desc:0 "In addition to our Aircraft, ground anti-air units are also responsible for the defense of our skies. Increasing such units will in turn increase our defense capability."
 
 STALIN_The_Soviet_Navy_desc:0 "The Soviet Navy is small, weak, and outdated. Without even a carrier to our name, we can never hope to match the Americans on the high seas. However, we cannot ignore our surface or submarine fleets entirely."
 STALIN_Project_30bis_desc:0 "Project 30bis is the name for a modern, top of the line destroyer which will greatly enhance our Navy's escort capabilities, and we should invest in it heavily."
 STALIN_Modernize_the_Black_Sea_Shipyards_desc:0 "While the dockyards on the Black Sea are many, they are also quite outdated and inefficient. This needs to change, and soon."
 STALIN_Study_German_Submarine_Designs_desc:0 "We captured quite a few German Submarines- and the researchers who designed them- at the end of the Second World War. By studying U-Boat designs, we can improve our own submarine fleet."
 STALIN_Ramp_Up_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "Submarines are the only chance we have at doing any damage to Western Ships or shipping if we ever come to conflict. We need to make sure our fleet is up to the task."
 
 STALIN_Chase_the_Industrial_Power_Dream_desc:0 "We have long chased the dream of being an industrial powerhouse with complete economic self-sufficiency and thanks to our recent efforts, are closer than ever to reaching that goal. It is time to take our fate in hand and finally achieve our dreams."
 STALIN_Direct_Intervention_desc:0 "We can't risk Kim Il Sung's regime collapsing under the force of a NATO onslaught. No fooling around here. Direct Intervention is much more preferable to a more passive role."
 STALIN_Integration_of_the_Korean_Peninsula_desc:0 "Now that we have defeated the Capitalists in the Korean War, it is time for the DPRK to join us and our allies in the Cominform."
 STALIN_Ensure_the_Survival_of_the_Kim_Regime_desc:0 "Now that the war is over, it would be shame if we let Kim Il Sung's regime collapse and all our efforts go to waste. We need to guarantee his government's survival to show the West we mean business."
