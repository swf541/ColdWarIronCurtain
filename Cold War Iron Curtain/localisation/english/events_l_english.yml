 Currency.1.d:0 "An official message conveyed by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan alongside former members of the Transjordan caucus announced the creation of the kingdom's official national currency. The Jordanian Dinar is set to replace the previous Palestinian pound, a relic currency of the previous British Palestinian administration of the region. Since Jordan's independence in 1946, ideas of the implementation and creation of a national currency were popular among all political spectrums. Currently in 1949, the Provisional Act.35 responsible for such a creation of currency has been passed unanimously in Jordan. Expectations from the recently formed Jordan Currency Board suggest that the Dinar will be officially implemented by July 1, 1950, officially ceasing acceptance to outdated British Palestine currency. Specifications of the currency in accordance to the Jordan Currency Board suggest: Coin denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100. As for banknotes, denominations will include 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Dinar. Once more the world can witness the birth, of a new currency."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate.

The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost.

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

 cwu.311.d:0 "\nWith the hopes of democracy and human rights in Hungary slipping away, the United States has issued an ultimatum to the Soviet Union, calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Hungary, ending their occupation over the region, and recognize the sovereignty of the Third Republic of Hungary. Such an ultimatum was unexpected, since observers expected America to intervene in a supportive capacity, not directly. The Soviets are yet to respond, but both sides have already begun evacuating their officials and deploying troops throughout the border regions of the Iron Curtain."
 cwu.312.d:0 "\nThe independence and sovereignty of the Hungarian nation has been once more restored. The Kremlin has issued a statement that they've \"unconditionally withdrawn\" troops from Hungary, ending their occupation. This represents a major diplomatic victory for America, not only have they made a new ally ally Hungary, but they have successfully pressured the Soviet Union into submission. While Washington celebrates, the Politburo is planning a purge of their diplomatic staff for their failures. Observers stated that this event is a wake-up call to other nations under Soviet influence, and they predict the fall of the USSR sooner than expected should the Soviets fail to secure their control over their dominions."
 cwu.313.d:0 "\nFearing a large scale military conflict to engulf the world once more, the United States of America has retracted their ultimatum, stating that the Hungarian revolutionaries are only dedicated to democracy out of convenience, and intend to establish a dictatorial regime that is inherently anti-democratic. In reality, America fears for another world war, since the Soviets are rapidly advancing their nuclear arsenal, and that if they use it, all of humanity is lost. This is a major diplomatic victory for the Soviets, for they have not only secured their sphere of influence over Hungary, but have unintentionally allowed America to acquiesce to their goals. Observers believe that America needs a decisive action now, or Communism will engulf the world, as security under the America umbrella is under threat." 
 cwu.314.d:0 "\nSeeing the utter absurdness of such ultimatum, the Soviet Union has unilaterally rejected the ultimatum, calling it as a mere bluff by the Americans and expect that they wouldn't respond, for little Hungary is considered \"an acceptable loss\". However, fate seemed to change for the worst, as the United States took their ultimatum seriously, and have sent to their Congress the \"Authorization of Military Action against the Soviet Union Act\". The act calls for the direct, immediate military action of the United States against the Soviet Union for their horrific acts in Hungary, an act that has passed and signed into law mere hours after it was submitted to Congress. The effects of such act has already begun to manifest, with Berlin under siege by both forces, and American divisions swarming towards Berlin to secure supplies for its garrison. As of this moment, it is clear that we are in a 3rd World War, with humanity on the brink of collapse."

After contributing to the Allied war effort, the general sense of the political elite is that the South American behemoth was forgotten by it's allies in the north. While the US injected money in the economies of the losing powers, Brazil could not get approval for loans that didn't match the costs of the war effort and, worse, the regional strategic rival, Argentina, was being welcomed back in Washington despite having collaborated with the Nazi regime and housing war criminals who escaped from Germany. This combined with a lackluster administration by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, with instances of simple poor planning and management, the way was open for the return of the still popular former dictator and \"War President\" Getúlio Vargas."

 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

 stability.22.desc.a:0 "Production in several factories has slowed down dramatically over the last few days as the workers have declared a strike on all war production. Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
 stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Decisive action is needed."
 stability.23.desc.b:0 "Efforts to address the mutinies in the army have shown no effect. Emboldened by the lack of effective government response, the mutineers have expanded their list of demands to include an immediate cease-fire followed by a comprehensive peace treaty and demobilization.\n\nThe War Office strongly recommends that we send a strong signal to the mutineers to deter any further action on their part."

In several cases, street battles erupted between the police and the protesters, leading to a number of fatalities when the soldiers were forced to use their weapons to defend themselves. It took several hours until the police gained full control over the situation.\n\nAn ugly mood has settled over the capital as the barricades are cleared away and the dead are buried.

Higher pay and more frequent leave are often cited as the biggest new benefits, but many also point to the new government programs to support war widows and orphans. Fewer and fewer men can justify refusing their country's call to the colors, and public support for draft-dodgers has all but disappeared.\n\nIndeed, there has been a recent upswing in public support for the government as more and more people realize that the [ROOT.GetAdjective] way of life is under attack."

At dawn, military police raided the homes of a number of carefully selected, well known and connected people who have used their influence to allow others to avoid the draft. Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind. Recruitment stations across the country report that a growing number of people have come by to ask what exactly the consequences would be if a "friend" of theirs who had attempted to avoid the draft would turn themselves in."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this decision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work. It appears that even some cabinet members have second thoughts about the war - perhaps fearing for the safety of their own sons."

Claiming to be from a soldier who at first tried to avoid the draft, but then realized that he must fight to save his country, it has apparently struck a nerve with many others who felt similarly. Draft boards across the country report that the number of people who still refuse to answer their summons has been more than made up for by new volunteers who will no longer wait until they are called, while others go and fight to save their country and their way of life."

Given the grave situation we are in, the War Office has decided that these men be tried under military law for failing to report to duty.

Rather than bringing people back to the colors out of fear of the consequences, it has made those executed into instant martyrs for the peace movement. Their names and life stories have been published and very clearly edited to make them appear in the best possible light. Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war. The War Office reports that they have received a number of letters of draftees stating openly that they will not appear for duty - saying that they would not, under any circumstances, be party to another execution except as the person to be executed."

The raid was unsuccessful, however, as their plan was prematurely started due to an unlucky encounter by local police, followed by the quick response of the ROK Army.

The guards quickly eliminated the shooter. The shot was not deadly, but it required special treatment. Somoza was transported to the nearby Panama Canal to be operated. However, local anesthetic doctors did not take into account the special needs of an overweight and diabetic dictator, and Somoza fell into a coma during the operation. A couple of days later he died, transferring the power to his son."

Having been born in 1922, he experienced the rise of his father as the effective dictator of Nicaragua and took up the presidency following his assassination in 1956. Although he allowed elections and a new president in 1963, the real authority was still in the hands of him and his brother Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Despite foreign claims of rampant corruption and heavily restricted civil liberties, Somoza has ruled more lightly than his father and played a key role in the creation of a Central American single market. Following his death, there appeared to be great optimism throughout our country for a change in government and the Sandinista rebel organization has attracted a surge of popular support. However, Anastasio has taken up the presidency and, without any unexpected resistance, it appears that the Somoza dynasty will remain in power for the foreseeable future."

A state consisting of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria would be too large and independent to be controlled by Moscow.\n\nOf course these are just rumors and we cannot prove anything.

Therefore, elections were held only in 19 provinces, resulting in an additional 21 members of the House of Representatives from the existing 99 people. Of the total 3,518,276 eligible voters, there were 870,208 voters, representing 24.27%. The province with the most voting activity was Sakon nakonn Accounting for 45.12%, with Udon Thani having the least number of people voting, 12.02%.

 KPA_Coup.1.d:0 "We have received urgent news. Leading North Korean figures from the Soviet-Korean faction and the Yan'an faction, with support from the Soviet Union and China are attempting to overthrow Kim-Il Sung. Kim Il-sung became aware of the plan upon his return from Moscow and responded by delaying the plenum by almost a month and using the additional time to prepare by bribing and coercing Central Committee members and planning a stage-managed response. When the plenum finally opened Choe Chang-ik made a speech attacking Kim Il-sung for concentrating the power of the party and the state in his own hands as well as criticizing the party line on industrialization which ignored widespread starvation among the North Korean people. Yun Kong-hum attacked Kim Il-sung for creating a "police regime". Kim Il-sung's supporters heckled and berated the speakers rendering them almost inaudible and destroying their ability to persuade members. Kim Il-sung's supporters accused the opposition of being "anti-Party" and moved to expel Yun from the party. Kim Il-sung, in response, neutralized the attack on him by promising to inaugurate changes and moderate the regime. But is this enough for most? Or will Kim-Il be overthrown regardless?"

 prague_spring.1.d:0 "During the summer, the Union of Czechoslovakian Writers began publishing articles offering minor criticisms of the Party and slow rehabilitation of Czechoslovakian cultural figures. These criticisms reached a point where the most pro-communist journal, Literani Noviny, began advocating that literature should no longer have to confirm to party doctrine. However, this period of cautious expression for reform has been curtailed following a recent meeting of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia where senior leaders decided to administratively punish specific writers who advocated reform. The Party also placed several journals to be overseen by the Ministry of Culture. Although the Party has acted, many in the country, especially among the intellectual class are said to be growing increasingly unhappy with the Party and its approach to society."

 prague_spring.2.d:0 "President Antonin Novotny has ruled Czechoslovakia with an authoritarian streak since he became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC). However, in recent years President Novotny has faced increased criticism within the Party and among the people for his practices. To shore up his support, President Novotny asked Leonid Brezhnev to attend the latest Central Committee meeting in Prague. However, at this meeting, Alexander Dubcek, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Slovakia has led an effort to take over the position of First Secretary of the KSC. Brezhnev has been surprised at how many members of the KSC have turned on President Novotny and now the embattled President has asked for his opinion on the matter. Comrade Brezhnev must decide to either back the unpopular and weak President Novotny or give approval to the appointment of Dubcek as First Secretary, which may reunify the KSC and reduce public unrest."

These critics then tried to remove him as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC). However, to counter such a scenario, President Novotny had earlier called on the Soviet Secretary General, Leonid Brezhnev to attend the meeting to protect himself from such an effort and this tactic proved successful. Despite the strong effort to remove him, Brezhnev decided to back President Novotny and ended the attempt. President Novotny remains First Secretary of the KSC and Czechoslovakia remains under his control. However, many in the KSC and across the country are said to be upset with this interference from Moscow and although Novotny survived the challenge, he will have to deal with discontent both among the people and his party."

 prague_spring.5.d:0 "The appointment of Alexander Dubcek as First Secretary to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) saw President Antonin Novotny lose a lot of his political power in the country. Shortly after the appointment of Dubcek, Eduard Goldstucker became the chairman of the Union of Czechoslovakian Writers and editor in chief of the leading journal, Literani Noviny. Goldstucker recently challenged state censorship policies by openly criticizing the policies of President Novotny in a nationally televised interview. President Novotny and his supporters have called on Dubcek to enforce censorship laws and punish Goldstucker. However, others in the party have urged Dubcek to allow these criticisms and support an atmosphere of openness to the people. They believe harshly enforcing censorship laws will only alienate the people."

Indeed, the support for reform and openness has seen public rallies emerge across the country in support of First Secretary Alexander Dubcek. Now Dubcek must decide if he will begin the process to abolish the strict censorship laws or roll back the public mood by cracking down on these public rallies and publications. Announcing the intention to end censorship laws will garner Dubcek greater public support, allow him to bring more reform policies to the people and strengthen his supporters in the party. However, to instead crackdown on this new openness will alienate the population and his own party supporters, but it would likely assuage concerns from Moscow and among party hardliners."

For Novotny and other hardliners within the KSC, the opening of political space and media along with other reforms threatens to destroy Party unity and the communist order in Czechoslovakia. Dubcek subsequently offered General Ludvik Svoboda the Presidency and he accepted. President Svoboda announced he would support the reform efforts and his appointment is being lauded across the country due to his highly decorated military career. Politically, President Svoboda survived post-war purges and is seen as a national hero among Czechs and Slovaks."

The Program envisions a gradual liberalization of Czechoslovakia by increasing freedom of press, speech, movement. Economic reform is also being discussed along with an acceptance that multiparty politics may eventually return to the country. Dubcek noted the previous communist policies were not flawed as they were necessary to end the bourgeois influence and post-war instability. Now, Dubcek and reformers believe a socialist society with a positive relationship with the state is the main objective of the Action Program. Although Dubcek did not criticize communism and stated he would work with fellow communist parties, Moscow is said to be viewing these developments with much suspicion.

Under his stewardship he has overseen a liberalization of Czechoslovakian society through his reformist Action Program. Although he has tried hard to emphasize the policy as a natural continuation of communist ideology, many in Moscow and across the communist world find the opening of society as a major threat. They are especially concerned with Dubcek tolerating debates regarding the re-establishment of non-communist parties in the country. Soviet leadership emphasized these concerns to Dubcek and after a tense series of meetings, Dubcek returned to Prague. Although Dubcek stated the visit as an exchange of ideas, it is clear ties between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union is strained and the Soviets will be watching events closely."

Today, the process of abolishing censorship laws has been officially completed and the government announced the end of censorship in Czechoslovakia. The government was quick to note the abolishment of censorship did not mean anarchy, but a confirmation of the communist development society had undergone. The government does not expect people to discuss disruptive ideas or challenge the continued development of the state by the party.

It did not call for a revolution but a more democratization of society under the KSC. Controversially it also advocated an acceleration to liberalization and the re-establishment of pre-revolution socialist parties. The manifesto has angered the conservative KSC base who claim the document is a consequence to the Action Program of First Secretary Alexander Dubcek.

Newspapers in Prague noted the military deployment lacked any participation from Czechoslovakian forces and are occurring before scheduled talks between the Czechoslovakian and Soviet government over the recent liberal reforms. Many citizens have grown concerned that the exercises are a dress rehearsal to a Soviet intervention and state the government should prepare to resist. However, the Czechoslovakian government has given no indication it will begin any military response and, in a statement, reiterated its bond with the Soviet Union and its allies. In addition, Soviet military officers have also been visiting in larger numbers. The Soviet military visits are also seen as an effort by the Soviets to prepare and scout in case of an intervention."

They noted liberalization has led to a growing movement demanding multiparty elections and anarchy. They suggest if order is not restored than communism itself may collapse in the streets of Prague. However, the Czechoslovakian leaders noted the popularity of their programs and the strengthening of party popularity among the people. Instead of capitulating to Soviet demands, they instead suggested the Soviets treat them as a model to reform the party and rejuvenate support for communism.

The dangerous reforms in Czechoslovakia are reaching anarchic levels and the communist party there is on the verge of losing control.

This decision has now ended the liberalization of media and public assembly which had galvanized the people of Prague over the last few months.

He will be replaced by the hardline communist Gustav Husak who enjoys the blessings of Moscow.

Bramsnæs and Karl Kristian Steincke.\nPer Albin Hansson introduced the concept in 1928 saying that Sweden should become more like a \"good home\", this being marked by equality and mutual understanding. Hansson advocated that the traditional class society should then be replaced by folkhemmet. This concept came to include free and high quality education at all levels, free universal healthcare and many other social benefits."

More ideologically moderate than most of his comrades, Ouédraogo did not command much popular support and governed the country amid an unstable political climate. After prolonged dispute with Prime Minister Thomas Sankara culminated to purging of the several radicals, Ouedraogo was deposed in a coup led by Captain Blaise Compaoré, who made his close friend Sankara President. Sankara has promised to begin a period of societal transformation of the state."
brk.2.d:0 "A pro-Libyan paratroop captain who was dismissed as Prime Minister of Upper Volta in May seized power in the West African country today in a coup that reportedly left 13 people dead and 15 wounded. Diplomats in Upper Volta said 6 of the wounded were French nationals.\nThe captain, Thomas Sankara, 35 years old, went on national radio to announce the ouster of the Government of President Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo. It was the third coup in Upper Volta in three years and took place one year before a promised return to civilian rule.\nCaptain Sankara was described as ''a committed Marxist-Leninist'' and is said to be particularly popular among young Upper Voltans. He became a national hero in 1974 by leading a raid into Mali during a brief border war in that year."

Initially favoured by the trade unions and much of the political opposition, he soon made them his enemies. Establishing a junta with many radical members, Zerbo's leadership grew increasingly dictatorial. He re-banned all political parties, and once more made labour strikes illegal.\nAnti-Zerbo protests grew increasingly frequent, with anti-government strikes taking place in April, the trade unions demanding a return to constitutional government in May, and several prominent union and opposition leaders arrested in September.\nNow the progressive and radical factions within the military regime have had enough with Zerbo.In the capital, the army chief of staff Colonel Gabriel Yoryan Somé and other officers calling themselves the Council of Popular Salvation moved to depose and arrest Zerbo. Zerbo was declared a lying demagogue who had betrayed the confidence of his people.\nTwo days after the coup, the little-known army physician Major Dr. Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo was named head of state by the new junta."
brk.4.d:0 "Sangoulé Lamizana has ruled Upper Volta since his coup against Maurice Yaméogo in 1966. Lamizana would go on to rule the country as a military dictator until the Upper Voltan presidential election in 1978, when he was elected as the leader of a civilian regime. During the 1970s, the Lamizana government faced many problems, among them continued opposition from the trade unions, the rise of new political opposition groups, a strong Sahel drought, increasing desertification, and so on. The need for foreign aid reached record levels, in 1979 making up a full 70% of the government budget.\nIn February 1979 the major trade unions launched a new anti-Lamizana campaign. In May, two prominent labour leaders were arrested for inciting revolt. Two months later, Lamizana denounced the unionist demands, calling for national unity. By December, the president finally acknowledges the country's dependence on Western aid for survival.\nSoon after, Colonel Saye Zerbo led a military coup d'état, overthrowing President Lamizana. The coup proved both bloodless and successful. The riot police, deployed against the striking workers, attempted a counter-coup in support of Lamizana, but failed to reinstate him. Zerbo - a military veteran, former Minister of Foreign Affairs 1974-1976, commander of the army regiment in the capital Ouagadougou, and head of military intelligence - suspended the constitution, and established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress, a 31-member junta. Several members of the junta were young and radical, among them future presidents Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaoré. Among the parts of society that supported the coup were the Mossi people and the Upper Voltan Catholics, two groups sidelined by Lamizana, although Zerbo like his predecessor was a Bissa Muslim."
brk.5.d:0 "We achieved our independence in 1960. Maurice Yaméogo created a single-party dictatorship, making his own Voltaic Democratic Union the sole legal political party in the country. Opposition parties, like the African Regroupment Party, were either merged with it or dissolved.\nYaméogo's government would come to face charges of neocolonialism, as it aligned closely with the French government. The President's harsh policies, and deeply corrupt state of his administration, made him hugely impopular. In 1964, the government strongly restricted the right of workers to organize and outlawed labour strikes, making the strong trade unions its enemies. In the presidential election the following year Yaméogo was re-elected, with a supposed 100% support and 98.4% turnout. The parliamentary election the following day officially saw a 100% support and 97.4% turnout in favour of the Voltaic Democratic Union, but in fact mass abstention in protest against the President and his party took place.\n\nOn 30 December, following increased economic troubles, the government announced a new austerity budget, massively cutting the salaries of public sector employees and raising taxes. The following day, Denis Yaméogo – Minister of the Interior and Security, and the President's half-brother - used heavy-handed force to break up a meeting of the national labour leadership. As a result, a general strike was called. On 1 January 1966 President Yaméogo declared a state of emergency in the country. On 2 January he deployed troops to all public buildings, and warned government employees against participating in the general strike. Finally, on 3 January, the general strike began. Large groups of protesting workers stormed the ruling party headquarters and the National Assembly. The state of emergency and troop deployments backfired on the government - the rank and file soldiers refused to shoot protesters. Within short, the military leadership stepped in. Lieutenant Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana, the Chief of Staff, seized power. President Maurice Yaméogo was forced to resign, and was later imprisoned. The following day a new military government was organized, which received the support of the trade unions which ended the general strike. The constitution was suspended and the National Assembly dissolved. A new cabinet was formed with seven military officials and four civilians, the Superior Council of the Armed Forces, with Lamizana at the helm. A Consultative Committee was also formed, with 46 members representing the military, political parties, trade unions, religious leaders, and traditional authorities."

While religion of any kind is still technically legal, practicing in public, spreading of any kind, or owning texts deemed “holy” by the communist party are illegal and punishable by up to five years in forced labor. This policy and many like it have chocked off both the spread and appeal to religion of any kind, and it is likely that by the end of the decade, Malaysia will be a completely atheistic state."
MLA.11.d:0 "Comrades, after our brave resistance against Japanese fascism, our colonial overlords have returned to this land. As we speak, English dogs pillage our countryside, starve our people, and exploit our nation. With every passing day, the fruits of our labor are stolen and used to entrench colonial rule. This is our last chance to throw the British into the sea. If we fail, our proud people will remain in shackles, but shall we succeed, all of Malaysia will be free from starvation, fear, and tyranny."
MLA.12.d:0 "Today is a proud day for the workers of Malaysia. We have expelled the British from Malaysia! However, our colonial rulers have a final fight left in them. Intel suggests that the crown colony of Singapore has recently experienced an influx of enemy troops. If we allow this small Island to receive any more reinforcements, British and American forces will be able to launch large offensives into our country. For that reason, Chairman Peng has ordered the Island taken and the red flag be raised over the city as soon as possible."
MLA.15.d:0 "Comrade Shamsiah Fakeh, hero of the Anti-British war and Propaganda Minister has written to Chairman Peng advising dramatic reorganization of the Malaysian Communist Party. Instead of a pro-chinese government with Chin Peng at the helm, Fakeh has recommended a neutral collective leadership with him as a figurehead. She argues that with a collective leadership, the Malaysian Communist Party can more effectively bridge the gap between ethnic and religious groups as well as seek close ties with both Moscow and Beijing."
MLA.16.d:0 "The Anti-British War has nearly broken the rural peasantry. The Colonial deportation and chemical bombing campaigns have destroyed Malaysia's ability to feed its hungry proletariat. We must act fast to decontaminate the farms and repatriate the skilled farmers."
MLA.24.d:0 "With our power secured, it is now time to rebuild our great nation from the ground up. During there cowardly retreat, British and Colonial troops destroyed every economic asset they could touch in an attempt to sabotage our reconstruction. Because of this, we must build Malaysia from the ground up. Farms must be decontaminated, factories must be restored, and the people must be educated. We have a lot of work ahead of us comrades, but with faith in Chairman Peng, anything is possible!"
MLA.25.d:0 "Recent census data has shown that the education level in Malaysia is far worse than we could have ever imagined. While we have no concrete data, it is likely the literacy rate in our new nation is under 30%. If we wish to rebuild and modernize, the peasants must be educated."
MLA.26.d:0 "After sorting through the rubble of our newly liberated nation, we have discovered that most of our industry has been lost. It is our duty to salvage any possible equipment, schematics, and technical expertise left behind to hopefully patch together some form of an industrial base."
MLA.27.d:0 "Individual towns and cities have reported their mortality rates since we came to power and the numbers are horrifying. We can report with absolute certainty that approximately one and a half million people (out of a population of around 7.5 million) have perished from work related accidents, starvation, disease, and neglect. Chairman Peng, previously offering Buddhist teachings when presented with warnings has been hospitalized in Beijing after an attempted suicide. His exact state is unknown, but it is likely he will make a full recovery."
MLA.19.d:0 "For the first time in a month, Comrade Peng has emerged from the hospital to address the central committee. In a surprising move, Peng denounced his faith in Buddhism and vowed to take revenge on teachings which he believes blinded him to the suffering in our great nation. Peng proposed a 6 phase plan to cleanse Malaysia of the “great lie”."
MLA.4.d:0 "Today, the Dalai Lama left his home in Tibet to tour the new communist state in Malaysia. The leader of the Buddhist world was greeted with a large parade in the nations capital featuring Buddhist imagery and military strength. In an interview, the Dalai Lama praise for the new state and its Buddhist leader Chin Peng for delivering peace and prosperity to all people of Malaysia. Although invited to stay in Malaysia permanently, the Dalai Lama stated that while the new Malaysian state will forever hold a place in his heart, his true home is Tibet."
MLA.14.d:0 "During the chaotic retreat from our land, many British bomber pilots were captured. These bomber pilots have been convicted of crimes against humanity by the Malaysian National Court. All that awaits is a sentence. Many believe the only just action is death by firing squad. These pilots are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and death may be the only just punishment. Others, however, believe the best punishment is to send the pilots to the victims of British bombings and force them to repair the damage they caused. This could eventually teach them a lesson and hopefully turn them into loyal party members. Finally, a growing number of citizens believe our country has seen enough death. Killing these boys won't bring anyone back and the best course of action is to heal the wounds of war. What should be done?"
MLA.13.d:0 "Tunku Abdul Rahman, a collaborator to both the British colonial government and the Empire of Japan has been captured. The snake has been tried by the Malaysian National Court and has been convicted with treason. Now we must sentence him. Many argue the death penalty is required, some believe hard labor is the option, and a few think prosecutions is a waste of time and will only polarize the nation further. What should be done?"
MLA.20.d:0 "Under special order: 897 all religious institutions are to be demolished with any artifacts inside. The rubble must be cleared in a timely manner and the foundation will be covered with gardens, parks, and apartment complexes. Any persons attempting to resist will be imprisoned for a maximum sentence of five years. Any person attempting to harm a member or members of a demolition team will be shot on site."
MLA.5.d:0 "Disturbing news has come out of Malaysia today. Reports have been verified that colonial landlords left behind by retreating British forces are now being liquidated. While the exact number is unknown, it is estimated that over 150 to 200 landlords have been executed by the state in methods ranging from hangings, to firing squads, to even public stoning. The Malaysian government has stated that “although executions bring us no joy, we cannot allow crimes against the Malaysian people to go unpunished”. Already, it appears executions are winding down, yet this is likely to remain a black spot on the Peoples Democratic Republic of Malaysia."
MLA.28.d:0 "Today, former hero of the Anti-British war in Malaysia Shamsiah Fakeh was publicly executed on charges of treason. Since the communist state was founded, Fakeh petitioned hard to maintain good relations with both the Soviets and Red Chinese by organizing a pluralistic socialist government. However, as relations soured between the nations, Fakehs utopian sense of unity and compromise became a liability to the increasingly Maoist party. Late last night, a kangaroo court was organized and in a rare televised event, Shamsiah Fakeh was sentenced to death by firing squad. The execution was followed by Chairman Chin Peng stating that effective immediately, the MCP (Malaysian Communist Party) would no longer tolerate “reactionary deviation in the proletarian revolution” within its ranks."
MLA.29.d:0 "Last week, confused citizens across Thailand awoke to find trillions of banknotes covering the nation. While initially treated as a blessing by the impoverished Thai people, the drastic increase in currency has almost overnight caused the value of the Thai Baht to plummet to historic lows. While long-term damages are unknown, shops across the nation are empty, most of the workforce have abandoned their posts due to stagnant wages, and Pathet Lao splinters have flared up in across the countryside. In an official statement, the Thai government has accused the Peoples Democratic Republic of Malaysia of sabotaging their economy and have called on strict UN sanctions."
MLA.30.d:0 "Today marks a new era for the people of Malaysia as Chairman Peng announced the completion of the S.A. Ganapathy Railway Network. Cutting through jungles, mountains, and rivers, the 5,000-mile railway network connects all major cities, ports, mines, and logging areas to Chin Peng City. As well as new access to rare resources, the infrastructure allows much needed aid and supplies to reach remote villages. For the first time, the people of Malaysia can commute to work like westerners as the communist state continues to modernize."
MLA.31.d:0 "A new movement has risen from the jungles of southern Thailand. Today members of the CPT (Communist Party Thailand) led by lieutenant colonel Phayom Chulanont, along with Pathet Lao splinters and Chinese nationalists, made a long marched across the nation and declared an independent region around the small city of Hat Yai on the Malaysian border. The group, referring to themselves as the Tàiguó mínzú (Thai Nation), is a Maoist insurgency group dedicated to the liberation of all Thai people. While the Royal Thai Armed Forces have been mobilized, probing attacks on the Malaysian Supported guerrillas have ended in disaster leading many to believe this new statelet is here to stay."
MLA.32.d:0 "In the wake of growing Sino-Soviet tension, Chairman Mao has urged us to disband our dual leadership system, execute Shamsiah Fakeh, and officially join the struggle against Soviet Cultural Imperialism. While Chin Peng has grown hostile to Khrushchevs interventions in Eastern Europe, Fakehs policy of socialist neutrality has brought the wealth of both China and the Soviet Union into Malaysian ports. Advisers have also informed us that socialist neutrality can still be kept, so long as take extra care in future international relations."
MLA.33.d:0 "Chairman Peng has announced to us his intentions in modernizing Malaysia. Although many wishes to accomplish this task alone, few can deny the need for outside funding. Luckily, two plans have been given to us. The first one is from the USSR. The Soviet Government has promised us full access to industrial secrets as well as extremely generous trade deals on soviet resources. All they wish for in return is a 50-year lease on the port of Malacca to simplify trade in the region. The second one is from the PRC. Comrade Mao has offered top industrial advisers, as well as half a million of China’s best workers to help us modernize. All they ask in return is our full support in diplomatic affairs. While both are tempting, we can only choose one offer."
MLA.34.d:0 "The time has come. Plans for every aspect of the modernization campaign are complete, millions of our workers are mobilized, and supplies from our allies pour through our ports. All that remains now is to give the go-ahead."
MLA.35.d:0 "While the mass literacy initiative brought reading and wisdom to our nation, it has become necessary to expand the Malaysian peoples knowledge further. Chairman Peng has requested that by 1975, all Malaysian people have a college degree. To fulfill this request, universities covering topics ranging from mathematics to applied engineering must be founded, a new enthusiasm for learning must be cultivated, and our understanding of language must be increased."
MLA.38.d:0 "Through British imperialism, Japanese occupation, and famine, our people have persevered. It is time for the communist party reward them. Every citizen in our nation has access to clean water, a dry bed, and safety from violence, yet they require more. Consumer shops are frequently empty, the lines to receive medical aid often stretch around whole blocks, and our workers lack goods to spend rising wages on. These must be fixed if we are to be considered a modern nation."
MLA.36.d:0 "Currently, the average Malaysian citizen relies on only 1,250 calories per day. While technically “safe”, any breakdown in productivity will send Malaysia into another famine. If we are to sustain our growing industrial base, all agriculture bottlenecks must be eliminated, mechanization must be achieved, an increase in fertilizer production must happen."
MLA.39.d:0 "With our country stabilized, we can now begin to exploit our nations rich resources. The mines from british colonial rule can now be re-opened and miners can get back to work. Prospectors returning from Perak and Terengganu have found large deposits of iron, copper, and bauxite. We must harness these riches for the benefit and progress of all Malaysians."
MLA.40.d:0 "With our great nation modernized, we can begin efforts to liberate all of Southeast Asia. To aid our struggle, the Mǎláixīyà Qíngbào Jú (Malaysian Intelligence Agency) has been founded to gather intel, assist in revolutionary activity, and if necessary, join in direct combat with reactionary forces across the region."
MLA.41.d:0 "For almost twenty years the Burmese civil war has remained stagnant. The white flag faction under comrade Thakin Than Tun is in a constant state of crisis, yet the Burmese government is unable to strike a critical blow. It is in both the Chinese and our own strategic interests to see these revolutionaries succeed and establish an allied state. Victory here will mean the total encirclement of Thailand as well as a gateway to Bangladesh and India."
MLA.42.d:0 "Since the early 50s, the Pathet Lao have been in a state of conflict with the French, Americans, and kingdom of Laos. It is in the interests of both the Lao proletariat and our great nation to see a Socialist government in Laos. For that reason, we must begin sending weapons and equipment to increase their chances of victory."
MLA.43.d:0 "Operatives from our Thailand have reported a situation ripe for revolution. Although currently a small force, the CPT (Communist Party Thailand) has access and connections to many leftist and nationalist guerilla groups in the region. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the Royal Thai Armed Forces contain Maoist sympathies. If given firm direction, these groups can coordinate in one combined fist capable of shattering the reactionary Monarchy. If given enough attention, funding, and supplies, we believe that by 1980, an allied socialist state can be established in Thailand."
MLA.44.d:0 "The situation in Cambodia is... Interesting. The Maoist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot currently wage a bloody guerilla war against the Cambodian monarchy. While on paper, we support Pol Pots struggle against Cambodian repression, operatives and specialists in the MQJ seriously question Pol Pots ability and intelligence to lead his nation in peace time. We believe, however, that given intellect and precarious situation, Pol Pot could prove to be a valuable puppet to us."
MLA.45.d:0 "Intel suggests the situation in South Vietnam is misleading. American troops pour into the reactionary Diem regime, yet it is clear the will of both their peoples are breaking. Propaganda, repressions, and forced conscription have only emboldened the south Vietnamese proletariat in taking up arms against imperialism. However, to think victory is assured in Vietnam is foolish. Battle lines shift every day and one offensive can destroy all progress in the region. For this reason, we believe it is our duty to get involved in the conflict."
MLA.46.d:0 "Although initial relief programs have been successful, our industrial base and manpower alone will be unable to tip the balance of the Burmese civil war alone. For this reason, we must request additional Chinese involvement."
MLA.47.d:0 "Comrade Peng has come to us with an enticing proposal. For the last several months, our Malaysian comrades have become increasingly invested in the conflict in Burma. Although our southern comrades have great amounts of luck, they require more materials and commitment from our great nation. While Many are concerned about getting bogged down in Burma, Peng has expressed the strategic importance of an allied state in the region. What should we do?"
MLA.48.d:0 "Excellent news from the Peoples Republic of China. As we speak, the Chinese economy is preparing for prolonged involvement in the Burmese Civil war. They have outlined their goal to send fifty transport planes carrying weapons, advisors, and workers each day for the next ten months. This increased Chinese aid will almost certainly secure victory in the civil war."
MLA.49.d:0 "Disappointing news from the Peoples Republic of China. While Comrade Mao and the CCP empathize with Burmese struggle, they have refused any involvement for the foreseeable future on the grounds of wanting to avoid a Vietnam scenario.  While this news is a setback to progress in the civil war, our comrades in Burma still have hope in securing victory."

While foreign eyes have been banned from the nation, defectors speak of unfinished broken factories, destroyed rail lines, starvation, and repression unseen since the days of Japanese occupation. Not much is known about the tiny communist nation yet many believe Chairman Pengs ambitious modernization campaign has failed. There are many predicted reasons for complete economic collapse however the biggest one appears to be a rushed industrial base and poor steel manufacturing leading to a breakdown in the nations' agriculture infrastructure. Many nations in the UN have offered grain shipments however no response has come from Malaysia."
MLA.58.d:0 "Today, the Communists achieved a major victory in Asia. The long-time ally of the west Thailand has officially fallen to communist guerrillas. In the days after the Royalist defeat, the Peoples Republic of Thailand was founded under a strict Maoist one party state. This development came as a shock on both sides of the iron curtain and many have already stated the failure of US containment as Communism sweeps across Asia. In a rare interview with Chairman Chulanon, the revolutionary states he hopes to “prove The Domino Theory correct” as the Thai Peoples Liberation Army Begins mobilizing on reactionary borders."

While the direct whereabouts of Peng are unknown, most analysts believe the new group in charge, coined the reformist faction, is here to stay.

As of now, the future of Malaysia is unknown as the country moves forward into a new decade."

While the two nations have had icy relations in the past, the leaders of both nations believe it is time to halt hostilities and begin sewing the seeds of peace. The outcomes of this summit include an end to harsh sanctions, the return of POWs, and a guarantee of non-aggression by both parties. While the reaction of the international community has been mostly positive, Albania, the DPRK, and most notably the PRC have harshly criticized the summit and everything it stands for. Despite these condemnations, many agree this is a major step forward in the struggle for global peace."

MLA.68.d:0 "A toast to the Malaysian proletariat. With our nation modernized, our people enjoy luxuries never before imagined. Indoor pluming, consistent access to clean water and electricity, fully paved roads, and accessible medical treatment are but a few of the many gifts the CPM has awarded to our loyal working class. Yet, a problem remains. Our impressive growth has caused prices on virtually every good to plummet. While this may appear to be a major victory for our great nation, we failed to adjust the money supply in accordance with these new price changes. Because of this failure, mass shortages grip the nation. We must quickly fix this mistake before we risk loosing everything."
MLA.69.d:0 "The Ministry of Internal security has come to us with troubling news.

MQJ has encouraged utilizing terror tactics against reactionary occupiers while arming anti-government groups in preparation for any action taken. With good leadership, patience, and luck, we may finally be able to fully liberate our full nation."

While the true intentions of Vostok-62 are unknown, it is widely believed the goal has been to simulate a multinational assault through poorly supplied territory. Although initially troubled with systemic organization issues and many instances of miscommunication, commanders on the ground were quick to re-establish order and drive forward. Standout moments from the exercise included a failed joint Soviet-Korean drop over Yili that resulted in an estimated 22 casualties and the surprising effectiveness of a joint East German-Chinese assault across Lake Zaysan."

BUL.15.d:0 "There is growing disconnection between the BCP and the youth. We must find a way to inspire more political participation for the survival of the party and working class of Bulgaria. Many reformists in the Septemberists believe we must expand leisure activities in the Pioneers. Suggestions such as mass imports of East German “Kinderpanzers”, yearly camping trips to Siberia, and summer camps have all been embraced by the reformist faction of the Septemberists. On the opposite end of the spectrum, hardline Chervnenkovists have called for a more forceful hand. They believe that to keep up youth participation in the BCP, unnecessary decadent bells and whistles must be removed and minor conscription introduced. This plan, if implemented correctly, will greatly expand the BCP and ensure youth discipline for the   future. Both options have strengths and weaknesses, and we must choose one before the youth is alienated for good."

Some believe we must continue with Chervnenkovist economic policy, while others believe liberalization is needed to keep pace with the rest of Europe. Chervnenkovists have argued that relaxing heavy industry now will foster complacency in the proletarian masses of Bulgaria. Abstinence from decedent consumerism in their eyes will bring about the conditions for communism. Opposing them are reformist socialist planners who believe that without the technology and comforts of a modern nation, the Bulgarian workers will grow tired of the communist project and abandon it entirely. There is no clear answer to this split in our ranks and any answer could result in absolute failure or success."

This announcement has brought condemnation from many countries who worry about complete agricultural collapse. Despite the concerns, the entire Bulgarian population has already been mobilized and deployed to the countryside to rapidly accelerate industrialization."
BUL.28.d:0 "Today, Todor Zhivkov announced a controversial decision to begin undoing the nations many laws against homosexuality. This decision came after 26 men were arrested for “deviant behavior”. However, the courts were swayed by their story and, in a shocking development, ruled them innocent. Soon after, homosexuality was decriminalized, and civil unions have now been recognized under Bulgarian law. Many have criticized this development, the most outspoken group being the Orthodox church who has, in a rare instance, gone against party line. Despite the pushback, many are happy for this positive development in Bulgarian culture."
BUL.29.d:0 "Last night, Bulgarian officers commanded by Ivan Gorunya staged a coup and toppled premier Zhivkov. Gorunya has announced the end of the Zhivkov regime and the beginning of a new Hardline era for Bulgaria. The Soviets were quick to condemn the coup and have requested the new government step down and release Zhivkov and his family unharmed. These demands are unlikely to be met as Bulgarian troops oust Soviet garrisons around the country. Already, the Warsaw Pact has been put on high alert and rumors circulate of a possible intervention. The new Bulgarian government has warned that any incursion onto its soil will result in all-out peoples war."
BUL.30.d:0 "Last night, treasonous officers of the Sofia garrison attempted to opportunistically take power from our peoples’ government. The coup, however, was known to Internal security for months and every officer was arrested before damage could be done. Ivan Gorunya, the leader of the coup, has been detained and is currently being interrogated. This coup has failed spectacularly, however another one could be upon us soon. For that reason, we must crack down hard on the military to ensure the safety of our peoples' democracy."
BUL.31.d:0 "Over the past month, KGB agents stationed in Bulgaria have noticed a rise in Uranium extraction. While it is possible that the rogue state is constructing power plants, we believe it is more likely that the Peoples Republic of Bulgaria is attempting to create a nuclear device. Many in the ranks of the Red Army have urged us to intervene before Bulgaria acquires nuclear weapons. The KGB however has warned that there is a possibility that Bulgaria already possesses a nuclear device and may use it on advancing Warsaw Pact troops. We must decide on a response quickly before it's too late"
BUL.31.d:0 "Today, Warsaw Pact troops crossed the Bulgarian border in an attempt to bring Bulgaria back into the Soviet bloc. Because of open Romanian hostility to other pact troops, the invasion had to come from the Black Sea. Soviet and East German marines with Hungarian and Polish support landed in Varna and Burgas, while Czechoslovak troops established a beachhead in Sozople. The combined armies of the Warsaw Pact initially met stiff resistance on the outskirts of Sliven however after a series of flanking maneuvers the Bulgarian Peoples Army melted away and Sofia was breached after only 3 days. The Bulgarian government has been apprehended and are currently awaiting trial. So far, the west has been silent on the issue, and it is unlikely there will be any official statements."
