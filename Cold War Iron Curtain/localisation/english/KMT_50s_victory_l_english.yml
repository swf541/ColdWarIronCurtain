VICTORY_POINTS_3893:0 "Edirine"
CHI_KMT.0.d:0 "The Temporary Provisions, passed to aid the government in defeating the communist rebellion, were recently amended. The first set of Temporary Provisions were enacted to suspend certain political and civil liberties in order to enhance the state in its operations against the communists and prevent communist infiltration. With the front stabilized for the moment, the National Assembly voted to amend the Temporary Provisions, expanding their expiration date and adapting its powers to better suit the current situation. With the new provisions, President [CHI.GetLeader] can now more effectively re-establish state authority in restored territories and uproot any communist fifth columnists."
CHI_KMT.1.d:0 "The KMT stands at a crossroads. In recent years it survived a war with Japan and a massive communist resurgence that nearly overthrew the regime. Many in the party are now saying the moment is right to initiate reforms and change the course of the party. They blame martial law, centralization, and authoritarian tactics as the reason why Japan and the communists were able to thrive. More democratization and liberties will strengthen the state and ensure any hostile ideology or force is unable to thrive in the republic. However, there are headliners in the party who disagree and argue it was only through centralization and martial law that the republic was strong enough to defeat the threats. They argue China must continue on this path in order to complete its independence and unification. President [CHI.GetLeader] must decide on reform or staying the path."
CHI_TIB.0.d:0 "The Dalai Lama declared his independence and has governed Tibet since 1912. The Republic of China in the past has generously offered the Dalai Lama his historical titles and apologized for any excesses during the Qing period, however, he refuses to engage with us. We maintain the sovereignty of Tibet is Chinese, but the Dalai Lama continues to deny this and has negotiated territory way in the past without our permission. The time is right for us to force a resolution on Tibet and decide once and for all its relationship with the republic."
KMT_MIL.1.d:0 "A group of senior officers submitted their report on the fighting abilities, logistics, and organization of the National Revolutionary Army. The report highlights the grievances of soldiers in regards to poor logistical support and uneven pay schedules. It also pointed out issues related to poor leadership among officers and inadequate training for soldiers. Without reforms, the National Revolutionary Army risks further decline. The current structure also encourages the organization of cliques and territorialism and this must be reformed as well. The national leadership has decided to act on the report and will initiate a series of reforms to address these issues and strengthen the national defense."
KMT_NUCLEAR.1.d:0 "President [CHI.GetLeader] oversaw the opening of the new Institute of Nuclear Energy Research. This marks a new focus for the government on the potential of nuclear technology. The Chinese government hopes nuclear energy could play a major role in meeting future energy demands as all of China advances. However, the institute will also consider the private development of nuclear weapons. The question will be whether China seeks to develop such weapons on its own or by asking the Americans for help. If developed on our own, we would be in complete control of such weapons but it may take a long time. Bringing the Americans would accelerate the development but limit our independence and ability to gear the program to our situation. We must decide which route to take as the communists are no doubt developing their own bomb."
CHI_INDO.0.d:0 "During the last war the Japanese seized Indochina from the French and established a brutal regime. However, the Vietnamese resistance tenaciously fought first the French and then the Japanese, often using China as their main base. At the end of the war, China occupied northern Vietnam until the French returned. France now seeks to reestablish its prewar colonial but are now facing an uprising by the Viet Quoc. We have strong ties with Vietnam and many of its factions use our land as bases or supply hubs. We must decide to either back the French, to ensure no communist Vietnamese faction becomes dominant, or support the anti-French Vietnamese nationalists and push for the non-communists to triumph."
CHI_BANDIT.0.d:0 "The chaos of war and civil war has left the countryside and isolated towns the victims of bandits. Many are military units which disserted or armed militias ravaging the countryside. These bandits commit unspeakable crimes on travelers and raid goods moving along the roads. The KMT government will have to address this crisis in order to restart internal trade and better unify the country. For many peasants, it is the local warlords they look to for protection from the bandits, not the government. If the bandit problem is not addressed, popular support and the economy will rapidly erode."
CHI_VIN.0.d:0 "As part of our policy of backing the anti-colonial Viet Quoc, our intelligence agents have begun quietly assassinating Viet Minh officers. The communist Viet Minh are another major anti-colonial Vietnamese party and they compete with the Viet Quoc for legitimacy and recruitment. Removing their officers will hinder their ability to recruit more fighters or establish organized bands of fighters. The Viet Quoc should be able to better recruit and present themselves as a true party for the independence of Vietnam. The Viet Minh do not appear to be aware of our involvement in the killings."
CHI_VIN.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, a number of our officers have been assassinated, mostly in our bases along the Chinese border. Investigations are ongoing but the likely culprits appear to be either the French, the Chinese, or the Viet Quoc. The French view us as the primary threat but are not as established in the region. The Chinese are virulently anti-communist but are supporting the anti-colonial cause. The Viet Quoc claim to be our comrades and wish to fight together against the French but seem incapable of such sophisticated operations. Regardless, removing our officers weakens our recruitment and combat effectiveness. We will have to monitor the situation closely."
KMT_LAND_REFORM.0.d:0 "One of the biggest issues facing the Republic of China, since its earliest days, has been the issue of land reform. The perceived failure to break the power of landowners and provide opportunities for peasants has long been blamed on peasant unrest and communist popularity. The failure to institute a sweeping land reform is also blamed for lackluster economic development as China continues to not reach its true agricultural capacity. However, landlords offer political and financial support for the government and breaking their power may risk empowering those groups who often oppose the KMT. The government must decide to either initiate a full-scale land reform to rectify the problem, or offer a more modest reform plan in order to provide peasant relief while also not alienating the powerful landlord classes."
KMT_REFORM.1.d:0 "A new Central Reform Committee has been established to better direct the future political developments of the republic and reform the KMT. The new committee will avoid the ineptness and corruption of previous executive committees by encouraging educated, young, highly motivated party members to lead the effort and revitalize the party. It is unknown which faction of the party will dominate the committee and the republic. Chiang Kai-Shek is a proven leader, promising to continue his hardline approach of centralizing the state and suppressing political dissent. Li Zongren, a military commander and rival of Chiang offers a more democratic vision for China with more civil liberties. The famed General Sun Li-jen believes in extensive party reforms and orientating the foreign policy and state structures to the United States."
TIBET_KMT.100.d:0 "The Republic of China recognizes the Panchen Lama, seen as spiritually second only to the Dalai Lama, is increasingly seeking a more prominent political role. The Panchen Lama is said to command his own loyal military forces and is looking for outside help. The Chinese government is willing to offer his forces arms, training, and funds on the condition that in the event the Dalai Lama refuses to accept Chinese sovereignty, he will act. This puts the Dalai Lama in a difficult position as it is now clear that he risks a potential uprising or coup if he does not follow the dictates of China."
TIBET_KMT.4.d:0 "The Republic of China has requested we accept their sovereignty over our lands. The Chinese promise they would respect our current government and administration but wish to oversee our foreign policy and defense. If we do not accept this demand, we risk some overt or covert attempt to change our mind. But we would have a chance to maintain our independence. If we do accept, we will maintain a degree of autonomy and freedom of action, however, overtime, the Chinese may seek to directly occupy Tibet."
TIBET_KMT.20.d:0 "The Dalai Lama received reports that major roads and strategic crossings are being blocked by armed men. It appears the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama himself in terms of spiritual importance, is orchestrating a coup. This is a direct reaction to our decision not to accept Chinese sovereignty and we suspect the Chinese are urging the Panchen Lama to act. For the Panchen Lama, he has expressed a desire for greater political authority, and it appears that is what the Chinese are promising him. He has also been organizing his own fighters and is no doubt using them in this coup attempt. Our own loyalists in Lhasa are organizing to respond, but it is unclear if we will stop the coup."
KMT_MIL.2.d:0 "The Justice Investigation Bureau is the premier intelligence agency for the republic. It is directly under the executive committee but the recent war with Japan and the communists exposed its weaknesses. The organization at times appears prone to corruption and bribery. On the ground intelligence was also weak as the organization struggled to gather information of communist infiltration and movements. A new reform plan is being implemented to upgrade training, improve the organization, and increasing pay to raise morale. More importantly, the influence of military officers will be limited to improve the ability of the JIB to investigate military matters."
KMT_MIL.3.d:0 "The reforms and investigations of the Republic of China military reveals a number of high-ranking officers are ideologically compromised or prone to corruption. The executive leadership must decide how to proceed. Some advocate a great purge be conducted to remove these negligent officers from important positions. Such drastic action may alienate the military and impact morale for the short-term, but have long-term benefits. The other possible solution would be to send these officers to difficult or isolated posts, especially in the frontier. These officers would no longer be in a position to negatively affect the defense and be kept from achieving higher ranks. Going this route would lessen the impact on the military institutionally, but the positive impacts would not be as much as with a mass purge."
KMT_MIL.4.d:0 "The executive leadership decided to deploy those officers identified as being ideologically compromised, corrupt, or militarily inept to the frontier. This will keep these officers from important leadership positions and often isolated from forming military cliques. These frontier positions lack many of the comforts or glory found in other postings. These officers will now find their routes to promotion blocked and many are expected to eventually retire. Removing these officers to the frontier will help us curb corruption and inefficiency, opening the way for more competent and patriotic officers to take over."
KMT_MIL.5.d:0 "President [CHI.GetLeader] directed military, police, and intelligence authorities to begin the mass arrest of officers identified as being ideologically compromised, politically corrupt, or criminally incompetent for their position. This mass arrest of military officers opens many vacancies and will cause unease within the military. However, the path for younger, patriotic, and competent officers to take higher positions is now open. This period of arrests and purges will no doubt cause panic and organizational challenges in the military, but once it ends, the defense of the Republic of China will be far stronger."
KMT_MIL.6.d:0 "The purges of military officers by the Republic of China government appears to be ending. The last group of officers were recently detained, tried, and sentenced. Many analysts believe it will take time for the Chinese military to re-establish morale and stability within its ranks. However, the government is confident once the newly promoted officers gain confidence and experience, the military capabilities of the republic will be much stronger than before. There is also confidence that the purges will indicate to younger officers and those joining the military academies that they must be professional and devoted to the nation."
FRA_KMT.1.d:0 "The Republic of China privately approached our government with a request for cooperation in nuclear technology, including weaponization. The Chinese note they have access to nuclear materials and are building an extensive infrastructure. However, they are in need of French expertise and experience in the nuclear field. China is in a vital region and faces major threats from communist neighbors. If we support China, we could strengthen anti-communism in the region and assert our influence in China. Such a relationship could help protect our own interests in the region. However, supporting the Chinese may alienate the Soviets and Americans. Another issue is that some advisors question whether the benefits are worth what the Chinese would need from us."
FRA_KMT.2.d:0 "The French government indicated they will aid us in our efforts to develop our nuclear program. This will be a major boon for our efforts to acquire a nuclear deterrence. More importantly, we will not be beholden to the United States and the relationship with France will be far more cooperative. We can offer France access to nuclear materials for their own programs. Our top nuclear officials plan on visiting Paris to visit their counterparts in the coming days."
FRA_KMT.3.d:0 "The French government rejected our proposal for nuclear cooperation. They apparently do not see the benefits of a joint venture and alignment of interests between our states. We are not aware if the French decision is due to fears of foreign repercussions or direct threats from other powers. Regardless, it is their loss and the people of China will continue its path to nuclear deterrence. The government will redouble its efforts to support the scientists and facilities dedicated to advancing Chinese nuclear technology."
KMT_Sinification.0.d:0 "The Republic of China launched an intensification of its Sinification Campaign. The government has long sought to forge national unity by spreading Chinese culture and language across all communities. Privately, one official said that all people must become Chinese or leave the country and that the day of the barbarian was over. The campaign is facing resistance, especially in the frontier provinces of China who are often not ethnically Chinese or follow their own cultural or religious traditions. The government does not appear to be overly concerned of non-Chinese backlash."
KMT_VICTORY_TERROR.0.d:0 "The Republic of China government recently launched a campaign to stamp out dissent and threats to the state. The police and other state agencies have already opened investigations of politicians, writers, activists, and intellectuals accused of either sympathizing with or openly supporting enemies of the state. In particular, the focus appears to be on communist sympathizers and criminal elements. Many human rights activists are  expressing concern that this new crackdown on dissent marks a "White Terror" and will be used to crush any threat to the ruling party at the expense of individual or political rights."
KMT_CULTS.0.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to legitimize the secret cults that flourish across rural China. These quasi-religious and cultural movements have existed for centuries. Many of the most powerful uprisings in Chinese history have occurred because of these cults. In recent decades, local self-defense forces have formed from these groups in the era of warlords and civil war. The Chinese government believes that by legitimizing these groups, it will bring these self-defense forces and stability provided by these groups in support of the state. However, there are fears that such groups may use this legitimization to expand their influence with the protection of the state."
KMT_CULTS.1.d:0 "The Republic of China decided to crackdown and dismantle the secret cults and societies that flourish across rural China. While these groups have existed for centuries, in recent decades they began forming local self-defense forces amidst the general lawlessness from the era of warlords and civil war. By targeting these groups, the Chinese government will risk a law and order crisis until it can establish a presence in these areas. Others worry these cults may even turn into brigands and further erode law and order. Regardless, the move indicates a strong commitment by the Chinese state to assert its control over the country."
KMT_SHOW_TRIALS.1.d:0 "A series of mass public trials are occurring across the Republic of China. Japanese military prisoners from the Second Sino-Japanese War and communist activists accused of crimes during the civil war are being put in open court. The government is publicizing these trials across the country and early indications indicate the courts will convict all those charged. The government is eager to demonstrate the strength of the Republic of China and provide the Chinese people justice. Opponents to the government and international observers condemn the trials as purely for show and political theatre."
KMT_LAND_REFORM.1.d:0 "In a surprise decision, the Republic of China passed a new, comprehensive Land Reform Law, meant to reducing the overwhelming power of landlords and provide opportunities to peasants. For decades, the ruling KMT established strong ties with rural landlords and for years its failure to support land reform proved advantageous to the communists. The government hopes its commitment to land reform will endear peasants to the state and cut the communists from a fertile pool of recruits for their insurgency operations."
KMT_LAND_REFORM.2.d:0 "The Republic of China passed a new Land Reform Law, which the government claims mark a dramatic victory for the peasants of China. However, despite their claims of achieving a major reform, many local and international observers claim the reforms are minimal. Landlords retain many loopholes and peasants will not find dramatic changes to their situation. It appears the government is not willing to lose its traditional support from the landlords who provide economic and political support to the state."
CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.0.d:0 "The Republic of China announced it would lift Martial Law from the country. This is part of a major reform effort within the ruling KMT party. The reformers strongly believe the restoration of constitutional and democratic rights will weaken dissent and popular support to regional leaders or communist infiltrators. Similar reforms are likely to continue, despite criticism from some of the old guard in the party that such reforms and democratization could lead to a loss of control and dissent. The decision to lift Martial Law is being largely lauded across the country."
CHI_MARTIAL_LAW.1.d:0 "The Republic of China passed legislation making the current Martial Law in the country permanent. This is a major victory for the KMT old guard which long argued against reformers advocating a restoration rights or democratic practices. They argue such reforms would make China weak and vulnerable to the threat of regional warlords and communist influence. The Chinese government believes continued Martial Law will keep the state strong, stop internal dissent, and help curb the influence of hostile ideologies or nations."
TIBET_KMT.3.d:0 "The Republic of China strongly condemned the Dalai Lama for his naked usurpation of sovereignty from China. The Chinese government claims the Dalai Lama has illegally ceded territory and conducting foreign affairs without permission from China, who is the sovereign. The Chinese call on the Dalai Lama to cease his provocations and affirm his loyalty to China, noting that he should appreciate how much autonomy and respect he receives from the republic."
TIBET_KMT.10.d:0 "In a surprise to many observers, the Republic of China signed an agreement with Tibet that recognizes its independence. The Chinese government stated its belief that the territory had been conquered by an oppressive Qing Empire and the new, democratic Chinese state could not hold on to a territory seized for the vanity of an emperor. The Tibetan government, led by the Dalai Lama, praised President [CHI.GetLeader] for his able leadership and promised a new era of peace between the two states. Many observers believe China is seeking to establish friendly ties with Tibet and keep it as a buffer state with South Asia."
TIBET_KMT.5.d:0 "The leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, refused an ultimatum from the Republic of China to recognize the Chinese government as the sovereign of the country. The Chinese accuse the Dalai Lama of ceding territories and conducting affairs as a head of state and not as a subordinate to the Republic of China. The Chinese argue they are willing to give the Dalai Lama and Tibet wide autonomy, but in exchange, the Dalai Lama must stop conducting himself as an independent head of state. The Tibetan government refusal is a clear indication that the Dalai Lama is claiming complete independence from China."
TIBET_KMT.6.d:0 "The Dalai Lama announced that Tibet is a sovereign part of the Republic of China and he is not a head of state. This marks an acceptance by the Dalai Lama of Chinese demands that he accept the sovereignty of the republic and halt any efforts to negotiate treaties or cede territories on his own authority. The Dalai Lama likely agreed after receiving assurances that the Chinese would provide Tibet immense autonomy and keep the current government to administer the territory for China. Some observers believe fears of a military intervention or Chinese-sponsored uprising were also factors pushing Tibet to accept the Chinese demands."
TIBET_KMT.21.d:0 "The Dali Lama was overthrown in a recent coup organized by the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama, the spiritual number two of the Dalai Lama has for years harbored a desire for increased political influence. It appears armed troops loyal to him were able to secure key passes and towns, including the entrances to Lhasa. With the only recourse being a civil war, the Dalai Lama decided to instead order his loyalists to stand down. The new Tibetan government announced it will accept Chinese sovereignty on the condition Tibet retains its autonomy. Many international observers believe the Panchen Lama enjoyed the backing and even the arms of the Republic of China."
TIBET_KMT.22.d:0 "An attempted coup to remove the Dali Lama in Tibet ended in failure. Fighters loyal to the Panchen Lama, spiritually second to the Dalai Lama, sought to seize control of strategic towns, passes, and entrances to Lhasa in order to force the rapid capitulation of the Dalai Lama. However, loyalists to the Dalai Lama thwarted the effort to capture areas around Lhasa and the Panchen Lama soon found his loyalists melt away once groups of pro-Dalai Lama fighters came to challenge them. In a statement the Dalai Lama claimed to have stopped a pro-Chinese attempt to seize power and pledged he would not compromise on the independence of his country. The Republic of China denied any involvement, although some photographs emerged showing the Panchen Lama fighters with Chinese rifles."
TIBET_KMT.11.d:0 "A new agreement was reached between the Republic of China and India. Many of the previous disputes were removed following the Republic of China recognizing the independence of Tibet. Previously, China claimed sovereignty over Tibet and viewed itself as the sovereign to decide the border between India and Tibet. With Tibet recognized as independent, the Chinese border with India is much smaller and less in dispute. After brief negotiations the two sides were able to sign an agreement to formally settle their border. Both the Chinese and Indian government expressed hope that the new settlement will hopefully spur a renewed friendship between the largest democracies in Asia."
CHI_SEATO.1.d:0 "The Republic of China agreed to join the Southeast Treaty Organization (SEATO) in order to expand its cooperation between member states and combat communist influence in the region. For the Chinese government, joining the group will expand its regional role and allow it access to local allies as it seeks to coordinate anti-communist activities in Asia. The Chinese government expressed its excitement at participating in the next SEATO Summit. The United States is especially happy for China to join as it gives the organization greater legitimacy. The Soviet Union and regional communist parties are condemning the action and accuse SEATO of being an imperialist front. Opposition members have privately told the media their concerns that SEATO may offer little material benefits and make China a larger target for international communism."
TIBET_KMT.15.d:0 "The Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibet, called on the international community to defend the country following reports that the Republic of China launched an invasion. Chinese troops are reportedly streaming into Tibet with the objective of establishing Chinese control. The Chinese government claims it is not launching an invasion but is instead doing a local action to restore control over a province. The Chinese argue the Dalai Lama is an autonomous administrator, but his recent claims to being independent and efforts to negotiate territory are clear violations and he must be brought to task. The Chinese insist all efforts at a peaceful resolution were rejected by the Dalai Lama and it hopes to swiftly restore law and order for the people of Taiwan."
TIBET_KMT.16.d:0 "Following the recent invasion of Tibet by the Republic of China, the traditional Tibetan aristocracy finds itself facing arrest or charges. This aristocracy has long been a major source of legitimacy, membership, and power for the Dalai Lama and his government. The Chinese decision to target this group and weaken them economically and militarily is to break the base of support for the old government. If the Dalai Lama and his allies lose bases of local support, this will strengthen efforts by the Chinese government to establish a more compliant Tibetan state. More importantly, Chinese officials brought to Tibet will also be protected from local competition. A number of Tibetan aristocrats are said to be fleeing in the direction of Nepal, India, and Burma."
TIBET_KMT.105.d:0 "Following the successful coup by the Panchen Lama against the Dalai Lama, Tibet signed an agreement with the Republic of China. Tibet will be a part of China and be known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The Chinese government promised to provide support for the Panchen Lama, including giving him extensive political power, in exchange for his government submitting to Chinese sovereignty. The Tibetan and Chinese government insist that the administration and governance of Tibet will remain largely the same, however, Tibet will no longer be able to conduct foreign policy or have complete control of its military forces."
CC_CLIQUE_FALL.0.d:0 "As part of the recent political reforms and democratization in the Republic of China, President [CHI.GetLeader] signed a new law relinquishing a number of powers back to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan, once a rubber stamp for the ruling KMT has begun holding much more debates and passing laws without direction from the executive council. Observers believe the new reforms are turning the Legislative Yuan into a more potent political institution and check to executive power in the Republic of China."
CC_CLIQUE_FALL.1.d:0 "The CC Clique faction within the KMT has seen a major drop in its influence and power within the Republic of China. Many of its prominent leaders are facing corruption charges or being removed from key posts. Media reports highlight some of the military and political failures of CC Clique leaders over the last few decades. The CC Clique represents the rightwing of the KMT and established a reputation for being virulently anti-communist, anti-Japanese. However, the new democratization reforms have opened positions to other groups and many reformers view the CC Clique as the old guard that must be replaced if China is to prosper. Reformers hope the weakening of the CC Clique will enable a smooth transition to democracy. CC Clique leaders warn rapid reforms will lead to instability and misgovernance."
KMT_Atoms.1.d:0 "The Republic of China announced its full acceptance and support for the Atoms for Peace program initiated by the United States. Atoms for Peace is a program that encourages nations to learn about the risks and benefits of nuclear technology. The program provides support on education and technical assistance in developing nuclear reactors. The Chinese government believes the program will help it train nuclear scientists and develop its own nuclear technology to better reach its energy needs as it looks to a brighter future. Regional communist parties are criticizing the program as a covert means for China to acquire the means to produce nuclear weapons and accuse the United States of supporting the nuclearization of East Asia."
CHI_INDO.10.d:0 "The Republic of China clearly showed its pro-French position in regard to Indochina by launching a series of military operations against Viet Minh positions along the Chinese border with Vietnam. The Chinese had stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in the region during the second World War and have extensive knowledge of Vietnamese nationalist positions. The Chinese government claims its forces are targeting the communist Viet Minh and its operations are meant to prevent the expansion of communism in the region. In response to criticism that it is supporting imperialism, the Chinese noted that not targeting the Viet Minh would only ensure the Vietnamese people replace the oppression of colonialism with the slavery of communism. The Viet Minh are said to be reeling from these strikes."
ROC_VICTORY.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union and its ally Mongolia recently intervened in the Chinese Civil War to prevent the total collapse of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) as it struggled to hold back the Republic of China. After intense fighting, a ceasefire emerged. Mongolia has taken control of Inner Mongolia, calling it a buffer zone from Chinese aggression. At the same time the PRC, with Soviet support, have established control in the Beijing, its surrounding areas, and Manchuria. In the west, Sinkiang has joined East Turkestan. The rest of China, including most of its industrial base and ethnic Han population, is under the control of the Republic of China. The uneasy ceasefire is currently holding, but both sides are expected to rebuild their arsenals and plan for a future resolution of the conflict in their favor."
ROC_CLIQUE.15.d:0 "Efforts of restoring internal stability and harmony in the Republic of China appear to be failing as several military cliques have risen up against the government. These military cliques are reminiscent to what was seen during the Warlord Period where military leaders formed loyal forces led by officers who shared similar professional, cultural, or territorial backgrounds. Many in China claim a Second Warlord Period has begun and there are worries of potential civil war, political instability, or a breakdown in law and order. The Chinese government claims the situation will be handled swiftly and China would not be the victims of any warlords."
ROC_CLIQUE.16.d:0 "Jiao Yulu, a former communist, has returned to his roots as a cult leader by proclaiming himself the heir to the Ming Empire. His claim is being backed by the popular Red Spear Society and other cults dedicated to the restoration of the Ming dynasty. The return of warlordism and rise in public distrust has seen a surge of popularity to such groups which organize local self-defense forces to combat warlords, bandits, and those deemed as corrupt government officials. The Ming pretender wants to overthrow the Republic of China to restore imperial rule, claiming the republic lacks the mandate of heaven and China needs a new dynasty. The Chinese government will have to restore public trust and respond swiftly before this monarchist movement becomes too powerful."
ROC_CLIQUE.1.d:0 "The powerful Hunan Clique has risen up against the republic. These military officers, citing oppressive government actions and interventions in local affairs, want greater autonomy and a reduction of centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Hunan to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Hunan officers are known to have established ties with the communists during the 1920s and 1930s. There are fears from the Chinese government that the Hunan Clique may use those contacts and invite the communists for military help but end up handing the region over to the enemy."
ROC_CLIQUE.2.d:0 "The Ningxia Ma Clique has risen against the republic. These military officers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Ningxia to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China."
ROC_CLIQUE.3.d:0 "The New Guangxi Clique has risen against the republic. One of the most powerful cliques during the 1920s and 1930s, its uprising is being viewed with great concern by the Chinese government. The Clique is rising up due to centralizing efforts and reforms targeting the cliques and old guard of the republic. The Chinese government accuses the rebelling officers of acting out of self-interest and call on all loyal officers to stay loyal to the republic. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Guangxi is a major population and economic base for China."
ROC_CLIQUE.4.d:0 "The Qinghai Ma Clique of western China has risen up against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and the oppression of cultural rights along with autonomy as the primary cause of their unrest. The Chinese government called on all officers to remain loyal and condemned the clique for seeking to stop the development of China. The Chinese government will seek to act quickly as Qinghai is close to disputed borders and there are already concerns the rebel officers may seek to ally with either a foreign or domestic enemy of the republic."
ROC_CLIQUE.5.d:0 "The Shanxi Clique has risen against the republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at breaking the current military organization as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal to the state. The Chinese government will seek to act fast in order to quell other uprisings and to bring order to Shanxi quickly. Shanxi sits close to the communists and there are fears local and foreign communist agitators may seek to use this conflict to expand their influence."
ROC_CLIQUE.6.d:0 "The Xinjiang Clique has risen against the republic. These military officers, from the west and mostly Muslim, cite oppressive government actions and interventions in the affairs of citizens. They want more autonomy and reduced centralized power. The Chinese government angrily condemned the uprising, directing all loyal officers in Xinjiang to remain loyal to the republic, though it appears their call is being largely ignored. The Chinese government will want to act fast as any uprising in the west always has the risk of sparking either a wider Islamic uprising or offer an opportunity for hostile neighbors to expand their influence in one of the frontier areas of China. The clique is noted to have had close ties with the Soviets in the past."
ROC_CLIQUE.7.d:0 "The Yunnan Clique has risen against the Republic. Its leaders cite excessive centralizing and reforms aimed at changing the current military structure of the country as the principle reasons for the uprising. The Chinese government accuses the clique of warlordism and call on all officers to remain loyal. The Chinese government will seek to ask fast as Yunnan is strategically a vital province and has access to several foreign states who may seek to use the uprising to their advantage."
ROC_CLIQUE.100.d:0 "The self-proclaimed Ming emperor of China, Jiao Yulu and his coalition of militias and cultists has brought the Second Warlord Period to an end. The charismatic former communist was able to tap into the anger and frustration of rural Chinese peasants who have grown fed up with the constant fighting between the Kuomintang, communists, and warlords. The return of the warlords was the last straw for many who feared their arrival would lead to more hardship and banditry. With Jiao Yulu victorious, the Republic of China appears on the verge of either joining forces and restoring the Ming dynasty or being destroyed."
ROC_CLIQUE.101.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. Internationally, there are increasing calls and pressure for the government to initiate new policies to prevent such a situation from emerging again."
ROC_CLIQUE.102.d:0 "The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) announced its forces had ended the Second Warlord Period. The PRC stated the corrupt and incompetent republic had led China to the point of disintegration and ruin. It then praised the peasants and people for rising up with the Peoples Liberation Army to sweep aside the corrupt warlords and incompetent republican provincial and national officials. The PRC concluded by announcing a program to provide development, prosperity, and modernization to the peasants who have been neglected and exploited for decades."
ROC_CLIQUE.103.d:0 "The Second Warlord Period has come to an end in China. The return to warlordism was bitterly received by many peasants who saw a return to banditry, instability, and violence after years of warfare. Many now hope the cliques will finally disappear permanently. The Republic of China managed to reunify the country despite the threat of militias, warlords, communists, and cults. The Chinese government must now work to rebuild not just the physical damage caused but also rebuild the trust of the Chinese people. President [CHI.GetLeader] promised to build a strong republic and lead China to its great destiny."
ROC_SOV.1.d:0 "The Soviets have requested that we call a unilateral ceasefire in the Asian Liberation War. Regardless of our territorial gains or losses, the Soviets have also asked for a status quo antebellum of territory involved during the war, effectively setting our old borders. This has proven to be a contentious issue not only in our country, but in the headquarters of our enemies as well as the United Nations Security Council. How should we move from here?"
