 saf_news.8.t:0 "The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) recently called for sanctions against South Africa for its policy of Apartheid. Member unions are being told to pressure their respective national and local businesses to refuse orders from South Africa. The ICFTU was originally founded by unions from non-communist states who felt other international unions were under communist control. In recent years, its membership has swelled with unions from newly independent states in Asia and Africa. It is these unions who are said to be leading this effort to punish South Africa. The South African government is said to be watching the situation closely as many foreign suppliers may be forced to cut orders to avoid a conflict with workers."
