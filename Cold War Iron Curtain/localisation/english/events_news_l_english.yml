 conquest.100.d:0 "The Republic of Korea is now at the brink of collapse as its capital, Seoul, has just been successfully invaded by advancing North Korean troops. North Korea, utilizing tactics similar to Blitzkrieg, have used their Soviet made tanks to forcefully advance themselves towards Seoul, with heavy casualties left for the South Koreans since they lack any sort of anti-tank weaponry or tanks at all. The South Koreans, in an effort to halt the North's advance, have blown up the bridge within Han River, trapping thousands of soldiers and civilians who desperately need evacuation and medical attention. This event in the Korean War shows the weakness of the American-backed South Korea, and observers speculate that if this trend continues, capitulation is expected to happen within months."
 
 conquest.101.d:0 " Hope for Democracy and Civil Liberties in the Korean Peninsula have once more been ignited, as the UN Coalition composed of the United States and her allies have managed to retake Seoul from the KPA stationed to garrison and occupy the city. The victory however wasn't easy, as the KPA have set up defensive fortifications at nearly every corner of the city, with barricades and anti-tank weaponry riddled all over Seoul. Nevertheless, the coalition force was able to pierce through every resistance the KPA placed on them, and have finally retaken Seoul for South Korea. This victory will send a clear message to Pyongyang that the fight for the Korean Peninsula will soon come to their shores, and their land tainted with blood and despair."
 
 conquest.102.d:0 "The tides have shifted in the Korean Peninsula, for the intervention of the People's Republic of China has brought about the fall of Seoul once more, reclaiming it from the UN coalition forces. The coalition, surprised and exhausted from the battle, have undergone a mandatory evacuation from the Seoul Metropolitan Area towards other cities in the South, but are demoralized and are incapable of fighting at this time. This defeat will play a critical role in deciding the fate of the Korean Peninsula, and so far observers believe that the coalition of China and North Korea will most likely win. However, those same observers have doubts on their predictions, since numerous reports indicate that the Chinese forces are exhausted and overwhelmed by the war, and it will take time and effort to regain their strength, which may open an opportunity for a counterattack by UN coalition forces."
 
 conquest.103.d:0 "In the light of defeat after defeat, the UN coalition forces have devised an operation that will break both the Chinese and North Korean forces. The operation is called \"Operation Ripper\", an artillery bombardment throughout the Seoul Metropolitan Area followed by a siege of the area. The artillery bombardment is designed to inflict maximum damage towards the Sino-North Korean coalition, while minimizing casualties on the UN coalition. According to our sources on the ground, it is a great success, with casualties in the tens of thousands for Chinese and the North Koreans, with half of the Seoul Metropolitan Area under UN control. Observers believe that since the war has ravaged so long, the UN will press for an armistice agreement to end the conflicts in the peninsula once and for all."
 
 conquest.104.d:0 "The capitulation of the Republic of Korea is coming sooner than expected, as North Korea was able to break the Pusan perimeter, the only line of defense for South Korea and its only major city left, as the rest have been occupied by North Korea. As of writing, the remainder of the UN coalition forces are evacuating to the island of Jeju, the only island that hasn't been touched by North Korean forces. However, seeing this, North Korea have initiated efforts in placing long range artillery that is able to target Jeju island, so observers are expecting mass casualties for the inhabitants of the island. With Pusan gone, it is expected that North Korea will claim the entirety of the peninsula and South Korea will merely be reduced to a government-in-exile similar to the governments of nations occupied by the Nazis in WW2."
 
 conquest.105.d:0 "The days of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are numbered, as the UN coalition forces have successfully invaded and occupied Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. In the midst of the chaos and confusion, some of North Korea's elites and prominent government officials were able to evacuate the capital, while some were unlucky and their fate in the hands of the UN coalition forces, with Kim Il-Sung included in those who evacuated. This is a clear victory for the UN coalition, as they have finally pushed back the North Koreans towards the mountain ranges, ensuring capitulation within months. However, observers point out that should an outside force intervene in the crisis, such as the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China, the said victory is temporary and will be catastrophic in the near future."

 conquest.106.d:0 "As coalition forces prepare to begin the occupation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reports from across the Yalu suggest a massive military buildup in Manchuria.  At a UN meeting earlier in the year, the People's Republic of China Premier Zhou Enlai warned that 'Korea is China's neighbor... The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question'.  General MacArthur in a recent meeting with President Truman at Wake Island downplayed the risk of Chinese intervention, suggesting that 'if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter'.  Regardless, tensions remain high at the prospect of escalation."

Though he was second in line after his elder brother Edward VIII, he found himself King of the British Empire at the brink of what would soon become the Second World War. Throughout the war, King George's presence boosted the morale of the subjects of the crown, both at home and on the front. His daughter Elizabeth has ascended as Queen Elizabeth II, and is making a hasty return for the funeral from abroad."

 NNE.1.d:0 "In a landmark case, Loving v Virginia has passed striking down all laws against interracial marriage. The case was brought to trial by Mildred Loving and Richard Loving, an interracial couple who were sentenced to prison in Virginia for marrying each-other. The trial went on for several days but it was eventually unanimously decided that the prohibition was unconstitutional. In addition to the passing of the law, Pace v Alabama was overturned. Pace v Alabama ruled that anti-interracial marriage laws were constitutional.\nThere are mixed reactions throughout the country but the majority sentiment is very positive in favor of the ruling. Civil rights groups are currently celebrating this day and declaring that \"Loving Day\" is officially a landmark civil rights holiday."
 NNE.2.d:0 "In a landmark case, Roe v Wade has officially declared that restricted access to abortion is unconstitutional, making the US one of the less than five countries in the world with on-demand abortion. The court ruled seven to two that the Due Process Clause protects a women's right to abortion. State and federal restrictions on abortion have been overturned. Roe v Wade has sparked national debates on whether abortion should be legal and to what extent.\nThe country seems heavily divided on the issue and grassroots movements have been activated on both sides. The pro-abortion camp, which calls itself 'pro-choice' defends the decision by claiming that it is a woman's choice and a crucial woman's right. The anti-abortion camp, which calls itself 'pro-life' opposes the decision saying it is taking the life of a child and that it is immoral.\nRegardless of anyone's views, this decision will shape US politics for years to come."
 NNE.3.d:0 "The DDR has announced that it will be constructing the Palace of the Republic. The Palace will be built in East Berlin to seat the parliament of the German Democratic Republic. The Palace is planned to be constructed on the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss in the square. The Palace of the Republic will serve as both a cultural and political testament to the German Democratic Republic.\nThe Berliner Stadtschloss was destroyed during WWII and was never repaired or replaced. Shortages in finance and a bureaucratic deadlock resulting from massive political changes prevented it from being rebuilt."
 NNE.4.d:0 "In a landmark case, Carey v Population Services International has officially ruled that it is unconstitutional to prohibit anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute nonprescription contraceptives to persons 16 years of age or over. Additionally, Carey v Population Services International also ruled that individuals under the age of 16 cannot be denied contraceptives by anyone. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment does not allow a state to intrude on an individual's decisions on matters of procreation. The primary appellee, PSI, is a nonprofit corporation to provide knowledge about birth control and provide birth control services. The secondary appellees are Reverend James Haden who led a program to give out nonprescription contraceptives, Physicians who specialize in birth control, and a resident of New York who wants to distribute contraceptives to his children."
 NNE.5.d:0 "In a landmark case, Planned Parenthood v Casey has officially ruled that states can pass laws regulating abortion past the third trimester. In Casey, plaintiffs challenged 5 of the provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982:\nInformed Consent; the doctor must provide specific information 24 hours before the procedure including health and viability\nSpousal Notice; a woman seeking abortion must notify the father\nParental Consent; minors have to have consent from the parents\nMedical Emergency; in which termination of pregnancy is immediately necessary to avert the death of the mother\nReporting Requirements; Certain reporting and record keeping mandates on facilities providing abortions"

The school district argued that the bible is a part of their curriculum and Schempp argued that it violated secularity and the freedom of religion. After a long hearing and gradual escalation, the case reached the Supreme Court. Pennsylvania's statute compelling school districts to perform Bible readings was overturned in the process. The issue has many different individuals divided and bringing arguments in favor and in opposition to the ruling."

 NNE.8.d:0 "The Berlin Palace's demolition has been announced today by the German Democratic Republic. The Palace has been declared a symbol of Prussian militarism and will be destroyed as a result. The demolition will proceed quickly and will begin within' a few weeks. Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee, is declaring that the Palace's cultural symbolism and testament are an affront to the workers of the People's Republic and to Socialism as a whole.\nThere are objections coming from people within' the GDR and outside of it who believe the Palace to be a cultural and historical monument that means far more, if at all, than militarism.\nThe process is estimated to take 3-5 months and 19 tons of dynamite."
 NNE.9.d:0 "\nLhamo Dhondrub, now known as Tenzin Gyatso, has been proclaimed as the 14th Dalai Lama. Officially declared the Dalai Lama in 1940, Tenzin Gyatso has officially assumed his full duties at the age of 15.\nIn the late 1930s, Reting Rinpoche had a vision that led him to the home of the Dalai Lama's incarnation, Lhamo Dhondup. Sera Lama reported that Lhamo Dhondup held an old rosary that belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama and the boy recognized Sera Lama immediately. Lhamo Dhondup also referred to Sera Lama in the dialect of the 13th Dalai Lama which his biological mother could not recognize. He was presented with a series of possessions, some of which belonged to the Dalai Lama and others that did not.\nThe assumption of duty will have major implications for Buddhists around the world and the political region in general. The decisions and teachings of the 14th Dalai Lama will pave the political landscape for years to come."
 NNE.10.d:0 "Alger Hiss, an American government official, has been accused of being a Soviet spy and is being convicted. The evidence against Alger Hiss includes a claim by Whittaker Chambers, a former US Communist Party Member, that Alger Hiss was a communist. Hiss filed a defamation suit against Chambers. However, Chambers also produced new evidence that both he and Hiss were involved in espionage. The court will proceed in light of this evidence and include perjury as some of the evidence conflicts with claims that Alger Hiss had made previously. The trial has brought up new discussions regarding the extent of Soviet espionage in the United States."

 NNE.12.d:0 "\nSenator Kefauver has begun hearings on organized crime, a major problem according to United States articles of 1949. Kefauver has already said he plans to interview over five hundred people on the topic of organized crime. Kefauver has publicly stated that he believes that a large Sicilian organization based on family ties operates a large mafia throughout the United States. The Committee plans to nationally broadcast these hearings to the entire country. Regardless of whether Kefauver's prediction is correct, this will go a long way to help understand and destroy the problem of organized crime in the United States."
 NNE.13.d:0 "A massive, magnitude 8.6 earthquake has struck the region of Assam-Tibet. More than 1,526 people were killed and 30000 were injured and massive amounts of property damage were reported. The earthquake has been traced back to 2 continental plates converging. Geological field studies from around the globe are being sent to the site of the earthquake to study it and humanitarian aid is arriving around the world to help. However, in a shocking development, there are hundreds of 'disaster tourists' who are arriving to see the destruction but do not intend to aid. Unlike the scientists who are avoiding travelling in paths that obstruct humanitarian efforts, the disaster tourist vehicles are blocking infrastructure and caused minor setbacks. Despite this, relief efforts will progress nominally."
 NNE.14.d:0 "Pope Pius XII has promulgated Humani Generis, the latest Papal Encyclical. The Encyclical seeks to address many opinions that the Pope believes are threatening to undermine the foundations of Catholic Doctrine. It addresses the role of theology, obstacles to finding God, issues the Pope has with modern culture, several theological developments involving the Catholic Church after WWII, and polygenism. Additionally, the Encyclical takes a nuanced position with evolution and states that human sciences are not in conflict with biblical teachings. The position on evolution has many theologians reconsidering their positions and many religious individuals leaving the Young Earth theory behind."
 NNE.15.d:0 "The US federal government is conducting a long series of prosecutions against the Communist Party of the United States. The group has been charged with the violation of the Smith Act, a statute that imposes penalties on people for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The defendants are countering by stating that they want a peaceful transition and that no matter what, the Freedom of Speech protects their views and statements. CPUSA's statements have sparked a national debate over the Freedom of Speech which has drawn people around the country to argue in favor of CPUSA's right regardless of their own personal affiliations or feelings about communism."
 NNE.16.d:0 "After 4 months and 19 tons of dynamite, the Berlin Palace has been officially demolished despite objections. The foundation was so solid that the entire mount of the building remained intact even when it fell onto the ground. The only section that has not been demolished is a portal from the balcony where Karl Liebknecht had declared the GDR. Construction for a new building, the Council of the State, is being planned on the former building's site. Planning and funding have already been finished and secured respectively. The portal from the balcony will be included in the new building as it is considered important to the GDR and its culture.\nA majority of the artifacts inside will be preserved in storage, to a minor relief to people who believe the building to be culturally important."
 NNE.17.d:0 "\nJulius and Ethel Rodenberg are on trial for espionage today. The two individuals and their co-conspirators have been convicted and have a large base of evidence against them. Evidence has been found that they provided top-secret information about radar, sonar, and jet propulsion engines to the USSR. Additionally, evidence was found that they were transmitting top secret nuclear weapons data to the USSR, which is known to now be in the hands of the Soviet Union.\nThe implications of transmitting nuclear weapons data to the Soviets are severe. Up until now, the only country that has nuclear weapons is the US. However, with the loss of this data, the Soviet Union will be able to begin construction of its own nuclear weapons and pose a threat to the western powers.\nThe shakedown for other spies who were involved is underway and the country's nuclear research facilities are under lockdown until the shakedown is complete."
 NNE.18.d:0 "In a landmark case, Dennis v United States has ruled that Dennis, the General Secretary of CPUSA, does not have protection under the 1st amendment if the exercise involves the creation of a plot to overthrow the government. The trial found Dennis guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government and must be punished under the Smith Act. Dennis previously claimed that there was no plot and that he advocated a peaceful transition to socialism. Ten other CPUSA members were also found convicted of advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The trial reached the supreme court and it was ruled six to two in favor of punishing Dennis and the other conspirators. The conspiring CPUSA members have been sentenced to 5 years in prison with a $10000 fine each."
 NNE.19.d:0 "The floods which have hit the North Sea's coastline this winter has had devastating results for the people of The Netherlands, Britain, and Belgium. Water Dykes proved unable to hold back the swelling tides, flooding the coasts with unprecedented fury. The Netherlands has been hit the worst, suffering near catastrophic damage as over 9% of arable land has been ruined with an estimated 1,800 lives being lost. The province of Zeeland remains in a state of disarray as severe flood damage makes transportation and rescue efforts arduous until water levels drop. Damage in Southern England and Scotland has been substantial as well, with an estimated 300 people dying due to the floods. Belgium has also taken damage to its coast, though on a much smaller scale then in comparison to its neighbors."
 NNE.20.d:0 "The New York Giants have won the National League!\nBobby Thomson, the outfielder and third baseman for the Giants struck a game-running home run for the team off of Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca. In the final inning, Thomson struct a three-run homer winning the game against the Dodgers.\nThis is a historical moment for the country as the game is the first ever televised nationally and is seen by millions of viewers with millions more hearing it on radio. The game winning strike is officially being declared the \"shot heard 'round the world\", after the gunshot that started the Revolutionary War in 1776, because it is being broadcasted to so many Americans including overseas servicemembers."

 NNE.23.d:0 "A massive strike has been organized by the United Steelworkers of America against 10 major steelmakers in the US but was stopped as President Harry S Truman nationalized the American steel industry before the walkout and gave the workers a wage increase. The steel companies who lost control of their facilities are now suing the government to regain their properties. If the President wins the case, albeit unlikely, then it could have serious implications regarding the authority of the government's ability to nationalize industry.\nSenator Joseph McCarthy is officially denouncing the president for permitting known communists to remain in employment."
 NNE.24.d:0 "In a landmark decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co v Sawyer has ruled that the president does not have the authority to nationalize industries and the steel facilities must be returned to their private owners. The supreme court declared that without authority conferred on him by Congress, the president is not allowed to seize government control over private property. The court voted six to three in favor of Youngstown Sheet & tube Co. The facilities are being immediately handed over to their former private owners but no damages are being paid from the loss of profit in the time that the facilities were under government control."

Beno Gutenberg, the director of the Caltech Seismological Lab, was surprised by the shock. He said: 'There is no doubt that yesterday's quake is the largest Southern California has had in this century.' The American Red Cross has declared the earthquake a major disaster with around 700 families affected, however access to the area has been impeded by landslides."
 NNE.27.d:0 "The Republic of China in Taiwan and Japan have finally declared peace. The delay in peace negotiations was due to neither Chinese governments attending the Treaty of San Francisco because of the Chinese Civil War. The United States is said to have exerted major pressure over Japan in order to make them sign a peace conference. The text of the Treaty is similar to the Treaty of Francisco's but it has been edited to fit the Republic of China. The Treaty does not mention who the true owner of Taiwan should be, and instead primarily deals with Japanese claims and nationals."
 NNE.28.d:0 "Thirteen Jews have been executed in Lubyanka Prison, Moscow. After being arrested since June 1949, the entire defendants were accused of undermining the Soviet Union. Their trial is an indicator of Stalin now turning against the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee which had helped Jewish culture rebuild after the Holocaust. Five Yiddish writers were also killed as part of the thirteen. One victim, Solomon Bregman, fell unconscious when the death sentence was passed and has not waken yet. Lina Stern, also convicted, was not executed due to her scientific work. Most unusually, there were no prosecutors or defense attorneys, simply three military judges who asked random questions."
 NNE.29.d:0 "Jonas Solk, an American medical researcher, has announced on CBS he has created a vaccine against the debilitating disease poliomyelitis. Solk took the approach of Maurice Brodie, which was to kill strains of polio and inject them into a person. Solk says he is writing an article for the American Medical Association that will be published soon. This is a major breakthrough in polio treatment, as it is now less susceptible to younger people who are particularly affected by it."

Among other things, the 15 closest allies to Hitler (who were still alive) were sentenced to either death or life imprisonment. The top 10 prominent members of the political and military leadership of Nazi Germany were executed by hanging. However, several other Nazi officials would commit suicide while waiting for trial. The only exception is Speer, who was to only one to show any remorse. 7 Nazi officials would be imprisoned in Spandau Prison, nicknamed the Spandau Seven, including Albert Speer, Rudolf Hess, Karl Dönitz, and others being sentenced to prison for varying amounts.

The Chinese government argues the simplification of Chinese will improve literacy and spread education across all people in China. The government believes the new changes will make publishing easier and also allow the spread of news or information to all levels of society.

He also asked the Justice Department to compile an official list of 78 subversive organizations. As the midterm election year got underway, former State Department official Alger Hiss, suspected of espionage, was convicted of perjury. In a speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, McCarthy mounted an attack on Truman's foreign policy agenda, stating that the State Department and its Secretary, Dean Acheson, harbored \"traitorous\" Communists. Advance copies of the speech distributed to the press record the number of Communists McCarthy claimed to have known as 205. Later revised, both in a letter to President Truman and in an \"official\" transcript of the speech that McCarthy submitted to the Congressional Record ten days later, he uses the number 57."

Four years later, Nikita Khrushchev confessed to Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander that the Soviets had shot down the plane. The Swedish government decided to keep this secret, though, and it was not until 1991 that this information was spread to the public, this after a former Soviet colonel admitted to the public that he had ordered it to get shot down.

For some days prior to his death, Hendrix had been in poor health, in part from fatigue caused by overwork, a chronic lack of sleep, and an assumed influenza-related illness. Insecurities about his personal relationships, as well as disillusionment with the music industry, had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day alive with Monika Dannemann. In the morning hours, Dannemann found Hendrix unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., and Hendrix was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45 p.m."

He had been on tour of Africa since 6 January, visiting Ghana, Nigeria, and other British colonies in Africa. The speech signaled clearly that the Conservative-led UK Government had no intention to block the independence to many of these territories. Macmillan's Cape Town speech also made it clear that Macmillan included South Africa in his comments and indicated a shift in British policy in regard to apartheid"

 news.1515.d:0 "Earlier this morning, advance elements of Israel's IDF have entered the Egyptian owned Sinai desert and are steadily moving towards the recently nationalized Suez Canal. Israeli leadership is stating that the cause of the war is directly tied to Egyptian Premiere Nasser's strong and repeated threat to close the Straits of Tiran, and in light of his decision to seize the canal, Israel had no choice but to strike back in self defense. So far the international community has been somewhat silent on this unexpected development, although reports and rumors state that top British and French Diplomats are already hammering out a ceasefire proposal."

While masses all over the Arab world flooded the streets to celebrate this great victory over the old imperialist powers, top diplomats and politicians all over Europe are scrambling to find some sort of reaction and figure out how this will impact their respective countries. It remains to be seen just how long Nasser will be able to hold on to his new territory."

 news.1517.d:0 "It seems that the chain reaction stemming from Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal isn't quite finished, as today both Britain and France joined Israel in carrying out military action against the country. British Airborne Units landed in and around Port Said and quickly pushed back the few Egyptian brigades in the town, while the French met were met with similar success at Port Faud. However, they were not able to keep the Canal clear of blockage, as Egyptian forces sunk a few large tankers in the middle of the passage before the Anglo-French coalition could stop them. Thus, while the British have achieved a great military victory, the incoming oil shortage which will affect all of Europe seems to be of much greater import."

 news.1518.d:0 "When the British and French invaded Egypt in conjunction with Israel, they had hoped that at the very least the international community would sit by and let the situation unfold. However, the opposite has occurred, as the United States was at the head of an international outrage against the Anglo-French-Israeli operation. Today, that outrage has culminated with the United Nations passing 2 resolutions that demand an immediate end to the conflict and the handing over of the canal to a UN peacekeeping force. While the Tripartite Pact seemed to be successful militarily, it is clear that the Suez Crisis has been no less than a political disaster, with heavy repercussions for all 3 countries."

Despite the early stages of the conflict for the Sinai and Suez Canal showing Egypt to be on the retreat, nevertheless its army was able to recover and push Israel out of the Sinai, effectively ending any chance of success for the Tripartite Pact. Details of the ceasefire negotiations are still unclear, but it seems likely that Nasser will demand some form of reparations and of course, keep the canal under Egyptian control."

The move came as a surprise to many Middle East Policy experts, as Nasser isn't known to cede on anything so lightly. Nevertheless, all hostilities in the Sinai have stopped, and British soldiers have moved to reclaim the canal under the terms of the deal. It is left up to the imagination what may have occurred instead if Nasser rejected the proposal, and for now, there is once again peace in the Middle East"

 news.1600.d:0 "Breaking news are arriving from Argentina of a successful coup d'état against the Peronist government. The coup d'état occurred when members of the Army, Navy and Aeronautics, under the command of retired General Benjamín Menéndez and Eduardo Lonardi, successfully overthrew the government of President Juan Domingo Perón. In their brief proclamation, the rebels accused the government of having led the Nation to "a total bankruptcy of its internal and external credit, both morally and spiritually as well as materially". The restrictions on civil liberties and the actions of political opponents, the constitutional reform that allowed the re-election of the President, as well as the measures to politicise the armed forces seem to have influenced the military adherents to the movement. Despite some disagreements amidst the rebel leadership, the coup was launched during a favourable political moment and was successful, with Peron's current whereabouts being unknown. While the current provisional military dictatorship promised a return to democratic processes, they argue this will only happen when all Peronist influences are removed from all levels of government. It remains to be seen if Argentina will become a democratic nation one day."
