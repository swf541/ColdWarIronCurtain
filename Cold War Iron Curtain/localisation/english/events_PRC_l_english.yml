 PRC_Dispute.1.d:0 "The British Raj negotiated its boundaries along the Himalaya's with Tibet and China. Following the takeover of Tibet by the PRC, the new regime decided to void many of these treaties, arguing that the Tibetan government had no legitimacy to negotiate treaties. The Chinese move to develop roads and troop posts in disputed areas led to strong Indian protests and troop deployments. The tensions are focused in Aksai Chin and the North East Frontier Agency. In Aksai Chin a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was established to separate Chinese from Indian forces but recently the Indian Army initiated a Forward Policy. However, the conflict has expanded into a full-on border clash as Chinese forces have begun surrounding some of these posts while the Indian Army appears poised to send troops to secure its posts and disputed clash. As both India and China rush troops to the conflict zone, the world waits to see what will result and whether this border violence will escalate to a broader conflict."
 PRC_Dispute.2.d:0 "The Chinese government announced it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in its conflict with India after it drove Indian forces out of the disputed territories along the Himalayas. From the beginning of the conflict, the Indian Army's Forward Policy in the disputed territories failed to disrupt Chinese forces. Instead, Indian border posts were overwhelmed and Indian forces collapsed in the face of Chinese infiltration tactics. New Delhi has reacted in shock with India's government pleading with Western powers to aid it and prevent a Chinese invasion. Although China appears to have halted its ambitions to just the border areas, India remains apprehensive an escalation could lead to a complete military collapse. Washington and London have both shown equal concern to the communist threat. Observers believe India will likely receive aid to replenish its losses but India's pride has been humbled by its disastrous performance. Military leaders in Pakistan are said to be watching these developments with glee."
 PRC_Dispute.3.d:0 "Since 1945, the People's Liberation Army has appeared almost unstoppable in achieving its objectives. However, following the Chinese government's request for a ceasefire and discussions with India, it has become clear the Indian Army has prevailed in the recent border conflict in the Himalaya's. India will no doubt seek to secure its claims and are likely to succeed as Chinese forces are said to have been driven out of the disputed lands. The Indian Army's Forward Policy has proven to be very successful. Indian forces successfully ambushed Chinese forces in the area and the professional training and leadership was said to have been instrumental in India's success over what Western observers considered a \"peasant army\". Domestically, the Indian government has asserted its strength to its people and have shown the world India did not need to rely on foreign powers to protect itself from its enemies. In Beijing, a lot of soul searching and analysis must be done, though the government has proven successful in suppressing news of the military setbacks to the population."
 SINO_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government's dangerous game of interfering with Tibet and deploying its forces into Chinese territory has been met with a befitting response. The Indian effort to infiltrate our border and seize Tibet resulted in them overstretching their capabilities. Our battle hardened and patriotic forces utilized the lessons we have learned in mountain warfare to overwhelm and destroy the Indian forces in the disputed territory. The professional soldiers of the Indian Army proved they are simple puppets devoted to money, not patriotism and were easily defeated by our forces. Upon securing the disputed territory, we announced a unilateral ceasefire, our forces can secure the territory and we have announced to the world how we have humiliated our enemy. More importantly, enemy propaganda that we are planning a general invasion has proven false. However, considering how successful we have been, we must consider whether we want to continue the fighting into India proper to secure a major revolutionary victory. Or should we stick to our ceasefire and just complete our annexation of Aksai Chin."
 SINO_INDIA.11.d:0 "After heavy fighting with India along our Himalayan border, news has reached us that People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces have been driven out of the disputed territories. The conniving Indian forces had established fortified positions earlier behind our lines in the leadup to the fighting. From these positions the enemy successfully interdicted supply lines and ambushed troops moving through our own territory. Emboldened with their treacherous success, Indian forces surged in support to finish driving us out of the disputed lands. The Indian government announced their forces success in occupying the lands they claimed. The PLA has been humiliated and some commanders are already suggesting the peasant soldier model may not be viable now that China has vast borders to protect. Perhaps more professionalism, along the lines of the Indian Army maybe needed to ensure in future conflicts our forces will be capable of responding to border incidents like this. We will have to sit with the Indian government and listen to their demands for the border, hopefully Tibet will not be compromised by these events."
 SINO_INDIA.12.d:0 "The Chinese aggression began with its seizure of Tibet. The cunning Chinese talked of peace but were acting to seize our lands. From the Himalayas, China would have been poised to plunder our lands but our forces have prevailed. Today, we received a note from the Chinese government asking for a ceasefire to stop the battering of its forces and also asked for immediate discussions on the border. General B.M. Kaul's direction for the Army to engage in a Forward Policy to interdict Chinese infiltrators ended up being a sound strategy. Our professional troops and officers conducted their objectives to perfection. Chinese infiltration efforts were cut off by our forward posts. The Army's assessment that Chinese troops were just armed peasants who could not handle professional soldiers has proven correct. With this victory, we can now dictate the border to its proper dimensions. The Chinese can no longer ignore the treaties or demarcations of the past and more importantly they will have to return the Kashmir lands illegally claimed by them. In New Delhi, jubilant crowds took to the streets chanting 'Jai Hind!' and showering anyone in a military uniform with flowers. Military bases across the nation have received deliveries of sweets from grateful citizens as independent India has demonstrated its status as a major power."
 SINO_INDIA.13.d:0 "The Indian government received a note from the Chinese government that it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in Aksai Chin and the North-East Frontier Agency. Chinese forces secured almost all the disputed territory and Indian resistance had almost completely crumbled in the disputed zone. Our Army's decision to launch a Forward Policy of aggressive patrolling and establishing posts behind Chinese troop positions proved to be poorly conceived. Chinese infiltration tactics successfully isolated and overrun many of these posts. More importantly, Indian troops marched to the Himalayan combat zone in summer uniforms and lacked intelligence. One junior officer bitterly complained his unit had to use local tourist maps as their own maps on the territory was almost worthless. Across India, fears of further Chinese aggression are palpable, while the Indian Army itself must consider some soul searching. Despite this, patriotism remains high. Logistics and specialized training for troops must be a priority and many officers argue the military must evolve its doctrines beyond the World War II experience. Although the Chinese have stopped and achieved their objectives, many in India are holding their breath as they fear further Chinese aggression to take advantage of India's military setbacks. At the very least, we are at the mercy of Chinese wishes in the disputed lands."
 SINO.INDIA.T:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]The Invasion of India"
 PRC_Dispute.4.d:0 "The woes for the Indian military and government continued as the People's Liberation Army announced it was launching an invasion of India. The PLA says its objective is to liberate the people of India from colonial oppression This marks a dramatic change as the PLA initially portrayed the conflict as a border dispute and Indians now fear waves of Chinese divisions will soon pour out of the Himalayas into the Indian plains. The Indian Army had earlier attempted to dislodge the PLA and secure their claims along its disputed border with China through a policy of establishing small outposts in the disputed lands. In New Delhi an atmosphere of fear is palpable as the government now has ordered the military to redeploy its entire force to face the Chinese threat. However, in other major cities, many Indians have taken to the street to demonstrate their support for the military, many young men have pledged to resist the Chinese."
