Walter attended primary school for eight years of his official education, later transferring education to study joining & artisanship. Both of Ulbricht's parents were members of the SPD(Social Democratic Party) which Walter would eventually register for in 1912. An impressionable teenage Ulbricht had radicalized his views to the point where he joined the Communist Party of Germany after deserting the army twice during the great war. Post-war, Ulbricht was elected to the party's central committee. Seeing to bolshevize the communist party as well as reorganizing it into an operational cell structure. Walter would become an instrumental member of the party, eventually being elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the Communist Party. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Ulbricht fled the country to live abroad working as a KPD operative, rigorously persecuting Troksyites and other deviants. Ulbricht returned to eastern occupied Germany in 1945 to assist in the reconstruction of the KPD and eventual merger with the SPD to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party). By 1949 with the establishment of the DDR, Walter was appointed deputy prime minister of the state and created the General Secretary position in the administration. By Pieck's death in 1960, Walter swiftly consolidated power and eliminated all opponents of his, ensuring de-Stalinization would not occur in the DDR. Until the unveiling of the Berlin wall, Ulbricht's authority over the economy saw little liberalization with massive surveillance over the people of East Germany. Eight years after the death of Stalin, Ulbricht seemingly remains the last man in the bloc who continues to embrace Stalinization. The question remains, what will the union's new leadership think of this."

Living quite a modest life alongside his four siblings and parents, Mátyás's family moved to Hungary. In his early 20s, Rákosi embraced social democracy, later becoming a communist supporter. Rákosi believed that atheism was a core value of the communist cause, eventually denouncing his personal Jewish faith. Serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the great war, Rákosi was captured as a prisoner of war in the Russian Army. In 1918, Rákosi returned to Hungary as a staunch communist undertaking commissar duties in the short-lived Hungarian Communist Bela Kun regime. Mátyás was forced to flee to Moscow due to the counter-revolution in Hungary, and in 1924 dispatched back to Hungary to reorganize the Communist party in the country.

During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopia during World War II, Haile Selassie made Ethiopia an active member of the League of Nations while later leading a government in exile in London. Seen as a modernizer by his supporters, Haile Selassie believes Ethiopia needs to open itself to the outside world. Upon coming to power Selassie organized Ethiopia's entry into the League of nations and in 1945 Ethiopia was a founding member of the United Nations. While most of Ethiopia is illiterate and has little opinion of the affairs of its nation, among the intelligentsia and student youth there is in contrast a wide array of criticisms towards the Emperor. These critics, view Haile Selassie as an autocrat who has failed to end the immense and devastating poverty brought by the archaic feudalistic system which controls most of the nation's people."

At the age of eight Nguema saw his father (a local witch doctor) be beaten to death by a Spanish colonial administrator for requesting better plantation working conditions. Hardly heard of in the wider Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist community, Nguema is known to wallow in obscurity and isolation. Hoarding his nation's treasury in his personal estate with a large fleet of sports cars, Nguema is unlikely to attract foreign appreciation. Personal interests of Nguema are the usage of psychoactive, hallucinogenic native plants and collecting the head's of his enemies in an alphabetically organized compartment of a warehouse. With blocking off the roads to exit Equatorial Guinea and ordering the execution of all who violate arbitrary, nonsensical laws, Francisco Macías Nguema may set himself to be the greatest leader of the twentieth century." #

It was during a university scholarship to South Africa where he first engaged deeply with African nationalist ideology. By 1960 he joined the National Democratic Party (NDP) to push the British into giving Rhodesia majority rule. After NDP party leader Joshua Nkomo failed and agreed to accept white minority rule, Mugabe, along with many other members were irate. By the end of 1961 the NDP was banned and Mugabe joined the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) as General Secretary. The election of the hardline Rhodesian Front saw racial unrest spike as African nationalists grew disenchanted with the prospect of Britain intervening or of white Rhodesians agreeing to provide equal constitutional rights to Africans. By 1963 Mugabe along with leading ZAPU leaders were imprisoned for speeches they made. After the unilateral declaration of independence by the Rhodesian Front in 1965, Mugabe and his allies encouraged armed resistance against the regime as the only way to achieve majority rule. Unlike other ZAPU leaders who either were bribed or intimidated by the Rhodesian government, Mugabe always maintained his stance regarding majority rule.

 POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "King Farouk I inherited the throne after his father died in 1936. The sixteen year had grown up in opulent luxury and almost complete isolation in the royal palace. His early reign began with much hope as he toured his country and promised to bring relief to Egypt's poverty-stricken population. His lack of political will combined with the Wafd and British actively hindering him caused Farouk to lose interest in governing. What initial goodwill he achieved largely dissipated during World War II as the massive allied military presence led to skyrocketing inflation that left many Egyptians in a dire state. His efforts during the war to leverage Egyptian cooperation for full independence led to the British military surrounding the palace to force him to capitulate to British demands. After the war he failed to negotiate a resolution on who would govern Sudan, he failed to secure a complete British withdrawal, and he led Egypt to military defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His decadent lifestyle of late-night gambling and womanizing combined with his recent failures have shook the peoples trust in his leadership. Although known for his charm and streaks of intelligence, so far the King has been unable or unwilling to make the changes Egyptians are increasingly clamoring for."

 POLITICS_NASSER_DESC:0 "Growing up, Gamal Abdel Nasser moved constantly due to his father's job as a postal worker. This exposure to the many facets of Egyptian life and the vast disparity in wealth across society had a profound impact on him. Early on Nasser read Egyptian nationalist poems, books, and participated in anti-government protests, fully embracing Egyptian nationalism. Despite his known police record as an agitator he joined the Royal Military Academy with aspirations of following the footsteps of history's great revolutionaries. While training, he connected with likeminded nationalist officers and created a close network through his ability to charm and connect with people. This network evolved into the underground anti-monarchy Association of Free Officers in 1949. Two events pushed Nasser and his fellow nationalist officers down a revolutionary path. One was the British intimidation of King Farouk I in 1942, this event demonstrated to Nasser the monarchy's impotence in the face of colonialism. Second, the utter military failure of Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Nasser and his officers felt Egypt's fighting men fought bravely but were let down by faulty equipment, royal indifference, and poor preparation from the King. After these events, Nasser worked to ensure the Association of Free Officers were prepared to move against the government when the time came.  The successful revolution would end the nearly two century long Muhammad Ali Dynasty in Egypt and break the dominance of society by the elite. Nasser quickly stood out among the Free Officers for his ability to talk to the average Egyptian, his natural charisma, and passionate belief securing a bright future for the people of Egypt."

After living in Britain and making friends with more radical elements of the British Labor party, Kenyatta travelled to Moscow with George Padmore where he was increasingly radicalized by anti-imperialist sentiment. After being a writer for the British Communist Party, Kenyatta and Padmore left the Soviet Union in protest after the abolishment of the 'International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'. However, Kenyatta became increasingly moderate and more politically conservative after his education in economics and phenotics while still keeping to his Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist roots. Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in the 1940s where he would establish himself as the undisputed leader of the Kenyan African Union. Being imprisoned during the Mau Mau uprising for his political activities, Kenyatta openly denounced any form of civil disobedience or illegal action against the colonial regime.

In his program of "Authenticité"(To authenticate Congolese nationalism), Mobutu has attempted to culturally Africanize the people and state of Zaire through strict legal force.

As most of the Free officers were young and from low backgrounds, Nasser wanted Naguib onboard to give the group credibility. In 1952 the Free Officers helped Naguib win election as president of the officers club in opposition to a man backed by King Farouk. On July 1952, the Free Officers commenced the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with a coup d'état to depose King Farouk. Naguib was appointed, first as Commander-in-Chief of Army, in order to keep the armed forces firmly behind the junior officers' coup. Naguib was not a member of the executive committee of the Free Officers and he first learned of the coup several hours after it had begun  when he was awoken by a phone call telling him the coup had begun. In Egyptian culture, age is respected and as a 51-year-old, Naguib commanded more respect than did Nasser, who was 34 years old. Nagiub's avuncular and jovial personality was felt to make him seem a reassuring figure to the Egyptian people, instead of Nasser and the other Free Officers who were completely unknown to the public before the coup.\n\nNow leading Egypt, he hopes to see a speedy return to constitutional government without unnecessary violence."

A longtime Republican leader, he was his party's presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 but lost in both elections.\nAs a New York City prosecutor and District Attorney in the 1930s and early 1940s, Dewey was relentless in his effort to curb the power of the American Mafia and of organized crime in general. Most famously, he successfully prosecuted Mafioso kingpin Charles Luciano on charges of forced prostitution in 1936. Luciano was given a 30- to 50-year prison sentence. He also prosecuted and convicted Waxey Gordon, another prominent New York City gangster and bootlegger, on charges of tax evasion. Dewey almost succeeded in apprehending Jewish mobster Dutch Schultz as well, but Schultz was murdered in 1935 in a hit ordered by The Commission itself; he had disobeyed The Commission's order forbidding him from making an attempt on Dewey's life. Dewey led the moderate faction of the Republican Party during the 1940s and 1950s, in opposition to conservative Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Dewey was an advocate for the professional and business community of the Northeastern United States. This group consisted of internationalists who were in favor of the United Nations and the Cold War fight against communism and the Soviet Union, and it supported most of the New Deal social-welfare reforms enacted during the administration of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt."

Suspiciously Nzeogwu and Aguiyi-Ironsi are both of Igbo descent, fueling northern conspiracy theories that the general allowed the Nzeogwu attempted revolution to take place so that his ascension to power would be justified with this moment of crisis.

Coming back to Nigeria in the 50s he would make a name for himself as a trade union organizer and also a student protest leader of which he became national news for when he lead protests against the Anglo-Nigerian Defense Pact and the Assassination of Patrice Lamumba. In 1963 he would found the Socialist Workers and Farmers Party of Nigeria which would become a prominent Marxist-Leninist party in Nigeria.

While in school Gowon was an excellent athlete though excelled even farther in the military structure where he became the country's youngest colonel when he lead his own division during the Congo Crisis. Due to Gowon's success as an officer he would be one of the most militarily educated in the armed forces as he was trained in multiple prestigious military academies in the United Kingdom. This would prove to be a profoundly fortunate circumstance for him when the coup of the five majors and its subsequent counter-coup by Aguiyi-Ironsi took place he was just arriving back from Joint Staff College, Latimer UK - something that kept him off of any planned hit list of northerners. Following the Northern Counter-Coup when Murtala Muhammad and his co-conspirators were convinced not to succeed the north but instead fight to keep Nigeria together they realized that a Muslim Hausa general taking over the country would greatly exacerbate ethnic tension in the country. Here is where Yakubu Gowon became the perfect candidate as a trusted northerner with no political awareness or involvement of the previous coups that was a Christian of non-Hausa decent. Being thrusted into this leadership role by the junta leads to two issues for Gowon however. This first being his lack of experience with governance or politics, but the second is more concerning to him.

After high school he would eventually make his way to Virginia in the 1920s where he would experience the injustices of Jim Crow laws and commonplace racial hatred notable of the southern United States. While becoming heavily influenced by the ideas of Garveyism, Pan-Africanism, and Afro-American activism, he would write columns in the Baltimore Afro-American, Philadelphia Tribune and the Associated Negro Press. After he achieved a bachelors degree in political science and simultaneously achieving a masters degree in Anthropology and Religion, he would return to Nigeria in the 30s where he started his own influential Pan-Africanist and Anti-Colonial Newspaper which sometimes roused the attention of authorities. Entering politics in the 1940s he would found the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) and would become a part of the colonial legislature in the 50s and then the governor of Nigeria's Eastern Region in 1954. While a coalition with the Hausa Northern People's Party only put him in the ceremonial role of President under Balewa, Zik became more successful after Aguiyi-Ironsi's transition to civilian government and the new general election.

Being the first Nigerian to earn a PHD in mathematics, he wrote papers which became influential in the field all over the world. In his late 20s however he was not content with remaining in a solely intellectual capacity and instead founded his own party, the Dynamic Party, which became one of the first Nigerian Parties in the colony to have a formal ideological manifesto. Chike Obi is not an orthodox Pan-Africanist but instead an advocate of an entirely new African based Kemalist ideology which would be radically pro-westernization, modernization, and a complete abolishment of religious and traditional order. His party's main goals are the unification of African countries with the securing of alliances around the world which they will use to fight imperialism after rapid militarization of the country with an emphasis in guerrilla tactics. Even going as far as naming his first son Mustafa, Obi follows Kemalism to a T in his path for the rapid progression of society. While originally forming a coalition with the NCNC in the first government of the country, since Aguiyi-Ironsi's transition to civilian rule the Dynamic Party has gained a moderate popularity in the country due to his promise of ending ethnic conflict in Nigeria through Kemalism."
