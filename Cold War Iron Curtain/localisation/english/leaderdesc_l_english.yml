Walter attended primary school for eight years of his official education, later transferring education to study joining & artisanship. Both of Ulbricht's parents were members of the SPD(Social Democratic Party) which Walter would eventually register for in 1912. An impressionable teenage Ulbricht had radicalized his views to the point where he joined the Communist Party of Germany after deserting the army twice during the great war. Post-war, Ulbricht was elected to the party's central committee. Seeing to bolshevize the communist party as well as reorganizing it into an operational cell structure. Walter would become an instrumental member of the party, eventually being elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the Communist Party. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Ulbricht fled the country to live abroad working as a KPD operative, rigorously persecuting Troksyites and other deviants. Ulbricht returned to eastern occupied Germany in 1945 to assist in the reconstruction of the KPD and eventual merger with the SPD to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party). By 1949 with the establishment of the DDR, Walter was appointed deputy prime minister of the state and created the General Secretary position in the administration. By Pieck's death in 1960, Walter swiftly consolidated power and eliminated all opponents of his, ensuring de-Stalinization would not occur in the DDR. Until the unveiling of the Berlin wall, Ulbricht's authority over the economy saw little liberalization with massive surveillance over the people of East Germany. Eight years after the death of Stalin, Ulbricht seemingly remains the last man in the bloc who continues to embrace Stalinization. The question remains, what will the union's new leadership think of this."

Rákosi believed that atheism was a core value of the communist cause, eventually denouncing his personal Jewish faith. Serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the great war, Rákosi was captured as a prisoner of war in the Russian Army. In 1918, Rákosi returned to Hungary as a staunch communist undertaking commissar duties in the short-lived Hungarian Communist Bela Kun regime.

Despite facing arrest and unemployment, Tito emerged as a leading party member, surviving Yugoslavian and Soviet purges. Tito rose to global prominence during World War II as he led the Yugoslavian partisans to eventual victory against the German occupation forces. He received recognition from the Allies and used his position as the recognized Prime Minister to re-constitute Yugoslavia under his complete control in 1945. He abolished the monarchy and purged non-communists. The post-war saw tensions rise between Tito and Stalin over the direction of the communist world. By 1948 the two leaders were split, and Tito has started a new series of purges against Stalinists to shore up his control over the country as power increasingly lies in his hands or with his closest supporters."

 POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "King Farouk I inherited the throne after his father died in 1936. The sixteen year had grown up in opulent luxury and almost complete isolation in the royal palace. His early reign began with much hope as he toured his country and promised to bring relief to Egypt's poverty-stricken population. His lack of political will combined with the Wafd and British actively hindering him caused Farouk to lose interest in governing. What initial goodwill he achieved largely dissipated during World War II as the massive allied military presence led to skyrocketing inflation that left many Egyptians in a dire state. His efforts during the war to leverage Egyptian cooperation for full independence led to the British military surrounding the palace to force him to capitulate to British demands. After the war he failed to negotiate a resolution on who would govern Sudan, he failed to secure a complete British withdrawal, and he led Egypt to military defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His decadent lifestyle of late-night gambling and womanizing combined with his recent failures have shook the peoples trust in his leadership. Although known for his charm and streaks of intelligence, so far the King has been unable or unwilling to make the changes Egyptians are increasingly clamoring for."

After securing Samos's union to Greece after the First Balkan War, he joined the Greek parliament and served as a minister to the Thessaloniki government that opposed King Constantine I. In 1924 he became head of the centrist Liberal Party and Prime Minister for the first of three times. During the turbulent interwar years Sofoulis was a source of moderation and compromise, able to establish relationships across the political spectrum. During World War II he was briefly detained by the Germans during their occupation of Greece but he refused to back the National Liberation Front due to its connection to communism. After World War II Sofouils offered proposals to avoid civil war, though these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1947 he returned to the Prime Minister post for a third time and currently leads the Greek government against the Democratic Army of Greece."
 POLITICS_NASSER_DESC:0 "Growing up, Gamal Abdel Nasser moved constantly due to his father's job as a postal worker. This exposure to the many facets of Egyptian life and the vast disparity in wealth across society had a profound impact on him. Early on Nasser read Egyptian nationalist poems, books, and participated in anti-government protests, fully embracing Egyptian nationalism. Despite his known police record as an agitator he joined the Royal Military Academy with aspirations of following the footsteps of history's great revolutionaries. While training, he connected with likeminded nationalist officers and created a close network through his ability to charm and connect with people. This network evolved into the underground anti-monarchy Association of Free Officers in 1949. Two events pushed Nasser and his fellow nationalist officers down a revolutionary path. One was the British intimidation of King Farouk I in 1942, this event demonstrated to Nasser the monarchy's impotence in the face of colonialism. Second, the utter military failure of Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Nasser and his officers felt Egypt's fighting men fought bravely but were let down by faulty equipment, royal indifference, and poor preparation from the King. After these events, Nasser worked to ensure the Association of Free Officers were prepared to move against the government when the time came.  The successful revolution would end the nearly two century long Muhammad Ali Dynasty in Egypt and break the dominance of society by the elite. Nasser quickly stood out among the Free Officers for his ability to talk to the average Egyptian, his natural charisma, and passionate belief securing a bright future for the people of Egypt."

Becoming politically active in the 1920s, Kenyatta travelled across British East Africa on a motorbike converting to Christianity and  developing a staunch anti-colonialist viewpoint as he witnessed the suffering and inefficiency colonialism brought on the region. After living in Britain and making friends with more radical elements of the British Labor party, Kenyatta travelled to Moscow with George Padmore where he was increasingly radicalized by anti-imperialist sentiment. After being a writer for the British Communist Party, Kenyatta and Padmore left the Soviet Union in protest after the abolishment of the 'International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'. However, Kenyatta became increasingly moderate and more politically conservative after his education in economics and phenotics while still keeping to his Pan-Africanist and Anti-Imperialist roots. Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in the 1940s where he would establish himself as the undisputed leader of the Kenyan African Union. Being imprisoned during the Mau Mau uprising for his political activities, Kenyatta openly denounced any form of civil disobedience or illegal action against the colonial regime. Now that he is free from his wrongful imprisonment, Jomo Kenyatta is determined to lead Kenya to a future of economic and social prosperity."

Being a traveling beer salesmen who wrote part time poetry however, was not satisfying enough for Lamumba and in 1958 he founded his political party of the Mouvement Nationale Congolais. Lamumba had shown himself to represent his party well in the pan-Africanist All-African People's Conference in Accras where he impressed Kwame Nkrumah with his intelligence and precise plans for independence of his nation. Like Nkrumah, Lamumba based his party on a Pan-Africanist belief and wanted to create a new Congolese identity devoid of ethnic favoritism. Speaking for his party at the Belgian roundtables, Lamumba won the national election held a month before independence. Now being in power Lamumba has found himself in a political power struggle between the President of the country, Joseph Kasa-Vubu.

Nonetheless, he caught the interest of the Free officers led by Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser. As most of the Free officers were young and from low backgrounds, Nasser wanted Naguib onboard to give the group credibility. In 1952 the Free Officers helped Naguib win election as president of the officers club in opposition to a man backed by King Farouk. On July 1952, the Free Officers commenced the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with a coup d'état to depose King Farouk. Naguib was appointed, first as Commander-in-Chief of Army, in order to keep the armed forces firmly behind the junior officers' coup. Naguib was not a member of the executive committee of the Free Officers and he first learned of the coup several hours after it had begun  when he was awoken by a phone call telling him the coup had begun. In Egyptian culture, age is respected and as a 51-year-old, Naguib commanded more respect than did Nasser, who was 34 years old. Nagiub's avuncular and jovial personality was felt to make him seem a reassuring figure to the Egyptian people, instead of Nasser and the other Free Officers who were completely unknown to the public before the coup.\n\nNow leading Egypt, he hopes to see a speedy return to constitutional government without unnecessary violence."

Early on in life Obi proved to be the best student in West Africa, quickly achieving a scholarship in the colonial government which lead him to an education in The University of Cambridge, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and The University of London. Being the first Nigerian to earn a PHD in mathematics, he wrote papers which became influential in the field all over the world. In his late 20s however he was not content with remaining in a solely intellectual capacity and instead founded his own party, the Dynamic Party, which became one of the first Nigerian Parties in the colony to have a formal ideological manifesto. Chike Obi is not an orthodox Pan-Africanist but instead an advocate of an entirely new African based Kemalist ideology which would be radically pro-westernization, modernization, and a complete abolishment of religious and traditional order. His party's main goals are the unification of African countries with the securing of alliances around the world which they will use to fight imperialism after rapid militarization of the country with an emphasis in guerrilla tactics. Even going as far as naming his first son Mustafa, Obi follows Kemalism to a T in his path for the rapid progression of society. While originally forming a coalition with the NCNC in the first government of the country, since Aguiyi-Ironsi's transition to civilian rule the Dynamic Party has gained a moderate popularity in the country due to his promise of ending ethnic conflict in Nigeria through Kemalism."
 POLITICS_C_ODUMEGWU_OJUKWU_DESC:0 "§YGeneral, President of Biafra§!\nChukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu or his nickname 'Emeka', grew up in luxury to one of the richest businessmen of Nigeria and in his youth spent his time in textbooks and overseas lectures as he would eventually attain a masters degree in history at the University of Oxford. While being born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Emeka felt discontent and wanted to set out and make a name for himself without his father's intentions being what decided his place in society. He would join the Royal West African Frontier Forces shortly after returning to Nigeria with his father pulling strings with governor Macpherson to make sure he would stay in a grueling NCO position hoping he would give up the pursuit. However he stuck through it eventually getting commissioned in 1958 and then going on to be promoted several times in the new Nigerian Armed Forces. During the Coup of the Five Majors, Emeka stayed loyal to Aguiyi-Ironsi and became the military appointed governor of the Eastern Region. During the Northern Counter-Coup there was virtually no success in the Eastern Region against Ojukwu and there were attempts to negotiate a preservation of the military hierarchy and not have the nation's junta fall into a northern favortist camp. However there were no agreements made which essentially lead into a stand-off between Gowon and Ojukwu (who were both same military rank) and when any and all promises made at the Aburi Accords fell apart Ojukwu felt no other choice but to declare the 'Republic of Biafra'. While internationally isolated outside of some minor nations and clandestine French aid, Emeka is determined to lead the Igbos to prosperity in a war for independence..."
