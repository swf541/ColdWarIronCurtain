 KOR_attack_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Introduced in 1986 as a replacement for the AH-1 in U.S. Army service, the AH-64 is one of the more well known attack helicopters in the world. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. A typical (and famous) mission loadout is known to be its 30mm Chain gun carried between the landing gear, and four stub-wing hardpoints for a mixture of Hydra rocket pods and AGM-114 Hellfire Anti-Tank Missiles. Nicknamed the 'Apache,' the AH-64 represents the pinnacle of helicopter aviation."

 KOR_scout_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed in 1960, the OH-6 was designed under the Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) project, for the purpose of observation, casualty evacuation, personnel transport and light attack. Hughes' design would be the successful one out of eleven other competing designs. It would replace the O-1 Bird Dog in the observation role when the U.S. Department of Defense directed the U.S. Army to transfer all fixed-wing aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Serving with distinction in the Vietnam War, the OH-6 had shown the value of observation helicopters as a support for attack helicopters like the AH-1 or ground forces to engage enemies. Officially known as the 'Cayuse' (after the Native American tribe from the Pacific Northwest), pilots gave it the nickname 'Loach' after the program that spawned it."

It was the first helicopter in service by any branch of the U.S. military to use a turbine-engine. It became one of the most prolific helicopters, a symbol of America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Although informally named 'Huey,' its official nickname is 'Iroquois.'"

It was designed with a stretched fuselage, so it could serve primarily as a troop carrier to replace the earlier CH-34 Choctaw in U.S. Army service. 2000 of these 'Iroquois D' variants were built, many of whom were converted to UH-1H standard with an upgraded, and more powerful engine."

The main rotor is powered by two turboshaft engines that drive a single output shaft. Should one engine fail the remaining engine can deliver 671 kW (900 shp) for 30 minutes or 571 kW (765 shp) enabling the UH-1N to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight. It was also one of the few 'Iroquois' variants not to be used by the U.S. Army, instead being the standard-bearer for the Marines. Its twin-engine configuration gave it the informal nickname 'Twin Huey.'"

With its triple-hook cargo system, the CH-47D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to 26,000 lb (12,000 kg) (such as 40-foot or 12-metre containers) externally. It was first introduced into service in 1979. In air assault operations, it often serves as the principal mover of the 155 mm M198 howitzer, accompanying 30 rounds of ammunition, and an 11-man crew."
