 PRC_Suppress_Counterrevolutionaries_categories_desc:0 "After the founding of the New China, counterrevolutionaries are still very active because of our unfavourable repression.\nLandlords and old rich peasants are organising home-going legion in remote areas to carry out counter-attacks; bandits and secret agents are attacking roads and railways, killing cadres, and destroying industrial and agricultural production; the Huidongmen organisations are operating in the rural areas, propagating their reactionary and superstitious doctrines; and the Kuomintang's latent forces are also stirring up trouble in the shadows, attempting to overthrow the people's power in collusion with the US imperialists.\nNow that Suppress Counterrevolutionaries Campaign is being waged nationwide like a violent storm, we must completely dismantle these counterrevolutionaries with a thunderbolt, in order to maintain the people's peace and social stability and to consolidate the new-born people's power."
 PRC_Land_Reform_categories_desc:0 "Landlords and squires have been the local ruling class in rural townships throughout China's long feudal history, and have been one of the root causes of modern China's decadence and backwardness, and of the people's misery. In order to purge the reactionary rule of the landlords and squires at the local level and to liberate the peasants who are enslaved and exploited by the landlords, land reform is imperative.\n As early as 1947, the Central Committee of the CPC, on the basis of the lessons learnt from the previous land work in the countryside, started a land reform movement in the liberated areas, and formulated the Outline of China's Land Law, which stipulated:'Abolish the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system, and implement a land system in which the ploughman is entitled to his share of the land'. Later, in January 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the general line of land reform:'Relying on the poor peasants and uniting the middle peasants, we will eliminate the feudal system of exploitation and develop agricultural production in a systematic and separate manner'.\n Nowadays, there are still more than 300 million peasants in China under the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class. As the Kuomintang army collapsed too rapidly, the vast number of newly liberated areas had not been able to carry out land reforms in time. Along with the land reform, the rule of the rural landlords would be gradually dismantled, the peasants would have their own plots of land, and the people's democratic regime would be fully extended to the rural areas."
 PRC_Socialist_Transformation_categories_desc:0 "Socialist transformation is the three major transformation programmes established to bring the country to the socialist stage, which seeks to socialise the three economic dimensions of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.\n The transformation programme for agriculture is modelled on the Soviet Union's establishment of the cooperative system, which divides agricultural cooperativisation into three major stages, namely, mutual aid societies, primary societies, and advanced societies, and laid down China's agricultural socialist course. The method of transformation of handicrafts is also the same as that of agriculture.\n The transformation of industry and commerce is to gradually transform capitalist private enterprises into socialist enterprises under the ownership of the whole people by means of state capitalism, and to distribute and solve the problem of private profits in accordance with the 'state income tax, enterprise provident fund, employees' welfare bonuses, and capital dividends and bonuses', endeavouring to achieve the following 'public-private partnership in all industries'.\n The Three Major Reforms will adapt our economic system to the needs of socialist industrialisation, and after the success of the reforms in all areas, we will move the whole country towards a new stage of socialism, and make tangible changes and innovations in people's lives. This will inevitably take time, but with the maturity of the administration, we can trust the ability of our cadres..."
