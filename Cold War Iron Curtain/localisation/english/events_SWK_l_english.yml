Article 10 explicitly permits and encourages the formation of political clubs and parties, provided they respect Sarawak's institutions and laws. This clause aims to foster a vibrant political culture while maintaining the integrity of the state's governance. Article 11, however, takes a firm stance against communism, declaring it outlawed within all territories of Sarawak and among its people for as long as the current government remains in power. This reflects the Dominion’s ongoing commitment to countering the spread of communist ideologies in the region, particularly in light of the rising threat from neighboring mainland territories under communist influence."

 SWK.7.d:0 "The United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the leading political party in former Malaya, has formally established a branch in Sarawak, marking a significant development in the country’s evolving political landscape. UMNO, known for championing Malay rights and the broader Bumiputra (indigenous Malayan-ness) identity, is now seeking to extend its influence across the South China Sea to Sarawak, a region with its unique ethnic and cultural composition. UMNO’s expansion into Sarawak is driven by a strategic goal: to repatriate Tunku Abdul Rahman, the former Prime Minister of Malaya, and to position him as the Prime Minister of Sarawak. The party believes that under Tunku’s leadership, Sarawak could be steered towards a stronger sense of unity among the indigenous populations by establishing the East Malayan Union as modeled after the former Malayan Union in mainland before the recent Communist takeover , guided by the principles of "Ketuanan Melayu" (Malay Supremacy), which advocates of spreading “ Malayan-ness “ to all inhabitants in Borneo and together struggle to liberate and free Communist-held mainland."

 SWK.12.d:0 "In response to rising communist activity and the threat of insurgency in Sarawak, British authorities implemented the Briggs Plan, a strategy first devised during the Malayan Emergency. The plan aimed to sever the ties between communist guerrillas and rural populations by forcibly resettling civilians into strategically secured "New Villages." In Sarawak, this involved the relocation of several thousand rural residents, mainly from ethnic Chinese communities, into fortified settlements with restricted movement and military oversight.\n\nThe British administration sought to win over the relocated civilians by providing basic amenities such as education, healthcare, electricity, and water within these villages. However, the forced nature of the relocations and the strict surveillance measures led to criticism and resentment. While the Briggs Plan was intended to cut off support for the insurgents and stabilize the region, it also contributed to heightened ethnic tensions and long-term social divisions within Sarawak."

 SWK_MLA_Response.1.d:0 "Our Sarawak government has been deeply shaken by the recent declaration of the false "People's Democratic Union of Malaya" by Chin Peng and the Malayan Communist Party. The news of this new regime has cast a dark shadow over the region, as Sarawakian leaders mourn the rise of a Communist state on the Malayan mainland. The establishment of the People's Democratic Union is seen as a tragic turn of events, undermining hopes for a peaceful and unified Southeast Asia. Sarawak's leadership views this development with sorrow, recognizing the suffering and repression that could befall the people of Malaya under the new Communist regime.

This aggressive strategy, aimed at targeting and destroying key infrastructure and ports in Communist-controlled People’s Democratic Union of Malaya, is seen as a serious threat to the stability and progress achieved by the Malayan National Liberation Armed Forces. The plan’s intent to disrupt supply lines and weaken the Malayan People's Democratic Union's defenses has raised alarms within the party, which views this move as a dangerous escalation by Sarawak in their attempt to undermine the Communist movement in Southeast Asia."

The plan authorizes targeted raids on key Red Malayan installations to disrupt their supply lines and prevent any future attempts to invade Borneo. This preemptive measure, named after the Javanese sea goddess, reflects the Sarawak government's determination to protect its territory and maintain stability in the region amidst the growing communist threat.

Designed by renowned architect Malay T. Y. Lee, this modernist structure uniquely blends traditional Sarawak and Malayan architectural elements with the clean, symbolic blocks inspired by Le Corbusier’s designs. The design is not only functional but also deeply symbolic—when viewed from a distance, the building resembles a rising Hornbill, Sarawak's state bird, symbolizing the state's aspirations. The new addition underscores Sarawak’s commitment to modern governance while honoring its rich cultural heritage."

 SWK_Rahman.1.d:0 "Our Government of Sarawak has officially declared the creation of the East Malayan Union, a Pan-Malayan Federation modeled after Tunku Abdul Rahman’s aspirations and the principles of UMNO’s Ketuanan Melayu (Malay Supremacy). This new union, aiming to consolidate the region’s Malay identity, will soon integrate the Dominion of North Borneo and the Sultanate of Brunei into its fold.\nUnder this model, the East Malayan Union seeks to establish a unified government that emphasizes Malay culture, identity, and leadership, as inspired by the former Malayan Union before the Communist takeover of the mainland. The union will not only fortify the defense of Borneo but also ensure that the region maintains a Malay-dominated socio-political framework.
