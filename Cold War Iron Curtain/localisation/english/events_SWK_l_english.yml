UMNO’s expansion into Sarawak is driven by a strategic goal: to repatriate Tunku Abdul Rahman, the former Prime Minister of Malaya, and to position him as the Prime Minister of Sarawak. The party believes that under Tunku’s leadership, Sarawak could be steered towards a stronger sense of unity among the indigenous populations by establishing the East Malayan Union as modeled after the former Malayan Union in mainland before the recent Communist takeover , guided by the principles of "Ketuanan Melayu" (Malay Supremacy), which advocates of spreading “ Malayan-ness “ to all inhabitants in Borneo and together struggle to liberate and free Communist-held mainland."
