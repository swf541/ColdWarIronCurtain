 KOR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M1 Garand is a grand weapon designed by John C. Garand in 1928 for the United States. The M1 Garand is a .30 caliber semi-automatic rifle that saw extensive use during WWII. It is amongst the first weapons to use a gas reloading system to rechamber a new round after firing. It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US.."

 KOR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

 KOR_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "K-2"
 KOR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Daewoo K2 series assault rifle is the standard assault rifle of the South Korean Army. The weapon shares some outward and inward similarities with the American M16 and includes functions of the Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 as well.\nThe K2 sports clean lines typical of Daewoo products and bears a resemblance to the American AR-18/Colt M16 automatic rifles. Essentially, the K2 is an M16 in nature but with the proven gas system of the Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle. As such, the Korean design does away with the direct impingement system and gas fouling inherent in the Stoner-based M16 line. The K2 makes use of standard M16 STANAG curved magazines and fires the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge from a 20- or 30-round magazine."
