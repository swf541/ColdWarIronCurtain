 KOR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M1 Garand is a grand weapon designed by John C. Garand in 1928 for the United States. The M1 Garand is a .30 caliber semi-automatic rifle that saw extensive use during WWII. It is amongst the first weapons to use a gas reloading system to rechamber a new round after firing. It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US.."

 KOR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common. The KM16A1 is the liscensed version in Korea."

 KOR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Daewoo K2 series assault rifle is the standard assault rifle of the South Korean Army. The weapon shares some outward and inward similarities with the American M16 and includes functions of the Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 as well.\nThe K2 sports clean lines typical of Daewoo products and bears a resemblance to the American AR-18/Colt M16 automatic rifles. Essentially, the K2 is an M16 in nature but with the proven gas system of the Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle. As such, the Korean design does away with the direct impingement system and gas fouling inherent in the Stoner-based M16 line. The K2 makes use of standard M16 STANAG curved magazines and fires the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge from a 20- or 30-round magazine."

It looks like an AR-15/M4A1 upgrade by name, but it's actually a copy.\nColt (then known as Colt Firearms), which lost production rights to the M16A2 assault rifle to FN after a five-year strike from 1985, was in financial trouble to file for bankruptcy protection in 1992, but fortunately, two years later, in 1994, M4 Carvin was able to revive.\n\nHowever, because they did not have the facilities to handle mass production, they also entrusted orders to other gun companies, which included Bushmaster, who produced the M4 for military delivery. Since then, its products under the M4 name, which have been independently improved, have been exported to the Korea Coast Guard.\n\nThe model exported to Korea is a type called the M4-Type. It is the main cause of the Colt's lawsuit and a successful export as well as civilian acceptance. There are M4A2 and M4A3 as derivatives, and the derivatives exported to Korea are M4A3."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."
