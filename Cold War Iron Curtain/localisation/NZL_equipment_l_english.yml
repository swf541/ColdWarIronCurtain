 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

The weapons were manufactured by the Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield, Birmingham Small Arms, Royal Ordnance Factory and ROF Fazakerley. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by Parker Hale Limited. The SLR served the British Armed Forces from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the L85A1 from 1985 onwards."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."
