 LEB_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "MAS-36"
 LEB_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The MAS-36 is a bolt action rifle designed in 1927 chambered in 7.62x54mm French cartridge, and was adopted by the French military in 1936 as a replacement for the Berthier and Lebel service rifles. It saw service during the Second World War in limited numbers, but due to mass production after the war ended it would see service in numerous conflicts by many different nations. Post WWII produced rifles saw some upgrades in terms of ergonomics. It even saw some variants that saw the addition of an attachable rifle grenade and a marksman model. She was expected to only be an interim rifle, built on machinery that could be used to build anticipated self-loading rifles"

 LEB_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "M16"
 LEB_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Carbine was noted to be vastly outclassed by the AK47 and the German StG44 by US military officials and in 1956 the development of the M16 began. In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

 LEB_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "M16A2"
 LEB_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "After the frequent unreliability of the weapon in the jungles of Vietnam, the US marine corps requested a redesign of the weapon. In 1982 the redesign and improvements were made. The weapon featured a strengthened receiver, new rifling, a strengthened case, better cooling as a result of different materials, improved support for attachables, and a redesigned internal mechanism that gave it a high level of reliability. It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

 LEB_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Carbine, Caliber 5.56 mm, M4 "
 LEB_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "M4 Carbine"
 LEB_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M4 carbine is a further improvement on the M16A2. It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
