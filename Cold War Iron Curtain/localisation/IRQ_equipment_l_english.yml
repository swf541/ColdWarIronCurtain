 IRQ_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "SMLE No. 4"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

 IRQ_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "AK-47"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 IRQ_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Zastava M70-B1"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Zastava M70-B1"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Development of a domestic assault rifle began in 1959 by Zastava with the M59 and M64 series of rifles with milled receivers, threaded barrels, familiar Zastava handguards, gas cutoffs for grenade launching, and several other diversities from the mainstay AK design, such as a bolt hold open device on the right side of the receiver, and a charging handle that appeared different from other AK models. Though performances were satisfactory, the Yugoslav military did not adopt the rifle at the time for various reasons.\n\nIn 1970, green light was given to begin army-funded mass production of the M70 and M70A series (Automatska Puska Model 1970, \"Automatic Rifle Model 1970\") of which the M70A was the folding stock version. Over time, several cost-efficiency production measures were implemented, such as removal of the internal bolt hold open and replacing milled receivers with stamped steel, first 0.9mm and later thicker 1.5mm."

 IRQ_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Avtomat Kalashnikova 1974 Modernizirovanniy"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "AK-74M"
 IRQ_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-74M is an improved variant of the AK-74 developed in 1991 by the Izhmash factory. The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."

Subsequently, it also equipped Canadian, Australian, South African, Polish and Indian regiments, and after the war, it was also used by New Zealand. In the Second World War the normal organisation was a regiment of 16 guns organised into two batteries. The 5.5 was retained in service after the war. It was used by the Royal Artillery on operations in Korea, South Arabia and Borneo. It was probably used by the Indian Army in wars against Pakistan, and was used by the Pakistan Army against India in the mountains of Kashmir during the Kargil War of 1999."
