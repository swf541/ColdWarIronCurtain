 Samoan_Proposal.1.d:0 "The Pentagon recently presented a new proposal to deal with the Korean refugee crisis. Jeju is very vulnerable to communist aggression, any attempt to strengthen a government in exile could result in renewed conflict with us at the disadvantage. The Pentagon wishes to turn Samoa into the main base for a democratic Korean government in exile. Korean refugees can also be resettled there. Samoa offers a safe base, in the Pacific, from which a future liberation campaign can be waged."
 Samoan_Proposal.2.d:0 "The United States wishes to relocate our government in exile and refugees to Samoa. They promise us extensive autonomy. Samoa is in the Pacific and safety away from communist forces. Our military and political experts note we can rebuild our forces and built our legitimacy without the fear of communist interference. The reality of our circumstances mean even if we do not like the proposal, we cannot really disagree."
 Samoan_Proposal.3.d:0 "The situation in Korea has deteriorated to the point that the United States and its allies are only in control of the island of Jeju. The Korean government wishes that to maintain the island as a forward base for its government in exile. Some in the United States believe they should control the island as an outpost to halt further communist aggression. A US occupation would likely antagonize all parties in the region. A weak Korean occupation could easily be overrun. However, we could look over the territory and protect it as a true Asian bastion against communism. The Foreign Minister will make the request."
 Samoan_Proposal.4.d:0 "The Japanese government requested we give the island of Jeju for their occupation. The Japanese see themselves as the strongest democratic power left in the region who should receive the responsibility. The Korean government wishes to keep control of the island as a forward position and symbol of their continued presence in the peninsula. Our senior commanders on the ground believe we should control the territory to prevent its fall. A Japanese or American occupation could cause unrest and concerns about colonialism. However, the Korean government is still very vulnerable. A decision must be made."
 Samoan_Proposal.5.d:0 "The United States and Korean government agreed to cede the administration of Jeju to our nation. We will take this responsibility to preserve a bastion of democracy on the Korean Peninsula. There is already criticism towards us and the United States consisting of baseless claims we are bringing in a colonial regime. Without our presence the people of Jeju face brutal communist occupation. The people of Japan stands with the suppressed Korean people and will take the solemn responsibility of preserving Jeju."
 Samoan_Proposal.6.d:0 "The United States unfortunately rejected our proposal to oversee Jeju. The Americans noted the Koreans and Chinese would likely be incensed by such an action. They also raised concerns about such an occupation may cause a remilitarization of our nation. These concerns are obviously baseless as we sought to act as a shield and democratic bastion. Despite this short sighted decision, we must remain steadfast and committed to confronting communism in East Asia. The communist threat remains dangerous and potent."
 Samoan_Proposal.7.d:0 "The United States confirmed it would cede the administration and occupation of Jeju to Japan. The Japanese welcomed the move, claiming it stands ready to make its stand to halt the threat of communist aggression in the region. By giving Jeju to Japan the Americans are likely hoping to minimize its own commitment to the region and ensure the island is under a powerful, friendly Asian power. Japan is expected to prevent further communist Korean aggression. Jeju remains the last territory of Korea not under communist rule following the successful North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Chinese and Korean government condemned the decision, calling it a return to brutal Japanese imperialism."
 Samoan_Proposal.8.d:0 "The United States confirmed it would remain the administrative power in Jeju. The American military believes its presence in Jeju will save this last bastion of democratic Korea protected. Although the South Korean and Japanese government both welcomed the news, there are reports of public protests. Protestors accuse the United States of expanding a colonial regime in the region. The communist Korean and Chinese states both condemned American imperialism. American politicians largely welcomed the move as necessary though some did question the continued commitment of American resources to a lost Korea."
 Samoan_Proposal.9.d:0 "The United States Navy confirmed thousands of Korean refugees fleeing communist occupation are currently being transported to Samoa. This is the first wave as the American government plans to move as many refugees as possible. Senior surviving South Korean civil and military leaders are already in Samoa. They are establishing a government of exile and an administrative structure to oversee the arriving refugees. Their is concern among Koreans and other American allies that the new government in Samoa may be too far away or isolated to effect change in Korea. However, the United States insists a base in Samoa offers the best access while maintaining the security of the democratic Korea forces."
 Samoan_Proposal.10.d:0 "The Republic of Korea opened its first session of a new National Assembly in Samoa. Inaugurating the beginning of its new government in exile following the communist takeover of South Korea. The session saw leading military and civil leaders promise to help settle refugees in Samoa and begin preparing for a campaign of national liberation. Much thanks was given to the United States for facilitating the establishment of a capital in Samoa. Although American allies were quick to congratulate the Korean government, the news is being widely mocked in socialist states. The communist Korean government condemned the Samoa regime as American puppets with no comprehension of reality."

 FRAkorea.4.d:0 "In an effort to support the democratically-elected South Korean regime and support her American allies, the French government has sent a battalion sized volunteer force to aid South Korea against the Soviet and Chinese backed North Korea. According to various sources, it will be comprised of more than 3500 troops, with both volunteer and reserve forces. It will be led by Lieutenant General Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, one of France's most decorated war heroes during WW2. With the addition of France in this small scale conflict in East Asia, observers point out that it could lead to an escalation of Cold War tensions, and can bring NATO and the Soviet Union into direct military conflict."
 korea.47.d:0 "Amidst a global climate of discontent towards authority and a national distaste toward the South Korean government, the embers of protest flared there this year. For the past two years, the people of South Korea have been growing ever more resentful of their president, Syngman Rhee, in office since 1948. In 1958, fearing a loss of power, President Rhee forced a shift in the nation's laws that expanded executive power extensively. The following year, Rhee's two largest political rivals for the 1960 presidential election died under suspicious circumstances and one of his closest political allies was elected vice president by fraudulent vote, leading to widespread rumors of Rhee maintaining power by blood and intrigue. This year Koreans announced they'd had enough. What began as a small protest by the Democratic Party exploded in scale after the police killed a student protestor, with a tear gas shell. As protests swelled throughout April, outnumbered soldiers and police fought a losing battle before finally refusing to fire on the marchers. Left at the mercy of his electorate, Rhee was quick to step down and flee the country. The people of South Korea now look to reorganize their republic on a parliamentary model, hoping to curb the power of the executive and ensure that no more corrupt strongmen seize the reins of power."
 korea.48.d:0 "The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to pass resolution 82 in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Soviet Union did not attend the meeting as they are boycotting the Security Council so could not veto. Of the present security council members, only Yugoslavia chose to abstain. The resolution condemns the North Korean invasion and call on member states to assist South Korea and refrain from arming or supporting North Korea. The United State and its allies are heralding the resolution as a major diplomatic victory and analysts believe it will pave the way for more direct American involvement in the conflict. For many member states, especially the United States and Western Europe, there is sympathy to the South Koreans as the memories of World War II and the surprise attacks by the Axis powers remain embedded in the collective memory of its leaders."
 sov.100.d:0 "Since the Berlin Blockade of 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union have been at odds, undermining one another through proxy wars, shows of force, and sabotage. However, in light of the sudden Arab-Israeli war, American president Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin met in Glassboro, New Jersey to discuss the relations of their opposing countries. Over the course of three days, Kosygin and Johnson discussed the crisis in the Middle East, a solution to the ongoing Vietnam war, and limiting the ongoing arms race between America and the Soviet Union. Though no significant agreement was reached, the amicable atmosphere of the summit has frequently been called the "Spirit of Glassboro". This Spirit has many on both sides hoping for closer and friendlier ties between the rival nations."
 sov.101.d:0 "Lightning cracked through the Kremlin today as a Soviet Parade was fired upon by a pistol-wielding assailant. The gunman, Viktor Illyin, has been identified as an AWOL Red Army conscript. He opened fired on a Soviet motorcade passing through Moscow while disguised as a policeman. According to investigators, the assassin was disgruntled at being forcefully conscripted into the Red Army, and had been psychologically affected by the Soviet Union's recent Policy of aggression towards Czechoslovakia. The driver of the motorcar, Ilya Zharkov, was killed in the crossfire, and the cars occupants, renowned cosmonauts of the Soviet Space Program, Alexey Leonov, Valentina Tereshkova, Georgy Beregovoy and Andrian Nikolayev, sustained only minor injuries, the intended target of the assassination, Premier Leonard Brezhnev, whilst present within the motorcade, managed to escape the attempt on his life unharmed. In response to this act of domestic terrorism, the Russian Government has issued an immediate press ban on all mentions relating to the attempt on Brezhnev's life."
 SKnews.4.d:0 "Earlier this morning in Seoul, an assassination attempt against Chang Myon failed. A sniper in the Sigong building attacked the Vice President and he received a penetrating wound to the wrist. Immediately, security forces moved to shield Chang Myon and chase the sniper. The sniper attempted to flee but was arrested. Chang Myon is currently in the hospital seeing to his injuries and an investigation is being mounted. The primary suspect to the incident is the Liberal Party who are the only ones who may desire to kill the vice president. The attack has been publicly condemned by supporters and members of the liberal party."
 SKnews.2.d:0 "Cho Bang-am, the former Progressive Party candidate, has been found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death. After his first trial failed to accrue enough evidence to convict him several months ago, a more recent trial had found conclusive evidence that Cho Bang-am had been funded by North Korea. The evidence that Cho Bang-am has been conspiring against South Korea has led to increased tensions between the 2 nations. Already, there is public outrage and fear that North Korea may make another attempt to infiltrate the South Korean government. The heightened state of affairs has led to an increased state of awareness in the country and additional funding to audit systems."
 SKnews.1.d:0 "For more than half a millenia, the Korean Peninsula was ruled by a dynasty similar to its neighbor to the north, the Yi Dynasty. However, thanks to inefficient bureaucracy, corruption, and the weakening power of its Qing protectors, the Yi Dynasty was deposed from their rule, and was replaced by the local administration of the Empire of Japan. However, hope for monarchism and the restoration of the Yi Dynasty has been restored, for the Yi Dynasty was able to overthrow the provisional government placed by the United States and overseen by Syngman Rhee and restore their imperial rule over the Southern half of the Korean Peninsula. This chain of events in the Korean Peninsula is unprecedented, and the United States have yet to respond, but are likely to support the monarchist rule. However, the DPRK or North Korea doesn't seemed pleased, and have mobilized more troops to the DMZ to ensure its security."
 SKnews.5.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea have ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was assassinated today . According to police, Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and shot him 4 times. According to Ahn, he claims that he has sole responsibility for the assassination, claiming it was done of his own fruition, and that no other party played a role in Kim Koo's assassination. He also stated that Kim Koo is allegedly a collaborator with the Soviet Union, and that his presence in South Korea serves as a breeding ground for rebellion and insurgency. However, observers believe otherwise, and they speculate that the assassination attempt was actually orchestrated by the Rhee administration itself in an effort to consolidate power and influence throughout the Republic. Nevertheless, this assassination will be a stain in the Rhee administration's reputation."
 SKnews.3.d:0 "A period of both national and international uproar has occurred today, as recent evidence has came to light that government forces have organized mass slaughter of civilians in the Republic of Korea. The massacres, organized none other than by the Rhee administration itself, have claimed that these massacres are necessary since the victims are communist sympathizers, people who would institute a revolution if they weren't sacrificed for the nation. Such rhetoric hasn't convinced the people of South Korea or the world rather, with condemnation coming from various nations, with the United States, the sole backer of South Korea, have yet to respond. This act is thought by observers as something that has reinvigorated opposition to the Rhee administration, not acceptance of it."
 SKnews.6.d:0 "Democracy is slowly fading to the abyss in the young republic, as President Syngman Rhee has extended term limits for his office, eventually paving the way for an authoritarian regime. While extending term limits is considered by many as nothing since they could simply lose an election, the fact is that the extended term limits coupled with allegations of election fraud have been seen by many observers as a dictatorship. While the Rhee administration hasn't given out an official statement as to why they extended term limits, it is perfectly clear that Syngman Rhee will use this to consolidate his position in South Korea, and ensure opposition to his regime is manageable or even non-existent."
