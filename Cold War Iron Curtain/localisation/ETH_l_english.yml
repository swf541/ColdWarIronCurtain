 eth50.1.d:0 "Ever since the Haile Selassie has come to age, Ethiopia has had a wide and extensive outreach of foreign relations with Europe. Starting in the 1920s when Haile Selassie, then Ras Tafari, went on a diplomatic journey to the cities of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, and Athens. During the Italo-Ethiopian War and the Second World war, Haile Selassie lead a government in exile in London while having strong relations with the allied nations. Since independence Ethiopia has continued this policy with Haile Selassie being seen around Europe as charismatic, likeable, and an eccentric diplomatic leader."
 eth50.3.d:0 "Ethiopia is in a difficult position following World War II and the second Italo-Ethiopian War. With a new Italian government having undertermined relations with Ethiopia, and British Hegemony evermore undisputed on the fronteir of Ethiopia's borders, the future of Ethiopian interest is unclear. Talks in the United Nations decolonization committee discuss the idea of Eritrea joining with Ethiopia in a federation; some are believing the bordering nation of the Somalian Mandate should be brought closer to independence"
 eth50.5.d:0 "The U.N. Central Committee last week spent fourty-minutes of its delegation opening scolding the Ethiopian administration over recent territorial aquistions.

 eth50.8.d:0 "Today, Haile Selassie with oversight of the imperial council, has signed into legislation the Federal act of 1952. The act offically initiates the transfer of Eritrea from British to Ethiopian control. While the chief executive of Eritrea is feeling the pressure of the Imperial Crown, the overall mood in Eritrea is initially positive."
 eth50.9.d:0 "Tedla Bairu, the first chief executive Eritrea has resigned last week in response to the policy towards Eritreans within the Ethiopian Empire. The Adis Abeba administration has dissolved the Eritrean constitution, banned the official use of the Eritrean and Arabic languages; and discouraged islamic minorities from practicing. Asfaha Woldemikael, his replacement has shown a much more status quo pro-amharic viewpoint in his local municipal office which has lead to his appointment as the Eritrean Chief Executive."
 eth50.10.d:0 "In keeping with the principle of collective security, for which Haile Selassie is an outspoken proponent, Ethiopia has sent a contingent under General Mulugeta Buli and Kebbede Guebre, known as the Kagnew Battalion, to take part in the Korean War. It was attached to the American 7th Infantry Division, and will be participating in major engagements."

 eth50.12.d:0 "The Ethiopian delegation to Rome was met with a somber response while agreements were made to pay the presented bill to the Economic Commission for Italy of £184,746,023 for damages inflicted during the course of the Italian occupation.

His Imperial Majesty (now accompanied by prominent Rastafari figures) then continued his time in Jamaica by partaking in several cermonies around the city; from a visit to the Prime Minister's palace to the recieving of an honorary doctorate at the University of the West Indies. However, the most monumentous ceromony was that of his meeting with the the key figures of the Rastafari Cult, which will go down as a legendary event in history for the followers of the movement. Throughout the African diaspora in the West Indies the Rastafaris are now legitimized and taken seriously as their prophet, Haile Selassie showed them affection. Despite this literal worship of Haile Selassie by those who claim he is the second coming of Jesus Christ, his imperial majesty insisted to them that he is "an ordinary man", something that changed little in their mind."

 newseth60.2.d:0 "Today marked the formation of the OAU, the Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia along with its 32 signatory governments. The main objective of the formation was announced to bring the African nations together, and to bring total eradication of both colonialism and neo-colonialism within the continent. During the first conference which took place on the 1st of May, the leading Gambian nationalist Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof delivered a speech of heavy anti-colonisation as he spoke, “I therefore adjure that you ignore any suggestion outside Africa and holding that the present civilization, which some of the big powered are boasting of, sprang up from Africa, and realising that the entire world has something earthly to learn from Africa.” The world now awaits to see what this new union can bring to the continent."
 eth60.3.d:0 "Taking advantage of the Emperor's trip, this morning, a false emergency meeting was called where Ethiopian Coup plotters lead by the generals Mengistu Neway, Mulugeta Buli, and the local governor Garmame Neway took key figures such as Prime Minister Abbebe Aregai hostage."
 eth60.4.d:0 "The following hours have been brutal on these plotters as Mulugeta Buli tries to maintain the loyalty of the military forces to support the coup. The actions they take in securing this loyalty will decide the fate of Ethiopia forever"
 eth60.5.d:0 "The Prince Asfaw Wossen, son of Haile Selassie gave a controversial speech this week, from the usurper controlled capital. Punctuating the speech was a bold proclomation for the future of Ethiopia. Attacking the weakneses and shortcomings of the government in addressing the issues plaguing the impoverished masses of the rural country. Claiming a bright future under a constitutional monarchy lead by the prince with a new cabinet of progressive figures where the common Ethiopian was no longer forgotten. While most foreign observers viewed the prince as being ungenuine and simply speaking under the pressure of his captors, the local student youth and intelligencia came out into the city square assembling in praise."
 eth60.6.d:0 "Forces under Mared Mangesha in cover of heavy machine guns, reconaissance planes, light tanks, and a large infantry platoon stormed the capital center this afternoon. With many of the plotters dying in combat the two main organizers, the Neway brothers, in a last moment of cowardice killed their hostages including the Prime Minister and Italo-Ethiopian War veteran - Abebe Aregai. Suprisingly in their desperate attempt to escape the two killed their fellow plotter Mulugeti Bulli in a dispute. While able to flee the capital city initially Germame Neway and Mengistu Neway were found in a nearby town of Mojo. While Germame Neway committed suicide before his capture, Mengistu was taken alive and hung soon after."
 eth60.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister Abebe Aregai, though able to easily fool large Italian divisons in our nation's war a decade ago was not able workout his situation with the coup plotters and has been fully restrained in his hostage role.

 eth60.8.d:0 "With the Air Force and Tank divisions of the nation declaring loyalty to the coup, the nation's monarchy has been de-facto usurped. While its unclear what exact change of administration the coup plotters will attempt at first, it is clear that country of Ethiopia will be drastically changed in the next decade for better or worst. While the student youth and intelligencia are estatic, organizing mass celebrations throughout the main cities of Ethiopia, the rural nobility are slowly getting news of the coup and preparing for the worst. As the rural illiterate peasantry have no access to information outside of the estate they work on, their landlords are fearful of their future and will begin doing whatever they can to hold on to their feudal properties."
 eth60.9.d:0 "Envoys from Adis Abeba have repeatedly been bringing intimidating talks from the nation's administrators. The local parliment of Eritrea created by the U.N. resolution making it a possesion under the Ethiopian crown has been continously sidelined with the regions administrators beginning to think their positions will soon become irrelavent."

 eth60.13.d:0 "The Chief of the Armed Forces, Mulugeti Bulli has staged a military backed coup today in the capital. Famed as an Italo-Ethiopian war general who lead the Ethiopian expeditionaries in the Korean War has been in prominence in the new administration ever since the 1960 coup d'etat.

 eth60.19.d:0 "In the face of rising Pan-Africanist personalities in Africa like Nkrumah, Nyrerer, and Kenyatta, Haile Selassie is more so trying to expand his foreign image and diplomacy. How he will respond to future world events will certainly draw the eye of foreign analyists"
