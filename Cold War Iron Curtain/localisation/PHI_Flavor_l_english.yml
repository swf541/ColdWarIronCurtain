 #Huks Insurgency Decisions
 Huks_Insurgency_Decisions:0 "Hukbalahap Insurgency Decisions"
 Huks_Insurgency_Decisions_desc:0 "During World War II, socialist and communist activists formed a peasant guerilla army called the Hukbalahap or Huks to battle occupying Japanese forces. Despite raising many fighters and playing a role in the liberation of the Philippines, the Philippine government has actively sought to forcibly disarm the Huks, arrest its members, and refuses to accept their elected candidates to the government. Citing the continued refusal of the government to end its crackdown or address the concerns of the peasants, the Huks squadrons have reactivated to wage a guerilla revolutionary war against the government.\n\nHukbalahap Strength: [?ROOT.huks_insurgency]%"

 HUK_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "Since the Huks started their campaign against the government, they have launched vicious attacks on pro-government villagers and officials. The terroristic attacks in particular have turned many people against them, including among the peasants who the Huks claim to fight for. Our intelligence agents recently recruited a small network of peasant sympathizers in an area who have provided us with the names of prominent villagers supporting the enemy along with the location of Huk squadrons in the area. With this information we were able to deploy Battalion Combat Team to root out the rebels, detain their supporters, and occupy pro-rebel villages. More operations like this will ensure the end of these rebels."
 HUK_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Since the Huks started their campaign against the government, they have launched vicious attacks on pro-government villagers and officials. The terroristic attacks in particular have turned many people against them, including among the peasants who the Huks claim to fight for. Our intelligence agents recently recruited a small network of peasant sympathizers in an area who have provided us with the names of prominent villagers supporting the enemy along with the location of Huk squadrons in the area. With this information a Battalion Combat Team moved in to target the rebels, capture their supporters and occupy enemy villages. However, our forces faced ambushes when confronting the rebels and the peasants detained proved to be either pro-government or neutral. More significantly, the villages occupied were also neutral. It appears the informants were working for the Huks and the operation only ended up bolstering Huk support in the area."
 HUK_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A Battalion Combat Team (BCT) identified Huk rebels targeting villages in the area. The troops were able to identify the village being used as a base. After the area was properly scouted the commanding officer moved the troops into position. When the order was given, the village was assaulted. The Huk squadron was easily rooted out and destroyed. The village structures used by the rebels were also destroyed to punish their supporters. In addition, the BCT seized enemy weapons, documents, and supplies. The BCT commander did an excellent job utilizing his unit to neutralize the enemy forces. The strategy of using these smaller sized units is definitely bearing fruit."
 HUK_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "A Battalion Combat Team (BCT) operating in an area with several Huk squadrons operating attempted to launch a sweep operation to clear out rebel fighters. However, the commander spread his forces a bit thin to cover more ground and the rebels, adept at guerrilla warfare due to their experiences against the Japanese, took advantage. We failed to destroy any rebel presence and some of the men who were too isolated fell into enemy ambushes. The BCT force returned to their base but the failure of the operation has hurt morale and shaken the confidence of the soldiers in their officers. More significantly, Huk fighters in the area are operating more openly than before."
 HUK_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "Our Air Force is eager to showcase their abilities after the reforms launched after the end of World War II and the Japanese occupation. A rebel Huk command center was recently identified in a local village. The Air Force dispatched several fighters who conducting a close air strike, targeting rebel fighters around the village and the command center itself. Intercepted communications confirm we destroyed the center, including a senior rebel leader. The rebel fighters in the village also took losses, we hope this will erode that squadron from continuing to operate against our forces. This was a major success for the Air Force."
 HUK_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Our Air Force is eager to showcase their abilities after the reforms launched after the end of World War II and the Japanese occupation. A rebel Huk squadron was identified operating near a village. The Air Force dispatched several fighters who struck the village and the area around it of suspected fighters. However, although the strikes were a success, it appears the Huk fighters were not in the area at the time. Instead the planes ended up hitting the village and accidentally targeted villagers. News of the strike has alienated the villages in the area and helped enemy propaganda that we do not care for peasants, this will no doubt be a boost to the Huks who will gain more public support and recruits now."

 HUK_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Huks revealed their true identity as bandits and thugs with their violent assaults on unarmed villages and terroristic assassinations. These operations began to turn the people, and more importantly the peasants they hid amongst against them. Our own forces initially made several mistakes in their approach but overtime the Battalion Combat Teams adapted their tactics and increasingly avoided alienating the people. We began to destroy many Huk squadrons and alienate them from the peasants, pushing them into isolated jungles. Finally, we were able to organize a major offensive against these remaining Huk forces, defeating them piecemeal and capturing their senior leaders. As of now the Huks are no longer a cohesive force and the senior leaders we have captured have agreed to surrender to our forces. This is a great victory for the Philippine government and people."
 HUK_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "During World War II, the Hukbalahap were one of the largest anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in the country. Despite their services, the government, with American backing decided to forcibly disarm the Huks and this led them to declare war on the government for the rights of peasants. The government efforts to crush the rebels through military action ended up failing as Huk squadrons proved quite adept at fighting conventional tactics. In addition, some heavy-handed actions by government troops only alienated the peasants who grew more and more sympathetic to the Huk cause. Overtime, as public support grew, the ranks of the Huks expanded and village protests greatly thinned government forces. With people in the city joining the protests, the government position proved untenable and they recently announced they were capitulating to the Hukbalahap and their demands for peasant rights."

 PHI_Flavor.1.d:0 "Reports breaking out of Manila suggesting that Filipino President Ramon Magsaysay has died in result of a plane crash on the island of Cebu which has been confirmed by local authorities. Magsaysay, renowned for his guerilla movement against Japanese forces during the '40s and ardent anti-communist views was a polarizing figure in the Filipino Government. Locals in Cebu were questioned by authorities revealing the Filipino President's plane, a C-47, crashed into Mount Pinatubo in the early morning hours. Before the fatal accident from departing Cebu to return to Manila, Magsaysay was due to deliver speeches to three educational institutions on the island. Reports advise that 36 of the 56 aboard were lost in the crash. Estimations of an investigation timeline conducted by both Filipino and international experts could last anywhere between five-seven months."
