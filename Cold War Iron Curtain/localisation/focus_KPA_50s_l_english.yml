PWK.1.d:0 "The Korean Workers Party was officially announced following the merger of the Workers Party of North Korea with the Workers Party of South Korea. This latest act continues the consolidation of communist leadership around Kim Il-Sung. This comes after the recent Party Congress declared North Korea a bastion of democracy and approved a constitution establishing an independent, united Korea with Seoul as the capital. With one Party, it appears North Korea is finalizing its efforts to lay the groundwork for a unification of the Korean peninsula under communist rule."
PWK.2.d:0 "Observers of the North Korean Peoples Army (KPA) note with concern the recent building of a personality cult and extensive surveillance structure within the force. Loyalty appears focused on Kim Il-Sung and political officers are said to be very active in ensuring both loyalty and education in Marxist-Leninism. Brushing off such criticism, a senior North Korean official declared the KPA was being transformed into a disciplined, revolutionary force devoted to the people. And not a force enslaved by a dictator or bought by imperialist money."
KPA_Purge.3.d:0 "Korean nationalist Cho Man-sik was executed in Pyongyang. An ardent nationalist, many viewed him as a potential rival for power in North Korea. His execution is seen as a victory for Kim Il-Sung and his supporters. Cho Man-sik struggled to establish himself after World War II and his refusal to accept the trusteeship of the Korean peninsula cost him any potential Soviet backing. Cho Man-sik was well-known for his embrace of non-violent resistance to Japanese rule, but his failure to embrace Soviet ideals lead to his detention and eventual execution."
KPA_Purge.4.d:0 "In a rare public rebuke, reports have spread that Kim Il-Sung holds generals trained by the Chinese communists responsible for recent military setbacks. This is an open challenge to the Yanan Faction, which consists of the pro-Chinese communist Korean leaders. The group has strong ties with the Chinese communists and dominate the military leadership. Following these criticisms, Kim is expected to purge a number of these generals and replace them with his own loyalists. The Chinese communist leadership is said to be displeased with the situation."
KPA_Purge.5.d:0 "Reports from North Korea indicate Ho Ka-I has died of illness, though unofficial reports suggest he may have been executed during a power struggle. This is a major blow to the pro-Soviet faction within the communist party. Ho Ka-I, a Soviet Korean, rose to prominence following World War II as the Soviets identified him as a key organizer. He worked closely with Kim Il-Sung on purging enemies to the party and consolidating power, however, the two men recently had a falling out. Kim was said to accuse his former ally of seeking to turn North Korea into a mini-Soviet Union and of being focused solely on personal glory. His execution indicates Ho Ka-I and his faction likely lost the latest bout of internal strife among the North Korean communist leadership."
KPA_Purge.7.d:0 "Despite pleas from the United States and Soviet Union, the North Korean government announced it had executed Pak Hon-yong for espionage. Pak Hon-yong long championed the communist movement within Japanese occupied Korea, though he would eventually go into hiding until after World War II. He eventually setup the communist party in South Korea, though eventually he would be forced out of the country. In North Korea, he helped unite Korean communism under Kim Il-Sung and gained a senior position due to his influence in South Korea. However, the Korean War has seen a massive crackdown of South Korean communists, leading to massive crackdowns and deportations. With his position weakened and military victory unlikely, Pak Hon-yong lacked much political clout and was easily purged by Kim Il-Sung as he seeks to secure complete authority over Korean communism."
August_Faction.2.d:0 "A recent power struggle against Kim Il-Sung ended in failure. Senior leaders of the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions of the Korean communist leadership attempted to remove Kim from power. They planned to confront Kim at the next major Central Committee meeting and criticize him for failing to correct his leadership style following the de-Stalinization wave sweeping the communist world. Kim Il-Sung apparently discovered the plot and turned the tables on his rivals. He first delayed the meeting for a month and packed the audience with his loyalists. When the criticism began, the supporters of Kim shouted down the critics, foiling the plot. Afterwards, many pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese communist leaders were arrested. Kim Il-Sung announced plans for a new purge, indicating he may finally succeed in breaking all rival factions within the party."
August_Faction.3.d:0 "De-Stalinization is sweeping the communist world. Those communist leaders still committed to Stalinism, especially the cult of personality and consolidation of leadership by an individual. The pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese communist leaders under Choe Chang-ik agreed to confront Kim Il-Sung during the next major party meeting. When Kim opened the meeting to open discussion, Che Chang-ik started the public denunciation of Kim and his consolidation of power. Kim Il-Sung, unprepared, sought to end the meeting but lost control. In the end, the Central Committee voted to remove Kim for his failed leadership and replace him with a new General Secretary, Choe Chang-ik. The effort by Kim Il-Sung to consolidate power and purge rival factions within the party completely failed."
KPA_Purge.9.d:0 "The North Korean government announced the execution of Pak Il-u. The former Interior Minister was viewed as a powerful member of the pro-Chinese Yanan faction within the North Korean communist party. His removal is expected to draw criticism from the Chinese communists but indicates the continued decline of the Yanan faction. Many analysts see this latest purge as an indication that Kim Il-Sung is continuing to consolidate power around himself."
KPA_FOR.1.d:0 "North Korean premier Kim Il-Sung recently concluded a visit to the Soviet eastern bloc states. The trip strengthens the legitimacy of the North Korean regime and help establish it as a major player in the communist world. The North Korean leader visited many political leaders along with key industrial, and agricultural experts. North Korea is expected to expand its ties with these states and help the North Korean economy continue its socialist development. The trip also solidified ties with Moscow."
KPA_POL.5.d:0 "Kim Il-Sung, in a rare display of defiance, reacted strongly against the recent de-Stalinization policies being directed from Moscow. The North Korean premier condemns what he calls the revisionism and transition away from proper Marxist-Leninism and socialist development. More significantly, Kim Il-Sung announced his support of the Chinese opposition to the new Soviet policy. This marks a major shift as previously North Korea was seen as closely allied with the Soviet Union."
KPA_Purge.8.d:0 "The North Korean communist party continued its shakeup with news that the Kapsan faction is currently being purged from the party. This follows the removal of Kim Il-Sung from power by the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions. The Kapsan faction consists of former anti-Japanese Korean guerilla fighters who were closely allied with Kim. With their removal, the possibility of a pro-Kim counter-coup is greatly reduced. The new North Korean leadership is likely to continue consolidating its power over the party and state."
PWK.20.d:0 "The North Korean communist party announced a new program to purge the nation of the cult of personality. The Party leadership noted that the previous leaders had strayed from the socialist path by glorifying an individual leader over the needs of the nation or the party itself. It also added the new program will pave the way for North Korea to firmly establish collective leadership and greater national stability as socialism continues to prosper."
Juche.1.d:0 "North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung has begun articulating a new national ideology for the people of North Korea called Juche. He has called on North Korea to complete the transformation of the nation into a Marxist state based on the needs of the Korean people. Juche calls for North Korea to become completely self-reliant and independent on three levels. Through Juche North Korea will achieve political independence, along with economic and defense self-reliance. In subsequent publications, the government claimed the new ideology emerged from Kim Il-Sung and his experiences with anti-Japanese movements in the 1930s."
KPA_Purge.1.d:0 "The Domestic Faction has firmly been purged by the Party following reports of their anti-Marxist tendencies and desire for power. These former anti-Japanese fighters were firmly connected to Seoul but their ideologically failures prevented them from allowing socialism to flourish in occupied Korea. They spent more time plotting for power than supporting the revolutionary fervor among all Koreans. Their removal will strengthen the party and help strengthen revolutionary actions."
KPA_POL.1.d:0 "The Central Committee has held a spirited debate on the future of the party. One group of party leaders suggest the party must purge itself and focus membership among an elite cadre, much like the Soviet communist party. They argue this structure would help the state better organize the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in the country. Another group, consisting mostly of those Koreans trained on socialism outside China and the Soviet Union argue North Korea needs a mass party in order to more directly disseminate Marxist-Leninism to the masses. Those who argue for a mass party argue the people must be engaged with more directly."
KPA_POL.2.d:0 "The Domestic Faction has been publicly denounced by the Central Committee. The Domestic Faction have long claimed great influence among southern Marxists but their efforts at stirring a mass uprising in support of the revolution have not occurred. The Domestic Faction is accused of overstating its influence and being distracted by counter-revolutionary desires instead of nurturing revolutionary fervor. Their failure is a great stain to the mission of unification and independence under socialism."
KPA_POL.3.d:0 "The government announced it is removing those members from the south from positions in the Party. The southerners have failed in their mission to support a national revolution. They have also grown complacent and focused on personal achievement over the betterment of the party. Removing those failures and counter-revolutionaries will ensure the strength of the Party. New, more revolutionary and devoted members will replace those removed. The new promotions will be announced in the coming days." 
KPA_Purge.6.d:0 "Pak Hon-yong has been arrested for his crimes against the people. He represents the leadership of southern communists and had promised to stir southern unrest in support of our national liberation efforts. However, he has completely failed in these endeavors. This is due to his lack of commitment and focus on achieving personal glory and achievement. His arrest marks a great gain for the revolution and a first step to bringing the revolution back on track."
KPA_Purge.2.d:0 "Ho Ka-i has been removed from all his party posts. He has been accused of undermining the Korean revolution. He is accused of being an agent of foreign interests, especially that of the Soviet Union. The North Korean state must focus on its independence and revolutionary transformation. The removal of Ho Ka-i and his replacement with party members committed solely on the interest of Korea will only strengthen the party in this critical time."
August_Faction.4.d:0 "During a recent Plenary meeting of the Central Committee, some devious party members attempted to denounce Chairman Kim Il-Sung. They sought to cause a destabilizing leadership change. Thankfully, loyal members of the party stood up and condemned those selfishly seeking personal power. The attempted denouncement failed miserably and the party leadership remains intact. Once the meeting ended, the leader announced plans to clean the party of internal enemies."
August_Faction.5.d:0 "During a recent Plenary meeting of the Central Committee, some patriotic members successfully denounced Chairman Kim Il-Sung for his deviations from the socialist path. This stunning attack exposed Kim and led to a party debate which announced the removal of Chairman Kim from his leadership positions. A new party leadership will be announced and they have already promised to end the cult of personality and bring collective rule to the leadership. Already this change is being well-received abroad as the Soviet government expressed its support to the North Korean people."
Han_Sorya.3.d:0 "Han Sorya has been removed from his post as Education Minister from the Central Committee. The government declared that Sorya had become devoted to the cult of personality and had deviated sharply from proper Marxist-Leninism. His removal will revitalize the ideological education of the people and held stamp out the lingering effects of the toxic cult of personality fostered by the previous leadership."
Han_Sorya.2.d:0 "Han Sorya has emerged as a great champion of the revolution in North Korea. The gifted writer has devoted his efforts as Education Minister to not only further the ideological development of all Koreans but also purge the language of foreign influences. He is especially devoted to the Leader and his writings glorify and highlight the amazing advances made in recent years. More importantly, he has played a valuable role in shaping how the government is able to explain and justify its ideology of a completely independent Korean state." 
Han_Sorya.1.d:0 "Han Sorya has been appointed the head of the newly created Korean Writers Union. The gifted writer has long been a close confidant to the Leader and over the years has played a major role in expressing the ideology of the state to the people. More importantly, he has successfully cleansed the Korean language of foreign and capitalist influences. With his new position he is expected to more efficiently direct not just the education of Koreans but also the development of literature to better reflect the true devotion of the Korean people to the Party and Leader."
August_Faction.1.d:0 "The recent shift in Moscow has revitalized the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions within the Party. They believe Kim Il-Sung is moving on a counter-revolutionary path, especially with his cult of personality and what they see as a self-serving series of purges. They have developed a plan to confront Kim at the next Central Committee meeting and publicly denounce his policies to force a change in leadership. Chairman Kim Il-Sung has heard rumors of a plot but not details. He has the choice of filling the upcoming meeting with his supporters to protect himself or not. If he choses not to bring his supporters, it would show his strength to the party."
