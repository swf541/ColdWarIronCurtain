 VIN_Generic_Raid_Success:0 "A commander had spent several weeks organizing fighters and training them in the jungle as per our strategy. With his forces ready, he was able to find an isolated French outpost of their soldiers. Moving swiftly, our men assaulted the French position, inflicting casualties, driving the survivors off and collecting weapons and supplies. By the time a French relief force arrived our men had already melted back into the jungle. If we continue to launch successful attacks like these, where the French are vulnerable and where we are not exposed to their firepower, we will no doubt sap their will to continue."
 VIN_Generic_Raid_Failure:0 "A cadre of our fighters made a critical error that proved very costly. The fighters identified what appeared to be a weak French position and launched an assault. However, it appears the French were aware of the impending attack and were able to blunt the attack. Our fighters should have retreated back to their safe haven at this point, but filled with patriotic fervor, pressed on. This gave enough time for French reinforcements to arrive and they wheeled around to hit our attacking fighters on their flank. This proved devastating and what was left of our forces retreated. The failed raid has given the French confidence and has depleted our strength in the area."
 FRA_Generic_Raid_Success:0 "A relatively large band of communist fighters was spotted moving through the jungle. These men appear well-armed but are moving along so loudly that we have been able to track them. When they setup camp for the night, the local commander organized a raiding force of his best troops, lightly equipped and armed so they could move swiftly in the dense jungle. When they got in position and the enemy appeared most vulnerable, they attacked. It was a massive success, we suffered no major casualties and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Prisoners, weapons, and documents were all captured. With this information we believe other enemy units operating in the area can be traced as well, allowing us to uproot communist thugs from the area."
 FRA_Generic_Raid_Failure:0 "A young, ambitious officer had been pushing his men and leading them on aggressive patrols to root out communists and not surrender the area to enemy influence. Certainly, a noble objective but he had been warned such actions risked enemy responses. While on such a patrol, a local directed him to a location where he claimed a communist camp was established. Not wanting to miss the opportunity, the troops moved to attack the position, however, as soon as they entered the jungle, they were hit by an enemy ambush. In the initial exchange our forces took casualties but by the time they had started to return fire, the enemy had already withdrawn. Failures like these give the enemy confidence, sap our morale, and inspires the locals to join our enemy."

 Iran60.1.d:0 "The Shah recently unveiled plans for twelve-point reform program he called the White Revolution. It was recently approved in a national referendum. The program includes reforms on worker rights, industrialization, land reform, and social development. Land reform and a new Literacy Corps are among the most important elements for the Shah. Land reform intends to make lands productive and break the hold of absentee landowners. The Literacy Corps will consist of military conscripts who will spend their service providing literacy training to the countryside. Improving rural education facilitates modernization by breaking traditional norms and reducing clergy influence. The ambitious program seeks to transform Iran into a modern, educated, and industrialized state. However, critics note the ambitious program may be difficult to achieve even with heavy funding. In addition, they point out the Shah does not realize that such dramatic reforms being done while still maintaining the absolute monarchy may lead to future political unrest."
 Iran60.10.d:0 "After serving his sentence of solitary confinement in a military prison, former Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh was sent to house arrest at his family home in Ahmadabad. At the time of his sentencing the defiant constitutionalist claimed the verdict solidified his legacy. Mossadegh is viewed by many as a patriotic defender of national sovereignty. This popularity likely saved him from execution after his arrest. With the National Front victorious in the recent election, they announced the immediate release of Mohammad Mossadegh and praised his undying devotion to constitutionalism in Iran. The National Front have their leader back."
 Clerical_Opposition.1.d:0 "Tensions between the Shah and the Shia clergy has heightened since the White Revolution was announced. Many in the clergy see the reforms and modernization as efforts to subvert Islam and limit their own influence. One of the most outspoken critics, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini made an especially fiery sermon condemning the Shah and allegedly calling him a wretched, miserable man. The Iranian authorities soon arrested Khomeini and sent him to Tehran. This sparked thousands to angrily protest, leading to violent clashes that saw the military open fire on the crowds. After a week, the violence was finally brought under control. Although some in the regime wanted to execute Khomeini, the level of violence that erupted over his arrest pushed the regime to instead hold him in prison for the moment."
 Iran60.5.d:0 "The Shah of Iran recently concluded the lavish celebration of the 2500th anniversary of the Persian Empire. The celebration occurred in the ancient city of Persepolis. In addition to improving local infrastructure for the event, luxury tents filled Persepolis itself in the way the city would have looked two millennia ago. The celebration saw the Shah pay homage to the tomb of Cyrus, lauding him for being the first human rights champion in history. He sought to emphasize not just the historical heritage but also modern transformation of Iran. Two lavish banquets were held during the events. In addition, guests viewed a parade of over a thousand Iranian soldiers dressed in period cloths to show the different ages of Persian military might. The lavish event cost almost twenty million dollars and though the international press and many Iranians praised it as a showcase of Iranian culture and modernity, some Iranian clerics condemned the excessive costs."
 Iran60.6.d:0 "Since the time of the Safavids, the Zoroastrian community in Iran has faced continuous persecution. However, the Shah of Iran has recently made an effort to emphasize the historical role the Zoroastrian faith played in the development of Persian identity. Indeed, many Iranian nationalists now view Zoroastrians as an important symbol of Iranian identity and the glue which held the nation together prior to the arrival of Islam. This new emphasis on Zoroastrian heritage is being viewed with suspicion by the Iranian clergy. Observers note the Shah is emphasizing the pre-Islamic history and symbols of national unity as a wa to forge an Iranian identity independent of Islam."
 Cyrus.1.d:0 "Since early in his reign, the Shah of Iran has encouraged and facilitated the image of Cyrus the Great. The government and its supporters praise Cyrus and draw connections of his rule and reforms to the current Shah. The recently concluded celebration of the Persian Empire built itself around the Shah visiting the tomb of Cyrus and allegedly telling him that Iran has awakened. By placing these connections to Cyrus and being portrayed by supporters as a modern-day Cyrus, the Shah is better able to deliver his reforms to the people and not be beholden to the traditional sources of legitimacy, specifically Shia Islam and the clergy."

 Lebanon_Crisis.0.d:0 "President Camille Chamoun suggested the National Assembly should amend the constitution and allow him to run for a second term. This suggestion threatens the delicate Lebanese political system. The 1926 Constitution has held the deeply sectarian nation together but is predicated on the different confessional groups sharing power. Many fear that if Chamoun stays in power he will strengthen his political power and tip the balance of politics in favor of the Maronite Christians. The main concern has been the difficulties Chamoun has had working with the other religious factions. Since he came to power there have been multiple Prime Ministers, many lasting less than a year. How the country reacts to this latest comment and effort remains to be seen."
 Lebanon_Crisis.1.d:0 "Over recent years the tensions between Maronite Christians and Muslims has greatly increased. The Maronite President Camille Chamoun has increasingly taken a pro-Western line and avoiding association with the rising Arab nationalist feeling sweeping the wider-Arab world. Lebanese Muslims in particular support Arab nationalism, but the Maronites remain strongly dedicated to maintaining ties with Europe and the West. The recent Sinai Crisis has exploded into a political crisis in Lebanon. The Lebanese Muslims have begun protesting Chamoun who refused to break ties with Western states. The protestors also are demanding Lebanon join the United Arab Republic and stay away from the Baghdad Pact, which Chamoun has indicated an interest in joining. As tensions increase there are fears Lebanon may soon face an Arab nationalist revolution to overthrow the government. A desperate President Chamoun has appealed for the UN for help, after their refusal he has asked the United States."
 Lebanon_Crisis.2.d:0 "President Camille Chamoun of Lebanon formally requested the United States to intervene during the current political crisis consuming Lebanon. Chamoun believes the United Arab Republic (UAR) is using its supporters in Lebanon to undermine the government and overthrow it. Lebanon has been governed under the 1926 Constitution which offers a delicate balance among the different Lebanese confessional groups. Our analysts indicate a UAR coup may cause instability and lead to a civil war between the Maronite Christians and Muslims. A UAR expansion into Lebanon would also undermine the balance of power in the region and may provoke the Israelis, potentially turning the crisis into a regional war. Others argue an intervention would bog down American forces, hurt our standing among the Arabs, and leave an opening for Soviet influence in the region. We can either not intervene or intervene and preserve the current Lebanese political system."
 Lebanon_Crisis.3.d:0 "The American government launched Operation Blue Bat to restore order in Lebanon and protect its government from communist subversion. American forces entered Lebanon through the Beirut airport and Marines arrived from the shore. The forces were fully backed by the Lebanese government and quickly stabilized the situation by controlling Beirut and all routes to the capital. The American government also sent a senior diplomat to oversee the political situation. By the time the crisis passed, the American forces began a peaceful withdrawal from the country. In addition, the Lebanese President Camille Chamoun promised he would not change the 1926 constitution to seek a second term. The intervention succeeded in its objectives of preserving the government and keeping the political system intact. The success in Lebanon has led many in Washington to consider similar military deployments in the future to preserve American interests."
 Lebanon_Crisis.4.d:0 "The United States government followed the lead of the United Nations and decided to not intervene during the current political crisis. Within days, pro-United Arab Republic (UAR) protestors broke into a revolt in Beirut. When the army was deployed, many officers and soldiers joined the protestors. Hours later the Lebanese government was overthrown, and a committee of Arab nationalist officers and politicians declared the formation of a new ruling council. They then announced their offer to obey the wishes of the Lebanese people and requested a union with the UAR. The UAR quickly accepted and senior UAR officials flew to begin the integration of Lebanon. The Lebanese Maronite Christians are said to be concerned and while many are considering a flight to Europe, others are preparing for the possibility of a military intervention. The Lebanese revolution is being widely praised across the wider-Arab world, but Israel has expressed its concerns with these developments."


 LEB_NAKBA.1.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Palestinian war in 1947, nucleated pockets of refugee Palestinians are living throughout the southern portion of Lebanon. Local Lebanese business owners have claimed to been attacked by some Palestinians, while others generally believe that refugees are taking away employment opportunities from the local Lebanese people. Many refugee Palestinians of which, are Christians seeking asylum in a country of many religions. Although the Lebanese authority in Beirut has yet to acknowledge the needs or citizenship requests of many refugees in the region, relations between the Palestinians and native Lebanese are in hot waters. As more refugees and asylum seekers pour into the borders of Lebanon from Palestine, relations between the states could break down the not too distant future."
 LEB_ISR.1.d:0 "From the roots of founding the nation-state of Israel in 1948, the Arab League, consisting of  Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, and Lebanon had expressed immense protest regarding the partition of Palestine by the British and western powers. Dead set on the creation of an Arab Palestinian State, the Arab League members unanimously decided a declaration of war on the state of Israel was justified. Expecting a quick victory, the relatively minor Lebanese army alongside it’s larger Arab League counterparts were successful at first. Shortly later the Lebanese were pushed back to their pre-war borders, where Israeli forces began occupying the southern portion of Lebanon. With armistice signed back in March of 1949, an official ceasefire between the State of Israel and Lebanon has been signed. The only question remains, how long will it last for..."
 Lebanon_Pol.3.d:0 "It is currently 8:00 PM in Beirut Lebanon where multiple regime officials have articulated that integral portions of the ruling Khouri regime have collapsed on itself. President Bechara El Khoury of Lebanon, notorious for his strong nationalistic views and anti-French sentiment in the 1940s. Famous for imposing legislation that sought to equalize both Christian and Muslim minorities regarding cultural rights, Koury’s regime was one of great controversy.   Initial short term intelligence reports from the CIA are suggesting that political opposition, partially spurred by that seen in Egypt, sewed renewals of plans to overthrow the presidential regime. Many dissidents and those opposed to the Kouri regime have appealed to both French and US governments for assistance with the possible overthrow of the president, whether it be of political or military means. The Pentagon officials have yet to respond with an official statement to supposed requests."
 Lebanon_Pol.4.d:0 "The recently signed Baghdad pact of 1955 has just won the support of the Lebanese government. Out of the five current members, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, Lebanon would be the sixth signing country to enter the military alliance. Modelled after NATO, the pact aims to commit mutual cooperation and protection amongst each nation. It is a guarantee that would have been non-existent in the middle east only a few decades prior. It seems the members of the pact have welcomed the state of Lebanon with open arms, from here the bloc only gets stronger."
 Lebanon_Pol.5.d:0 "When neighbouring states like Syria to the east and Israel to the south, it seems Lebanon visibly struggles to maintain absolute independence of influence from its neighbours in the region. Although it seems that Egypt, not even physically bordering Lebanon, has rocked the middle east with radical views endangering the status quo. Egypt has become the main propagator of Pan Arabism ideals, with popularity of the idea sparking all over the Middle East & North Africa. With this rising threat, the government of Lebanon has outright denounced both the Egyptian and general Pan-Arabism movements as a destabilizing force to the region. Undoubtedly the Lebanon government has rejected these ideals, with no change of support appearing any time soon."
 SSNP_Focus.2.d:0 "Notorious SSNP founder, political figure and philosopher, Antoun Saadeh, had managed to escape Lebanese prison last evening. Previously sentenced to death, Saadeh had been captured & arrested 3 years ago while returning to Lebanon from France when the country gained independence. With a single revolutionary speech in return, Lebanese authorities had issued an arrest warrant on the socialist. Following violent provocative protests eventually turning into a revolt, Saadeh managed to escape Lebanon to Damascus. With the president of Syria, Husni al-Za'im, promising to support Saadeh, a meeting took place. With a turn of events, president al-Za’im returned Saadeh to the Lebanese Authorities followed by a military court trial in Lebanon. It turns out while awaiting his execution in a detention cell, prison guards were nowhere to be seen, allowing a quick and easy escape for the fugitive. Once again the socialist revolutionary has jumped the bullet, with no doubt in continuing to preach of his socialist views into the future." 
 SSNP_Focus.1.d:0 "Notorious SSNP founder, political figure and philosopher, Antoun Saadeh, was executed this morning by firing squad. Previously sentenced to death, Saadeh had been captured & arrested 3 years ago while returning to Lebanon from France when the country gained independence. With a single revolutionary speech in return, Lebanese authorities had issued an arrest warrant on the socialist. Following violent provocative protests eventually turning into a revolt, Saadeh managed to escape Beirut to Damascus. With the president of Syria, Husni al-Za'im, promising to support Saadeh, a meeting took place. With a turn of events, president al-Za’im returned Saadeh to the Lebanese Authorities. Followed by a military court trial in Lebanon sentencing him to death, Saadeh’s run of socialist preaching in Lebanon and the Levant had finally concluded."
 Lebanon_Pol.1.d:0 "Following the rise of the Christian political leadership in Lebanon, an expected dismissal of Arab politicians and leaders has occurred. The Christians in Lebanon had been present in the region since the first century, with a rising percentage of Islam in religious demographics and migration of Arabs into the region. With a pro Christian leadership in Lebanon, the future of new Arab politicians and lawmakers has been stopped in its tracks."
 Lebanon_Pol.2.d:0 "With the rise of the Christian political leadership in Lebanon, an unexpected dismissal of prime minister Riyad-Al Solh has occurred. Originally born in Sidon, a city in the south of Lebanon, Riyad’s family were wealthy sunni landowners of Egyptian and Palestnian ancestry. Chosen as prime minister of Lebanon by President Al Khouri, Solh’s tenure was marked by signing Lebanon’s National Pact, otherwise known as the framework to unify the peoples of Lebanon. His loyalty to Lebanon had been in question due to his cultural ties to Palestine and ancestral roots to Egypt. With the growth of Christian political scene in Lebanon, Solh was the largest outstanding target to his opposition."
 LEB_Assasination.1.d:0 "Reports breaking from Beirut suggest an socialist left-leaning armed insurgency has taken to the streets after the assination of leftist journalist Nasib Al-Matni. Al-Matni was an outspoken critic of the Lebanese government and a positive voice for the left leaning-socialist underground of Beirut and Lebanon in general. With the current political climate of Lebanon being that of instability to say the least, total civil war is not even close to being out of the question. The death of this polarizing journalist will most definitely turn the heads of its loyal and devout readers."
 SSNP_Focus.15.d:0 "At last, the Syrian peoples of Lebanon have risen up against the oppressive regime in collaboration with the SSNP. In both a televised and radio broadcasted announcement, Lebanese Syrians announced the dissolution of the Lebanese state, government, and authoritative body. Further, the political merger of the two nations would occur. No statements from the SSNP have announced any stance on currently serving Lebanese political figures or their guaranteed safety. A seemingly minor movement only three years ago has brought down one of the middle east’s most stable democracies."

 NF_Iran.10.d:0 "Following the death of legendary constitutionalist and popular leader Mohammad Mossadegh, the National Front faced a dilemma on who would take over. After much discussion and with the left rising within the party, it was decided that Karim Sanjabi would take over. A trained lawyer, Sanjabi served as a close ally and cabinent member for Mossadegh. His steadfast loyalty to Mossadegh along with his leftist views make him the ideal candidate. Many within the party argue Sanjabi is the natural successor and will lead the party to future success. His long career in politics and government is also considered a major plus in managing the dangerous field of Iranian politics."
 Khomenei.1.d:0 "Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini was exiled from Iran recently. The Iranian government made the decision following an explosion of violence that erupted over his sermons condemning the Shah and the government over its policies. Khomeini is currently in Turkey but is expected to eventually settle in the holy Shia city of Najaf in Iraq. The Iranian authorities believe removing him from the country will reduce his control over his followers across Iran."
 Iran_Coronation.1.d:0 "Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was officially coronated during an extravagant coronation in Tehran. He had previously gone by the title King but at the coronation adopted the ancient title of Shahanshah (King of Kings). The new title emphasizes his link to the long history of Iranian royalty and goes along his efforts at tying Iranian identity towards the ancient and cultural past. When asked why he chose his coronation after decades as king, the Shah declared Iran was a poor country when he took the throne and now he has earned his title. In audience he will now be referred to as His Imperial Majesty instead of His Majesty."

The United States had been deeply involved in the region previously, offering diplomatic support for South Vietnam. In addition, American military advisors are already on the ground, but this new deployment marks a major escalation. Previously American forces were only allowed to train and advise the South Vietnamese, now the American military will actively support and aid the South Vietnamese against communist aggression. Many analysts believe this new escalation will quickly turn the tide against the communists."

 CRO_insurgency_options.0.d:0 "During the late stages of World War II, the so-called state of Croatia and their fascist masters in Berlin established bands of guerrilla fighters called Crusaders to operate against our liberating forces. Many of their commanders and men are former members of the fascist regime and although they did not do much during the war, they have recently activated. The Crusaders are trying to garner support, especially among anti-revolutionary forces, Croatian nationalists, and Catholics to re-establish their illegal regime. They accuse us of being oppressors and anti-Croatian. However, we will show them their ideology and claims have no effect on our people who continue to support the government and our revolution. All peoples of Yugoslavia, especially the Croatians will recognize the vile lies being spread by the Crusaders."
 CRO_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Crusaders hoped to use terroristic tactics and fascist propaganda to convince the Croat people to join them and re-establish a Croatian government. However, the people could not be fooled, and their lack of support ensured these enemy fighters became easy targets for our forces. They tried to imitate our tactics from the war but were a pale imitation and our knowledge of such tactics made them easy to conquer. As the last bands of Crusader fighters surrender, we will use this victory to further strengthen the party by cracking down on the Catholic church and other organizers which were clearly sympathetic to the Crusaders. Our victory and close cooperation with the Croat population will help ensure the rebuilt Yugoslavian state will bring all its peoples together as one."
 CRO_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The Yugoslavian military is withdrawing its last forces from Croatia today following an agreement with the government and the Croat guerrilla fighters known as the Crusaders. The Crusaders, consisting mainly of former soldiers of the German puppet Croatian state, successfully managed to resist Yugoslavian forces and garner widespread popular support among the Croatian people. With this support, they were able to put the Yugoslavians in the unenviable position of facing an ethnic and ideological war. This defeat for Yugoslavia raises questions on whether the communist regime can continue to unite the many peoples under its flag or if this defeat is the beginning of a gradual disintegration of the whole nation. Despite these fears the Yugoslavian government noted the revolution remains strong and they have simply removed a fascist cancer from the body."
 CRO_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "Following reports of Crusader activities in an area, one of our units ascertained the likely location of the enemy fighters. This analysis proved accurate as an enemy farmhouse was identified. During a raid, our forces stormed the farmhouse, capturing or killing the Crusaders located inside with no loss of lives. Enemy weapons and supplies were seized. It appears this band of fighters had hopped to move and live among the local townspeople but did not find much support to their activities. This victory will raise morale among our men and show the people we are fighting for them and not against them."
 CRO_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "Our forces received reports on the location of a bad of Crusader fighters who had conducted sabotage operations in the area. They traced them to an apartment complex. When our troops stormed in, they used aggressive force and secured the building. However, it turned out the Crusaders had already fled and instead the residents within the complex were detained and searched aggressively. No documents, weapons, or evidence was discovered and the locals in the town are infuriated by our actions. This failed operation has only served to hurt the image of our forces in the are and re-enforce the propaganda of our enemy."
 CRO_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Yugoslav Air Force gives our forces a distinct advantage over the fascist Crusaders. In a recent operation they successfully identified a concentration of enemy forces. Our planes moved in and bombed the target successfully. A patrol sent to assess the strike noted casualties were inflicted and from the record found evidence of weapons and Crusader markings showing the accuracy of the strikes. With this success the enemy will be more wary to meet in larger numbers and this will help protect our forces operating in the area. The local commander called his Air Force comrades to commend their success."

Our planes moved in and bombed the target successfully. However, when a patrol was sent to assess the strike they discovered the structure hit had no evidence of a Crusader presence. The operation had been a failure but of more concern was that it has provoked anger from locals who believe the bombing targeted civilians. They also criticized the use of airpower saying this indicated the party and government view them as an enemy population and questioned whether we would use such firepower in a Serbian community."
 CRO_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Crusaders are successors to Nazi collaborators and violent fascists. Our intelligence operations from the war provides us with a list of former collaborators and Croat nationalist sympathizers. In a recent operation our intelligence operatives recruited some of these figures and threatened to reveal their wartime collaboration with foreign occupiers to coerce them into joining Crusader cells and feed us information. The Crusaders are very suspicious of outsiders but do trust their wartime supporters. The men recruited have succeeded in their mission and are providing us valuable information on Crusader tactics, movements, and numbers in the area. We plan on rolling up several cells and removing the Crusader presence in the area."

 #YANSA Events
 YANSA.100.d:0 "For nearly a millennia, the Shan people of Eastern Burma were a mix of Burmese, Thai, and Laotian cultures. The history of a Shan state has been scattered throughout the centuries mainly attributed to the heavily contested region between traditional Burmese kingdoms, Thai invaders, and the Kingdom of Shan itself. For the past decade, the British rule of Burma was disoriented due to Japanese operations during the war, seemingly putting an end to properly organized colonial administration of the country. At last, a state that had been extinct for practically the last century and a half has been resurrected. The only question that remains... Is it for how long?"
 Collapse_Burma.1.d:0 "Burma, one of the great mystical lands of the east ruled by the British dating back to 1824 finally sees a gleam of independence. The Colony of Burma gained prominence because of the decision not to incorporate the region into the British RAJ, rather, organizing its peoples into a separate Burmese colonial state. British rule over Burma(known as the “Burma Office”) has finally seemed to have come to a conclusion. With a combination of internal and external factors affecting the colony and administrators. The official Union State of Burma has announced its founding with a ceremonial raising of the new young republic's national flag. Interestingly enough, no interest has been expressed by the young nation to join the Commonwealth as an official member of the organization, uncommon among Britain's former colonies."
 YANSA.200.d:0 "The Burmese government has requested that the bodies of KMT fighters who fled mainland China after the conclusion of the civil war would be interred in France. Many of these KMT fighters operated in rogue groups, stealing crops from Burmese farmers and pressing influence on the Mandalay government. The KMT has grown an increasingly negative and ugly perception among the people of Burma because of the multiple crimes committed by the groups."
 YANSA.101.d:0 "The exiled government of the Republic of China(now located on the island of Taiwan) alongside the US agreed to support the establishment of YANSA, the exiled guerilla remnants of the KMT forces located in Yunnan during the Chinese civil war. YANSA(Yunnan Anti-Communist and National Salvation Army) continues to fight multiple groups of Burmese security forces in the state of Shan, which had pockets of occupying KMT fighters. With the multiple requests from the Burmese government to remove these KMT contingents from the country, YANSA territory will serve as a small buffer between Shan and the agitated Thai border."
 SS_HAITEN.1.d:0 "In preperation of the Operation Earth and the seaborne logistical components, leaders of the KMT in Taiwan, and KMT YANSA guerilla movement organizers met in Taipei to discuss planning. The operation consisted of multiple shipments of weapon armaments and equipment to arrive on the Tenasserim coast of Burma. Additionally, CNA veterans would deploy to YANSU encampments to train and arm the guerrillas. As the plan stated, these forces ideally would secure a corridor on the coast moving their way into the Shan state. The fiasco began to brew when the crew of the ship(the SS Haitien) was unable to contact anyone onshore, resulting in a makeshift small wooden pier being constructed from the ship. The bad luck continued when officers on the ship failed to receive any messages from the YANSU command. An operation turned fiasco, Taiwan is back on the world's radar."
 SS_HAITEN.2.d:0 "The seemingly perfect operation conducted by KMT Taiwan officials to resupply and arm KMT YANSU guerrillas in the Shan state of Burma has been conducted. The operation consisted of multiple shipments of weapon armaments and equipment to arrive on the Tenasserim coast of Burma. Additionally, CNA veterans would deploy to YANSU encampments to train and arm the guerrillas. As the plan stated, these forces ideally would secure a corridor on the coast moving their way into the Shan state. The SS Haitien, a ship designated by the KMT under the personal supervision of Chiang Kai Shek set sail for Burma. When arriving on the coast,  a small contingent of KMT YANSU troops awaited the crew to depart onto the beaches. From there, the Taiwanese officers alongside KMT veterans made their way to the YANSU encampments."

 Operation_Heaven.2.d:0 "Since the existence of an independent Burmese state, remenants of the Yunnan-Chinese Kuomintang armies which had retreated to the Burmese border have existed in the state since the early 50s. US support of the remaining KMT groups in Burma has existed since the great retreat, with hopes of containing the Burmese government with KMT influence. In 1953, the state of Burma appealed to the United Nations to put pressure on the Republic of China(Taiwan) to remove the various KMT groups of influence scattered in the northeast of the country. Now but only a few of the KMT groups remain..."
 KMT_BURMA.11.d:0 "Reports breaking from Mandalay suggest multiple rural towns in Shan and Kachin provinces have been pillaged and plundered by the swindling KMT presence in the country. Multiple KMT groups have operated in the eastern states of the country since the end of the Chinese civil war, operating as exiled contingencies on the border. Burmese authorities have reason to believe that a lack of supplies and food could be a justification for the gruesome attacks. The people of Burma question why the government hasn't taken further steps in finally removing the foreign bloodsuckers from the lands far to the east."
 Shan_Recognition.1.d:0 "Historical ties between the various Thai Kingdoms and Shan peoples in the past centuries have left a unique sense of relationship in the region. The Thai government's decision to officially recognize the independence of the Shan State from the newly partitioned Union of Burma has caused much disagreement between the two neighbours. Military and economical aid from Thailand can be expected to reach the Independent Shan State shortly, with its peoples disconnected from the rest of the world. Thailand's recognition of the Independent Shan state could possibly result in a power imbalance between Burma and Thailand, leading to a tense future of disagreements between the two stakeholder nations.

 SSNP_Insurgency_Decisions_desc:0 "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) advocates for a Greater Syria and the unification of all the fertile crescent Arabs. It rejects the present borders of Lebanon as a construct of colonialism and advocates for an association with Syria and preservation of the historical and cultural identity of the people. The group threatens the existence of Lebanon and offers an attractive ideology for many Lebanese. However, the government works to breakup the group as it threatens the fragile political order that holds the Lebanese state and society together.\n\nCurrent Strength: [?.ssnp_insurgency]%" 

 SSNP_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "The Lebanese Army launched a successful raid today in Beirut. Local informants noted SSNP student activists were meeting in a local apartment building, plotting an attack on government targets. When the troops stormed in, they found SSNP members, documents, propaganda paraphernalia and weapons. Some students tried to fire at the assaulting troops, but they were neutralized. Raids like these continue to degrade the SSNP and will ensure the party does not spread its dangerous anti-state messages. One of the captured fighters was identified as the leader of an urban guerrilla cell that had launched several attacks on the Army. The local media was shown the weapons collected along with the hateful messages this cell planned to distribute to the residents in the city."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The Lebanese Army launched a raid on a residential building in Beirut. They had received information about SSNP student activists meeting to plot violence and spread hate. When the troops entered the building, confusion ensued and several of the occupants were shot by our soldiers. However, upon inspecting the scene, it became clear that though the occupants were SSNP members, they possessed no weapons, explosives, or publications that could be deemed hateful. The news that our forces are violently assaulting unarmed students has caused animosity among the people, especially the youths. The local commander claims the information about the students may have been planted by the SSNP to make the government look bad and weaken public support."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The SSNP enjoys a strong base of support in Beirut and other urban areas in Lebanon. The group makes extensive publications and especially targets young students to join their cause. In a recent operation at a major university, our intelligence agents recruited several students to join the SSNP and feed us information on their tactics, membership, and plans. The operation so far has been a success as our intelligence now has a clear picture on membership and activities of the SSNP at the school. If the time comes, we should be able to easily swoop in and uproot the SSNP rapidly from the campus."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "The SSNP enjoys a strong base of support in Beirut and other urban areas in Lebanon. The group makes extensive publications and especially targets young students to join their cause. In a recent operation at a major university, our intelligence agents recruited several students to join the SSNP and feed us information on their tactics, membership, and plans. The operation had been seen as a success by our intelligence as they gained a clear picture on membership and activities of its members on campus. However, when we moved in to uproot the senior leadership and stop a plot to acquire weapons, we ended up arresting anti-SSNP members on campus. It turns out our infiltrators turned into defectors. They fed us false information and tricked us into acting, this has antagonized the anti-SSNP organizations against the government and has bolstered their arguments about state oppression."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Lebanese Air Force launched a daring raid, dropping bombs and strafing a convoy that moving towards the countryside from Beirut. Upon inspecting the wreckage, the bodies of several senior SSNP activists and their cadres were found. More significantly, they were transporting arms and ammunition. It is believed they were trying to shift the arms to a store house and conduct arms training before returning to Beirut as urban guerrilla fighters. The successful operation by our small Air Force shows the daring professionalism of the armed forces and will teach the SSNP to not expand operations against the government."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "A small military outpost reported it took heavy fire and casualties from a suspected SSNP group of fighters. The Lebanese Air Force identified a convoy near the outpost as the rebels fleeing. The planes bombed and strafed the vehicles. Upon inspecting the wreckage, our shocked investigators could not find any indication the vehicles contained SSNP members. In addition, no arms or uniforms were recovered. It appears the pilots had made an error but already the SSNP is using their media contacts to portray a message that we are punishing citizens without reason. The failure has hurt the morale of our pilots and hurts local support for the government."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The conflict between the Lebanese government and the SSNP reached an end today with the government legalizing the party. For years the SSNP had advocated for a Greater Syria and association of the fertile crescent peoples. However, the rise of Arab nationalism during the recent crisis in Lebanon threatened the integrity of the Lebanese political order. The government recognizes that in order to preserve Lebanon and counter the Arab nationalist threat it must bring groups like the SSNP into the political process. For the SSNP, the Arab nationalist vision of a grand Arab unification threatens the culture and historical identity of fertile crescent peoples and their ideology is already taking away members. Legalization will allow the party to focus on building its message and combating the threat of Arab nationalism. The Lebanese government is gambling that by bringing the SSNP into politics it will successfully draw support away from Arab nationalists in the country."
 SSNP_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "Military officers loyal to the  seized power in Lebanon today. The coup unfolded in Beirut when two of the officers led their soldiers and rapidly captured the cabinet and senior leadership of Lebanon. The rebels then took over a radio station and announced a new government. Military and police forces did not react, and party leaders moved in to take over. The lack of response is being attributed to a general shock among the security forces but regardless this allowed the SSNP to consolidate its hold. When the SSNP party leaders addressed the country they stated the coup was meant to preserve the cultural and historical identity of the people and defeat the rising influence of Arab nationalists in the government. They noted had the SSNP not acted, the Arab nationalists would have handed the country off to North Africans and Gulf Arabs who had no business telling them what to do."

  burma.1.d:0 "Ever since achieving independence from Britain in 1948, our country has been plagued by political turmoil and civil strife, including multiple Communist insurgencies and the ruling AFPFL party splitting into two competing factions. Whilst we have managed to keep our nation together, the latest danger to the government appears to be the military, who we have come to rely on to maintain order over the years, and relations with them have been tense ever since they accepted the rule of the civilian government two years ago. In a sudden and unexpected turn of events, military commander Ne Win has orchestrated a nationwide military coup against our government. Army divisions have already seized strategic positions in Rangoon and are cementing their grip over the country, with their goal seemingly being to end democracy and return Burma to a one-party military dictatorship. However, it may not be too late to act and make an attempt to restore order to the country."

The Immigration Restriction Bill was one of the first Bills introduced to the new parliament and proposed a twofold approach to restricting non-white population growth. The Act came into law on 23 December 1901, formally representing the establishment of the ‘White Australian Policy'The Act gave immigration officers the power to make any non-European migrant sit a 50-word dictation test. This was initially given in any European language, and after 1905 in any prescribed language.Small numbers of migrants were granted certificates of exemption from the test but often exempted people became separated from their friends and family members who did not pass and were deported.The introduction of two accompanying acts (the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 and the Post and Telegraph Act 1901) further limited access to Australia for non-white migrants by outlawing the use of imported labour and making it mandatory to hire white workers on any vessels transporting Australian mail."

 Khruschev_SU.1.d:0 "The governing Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) has governed North Korea since its founding under Kim il-sung. However, this changed today as the pro-Soviet faction within the party launched a successful coup. Previously, Chairman Kim had been able to defeat challengers from the party's many factions or play the them off each other while preserving his own power. However, the Soviet government's criticism of personality cults and other issues left Chairman Kim vulnerable to denouncement. The pro-Soviet faction, saw these public criticisms as an opportunity, and plotted to denounce Kim at the next Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. Chairman Kim, usually aware of such plots was not prepared. At the meeting the pro-Soviet faction, working with several other factions, publicly denounced Chairman Kim, his supporters were unaware and could not shout them down. Neutral party members, who Kim could have coaxed onto his side if he had been aware were unsure and remained silent, allowing the denouncements to continue. A stunned Chairman Kim could not shore up an effective resistance to the criticism and by the end of the session he was removed from office. News spread slowly as the new pro-Soviet government sought to consolidate its control as it purged pro-Kim officials from power. How the pro-Chinese factions and the Chinese government will react to this change will remain to be seen. However, the Soviet Union is said to be pleased to have North Korea back on the proper revolutionary track. The WPK looks forward to a new phase in its revolutionary development."

 SAU_Focus_Events_1_d:0 "The Saudi government announced the death of King Ibn Saud today. The founder of the modern Saudi state passed away from a heart attack overnight in his palace in Ta'if. Ibn Saud was born in 1875 to the ruler of Nedj. However, in his teenage years he and his family fled as exiles when his family rival's the Rashidis conquered Nedj. By 1902, Ibn Saud led a band of relatives and followers to re-conquer his family's hometown of Riyadh. This led to a campaign against the Rashidis which saw Ibn Saud successfully liberate his family's homeland while driving the Ottomans out of the region. He embraced the ancient alliance between his family and the Wahabi sect. With Wahabi support in the form of a unifying ideology and devoted fighters Ibn Saud was able to eventually conquer the Rashidis in 1922. He solidified his position as a world leader by conquering the Hejaz from the Hashimites in 1925 and in 1932 he proclaimed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. His control of the annual Hajj pilgrimage gave him and Wahabism prestige across the Muslim world, but the discovery of crude oil in the late 1930s would provide unprecedented wealth for the kingdom. Ibn Saud used Wahabism to unite the tribes of Arabia and oil wealth allowed him to offer subsidies to secure loyalty from his subjects. His impressive military victories were combined with tact diplomacy as he navigated regional tensions and secured a close partnership with the United States. Questions will be asked if his successors can maintain the Saudi alliance with the Wahabis and if they will continue to court American support to ensure they will be protected from threats to the kingdom both external and internal. Prince Saud, his son is considered the favorite to take the throne."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.2.d:0 "Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was coronated earlier today in Saudi Arabia. He has the tremendous responsibility of succeeding his father, the legendary King Ibn Saud who founded the modern Saudi state. Where his father united a kingdom of Bedouin chieftains, the new King Saud must contend with regional instability, ideological threats, and international intrigue. Saudi Arabia controls huge oil reserves and the Saudi king must content with much more than just organizing the annual pilgrimage and securing loyalty from his subjects. In addition relations with the Wahabi ulema must continue to be preserved and nurtured as losing their support risks major internal instability. In his opening speech to his people and the world at large, the new King announced a new Council of Ministers. In addition, he said his reign will not be focused on military conflict but on ending poverty, expanding education, healthcare, securing a strong military for defense, and on implementing Sharia to all within the kingdom. King Saud had long been appointment crown prince and was well-prepared by his father to rule as a desert ruler of Arabia. However, some worry handling the country's growing oil wealth and dealing with the different ideologies flourishing in the Arab world may be too much for the new King. Time will tell whether the new king can rise to the challenge he faces in a world vastly different from the one he grew up with."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.3.d:0 "Following the coronation of King Saud, Prince Faisal took over as crown prince to his brother the king. Prince Faisal served administrative posts, as a military leader for his father King Ibn Saud, and has extensive diplomatic experience as the Saudi foreign minister. King Saud's ambitious projects and extravagant spending has led to financial problems and public discomfort to the government. In addition, radio broadcasts from Arab nationalist states denouncing the old Arab monarchies have gained increasing popularity among segments of the population. Fearing the current wave of Arab nationalism and growing public anger at government spending has led a faction of the ulema and royal family to band together. They have confronted King Saud and have demanded he place Prince Faisal to the post of Prime Minister with executive powers. Reluctantly, the King has agreed and Faisal has become Prime Minister. Diplomats in Riyadh believe this may curtail the King's more impulsive decisions but there is little doubt the brothers will clash and it is highly possible that instead of acting as a check to the king's power this may instead lead to larger infighting within the Saudi royal family. Only time will tell whether this appointment can restore Saudi prestige."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.4.d:0 "In shocking developments today, members of the Saudi Air Force have taken control of Riyadh. They have seized major government. Military, transportation, and media facilities and are said to have much of the royal family under armed guard. Military fighters bombed palaces and military sites leading to fears that the royal family has suffered big losses. From state radio the Saudi coup leaders announced the end of a decadent regime and the birth of a new Arab Republic in Riyadh. Radio Cairo has reacted to glee at this coup as President Nasser long declared the liberation of the Arab World would first have to begin with the liberation of Riyadh. Urban middle-class Saudis are said to be happy with these developments but rural Saudi citizens, especially the Arab chieftains may not take this change peacefully. There are rumors that Prince Talal may be coming back to Saudi Arabia and indeed may already be there. He had led many young princes to Egypt in support of Nasser following the Egyptian Revolution and his faction of the royal family may help the transition of Saudi Arabia to an Arab Republic as he long advocated transitioning Saudi Arabia into a constitutional government. The United States embassy is surrounded as Washington struggles to comprehend what has occurred in what it sees as one of the most critical states in the world. The rest of the world is also watching these developments closely as the Saudis have long been guardians of the Islamic holy lands and their control of global oil reserves may effect energy prices. For Nasser, a friendly regime in Saudi Arabia can transform the regional balance of power, leaving Saudi Arabia's monarchical neighbors in a mood of panic."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.5.d:0 "Saudi Arabia today announced it had arrested dozens of Air Force personnel who were plotting to overthrow the Saudi state. Many more arrests are expected to follow in the aftermath. The government had long suspected Nasserists had infiltrated the military and the urban middle-class. The government said the plotters were about to launch a putsch that would see Riyadh taken over and air raids on key government facilities. President Nasser, through Radio Cairo had long advocated that the liberation of the Arab World would begin with the liberation of Riyadh and the breakup of this plot will no doubt be a great blow to his regional objectives. The failure of the coup will no doubt push the Saudi government to strengthen oversight on the military and increase its paranoia. Prince Talal and the young princes who have long been sympathetic to Nasser and a transition to a constitutional government will be under much greater scrutiny by the Saudi King. The United States will be breathing a sigh of relief that it helped prevent the fall of a critical ally in the region."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the successful Saudi Free Officer coup a revolutionary fervor has swept supporters of the revolutionaries. These supporters have taken to the street to cheer on military units and throw rocks at palaces and officers associated with the royal family. Many prominent Saudi princes have been detained in these facilities under the watch of their personal bodyguards. However, in recent hours, mid-level Saudi military officers from the Free Officer movement have been moving house to house with armed contingents. Most of the princes' households' bodyguards either surrendered or were overpowered by the armed troops. Once the officers took control of the palaces, the princes and their households were dragged out of their homes and executed either in the courtyard of the palaces or out on the streets. Those princes killed on the streets had their bodies dragged and desecrated by the roving mobs. The Free Officer Movement announced the deaths of many prominent princes and declared these deaths were the natural expression of a people long chained by a decadent ruling class. Considering how the Saudi state had been run through the royal family and its many princes, these executions are a way for the revolutionaries to decapitate the old political class and pave the way for a new order. While Nasserists see these actions as necessary, those Arab states which were ideologically close with the Saudi Royal family are said to be infuriated by the actions."
 SAU_Focus_Events.7.d:0 "Around 15,000 workers in the Saudi oil industry joined a strike for better working conditions. The Saudi King has ordered a royal commission of inquiry as this marks a radical transformation in labor-relations in the kingdom. Saudi workers were said to be inspired by foreign Arab workers who pointed out their poor conditions in comparison to the vastly superior conditions their American managers enjoy in the kingdom. The bad conditions and refusal for ARAMCO to meet worker demands has driven anti-Americans as the workers believed the American-owned company's actions reflected what the United States thought of the workers. Also radicalizing the workers into striking has been recent inflation and anger at opulent spending by the royal family. To coordinate the strike, a workers' committee has been established and the unity of Saudi workers beyond tribal bonds is seen as a major threat to the Saudi royal family. The Saudi King will have to decide on whether to give in to the worker demands, offer a few concessions, or reject the worker demands. Giving in to all the demands may make the workers happy but embolden them to make more demands and empower the influence of foreign workers. In addition, the United States will not be happy if ARAMCO loses the strike. Supporting ARAMCO and rejecting the workers will help our standing with the United States but infuriate the workers, so perhaps a compromise will be the best route. In the long-term the government must consider how to control the influence of foreign labor on the citizens of Saudi Arabia."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.8.d:0 "The British and United States have strongly pressured the Saudi government to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. The alliance brought Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom together in an anti-communist regional pact. The British strongly believe having the Saudis would solidify the alliance's legitimacy among the monarchical Arab states. However, after careful consideration, the Saudi government announced the King refused to join. The Saudi government argues it cannot support or join any regional alliances or blocks which further foreign agendas. Doing so would inevitably lead to unacceptable inter-Arab conflicts and hurt regional tranquility. Privately, reporters in Riyadh were told by government sources the Saudi government had another issue with the alliance. The Saudi government was not too keen about joining an alliance that included the Hashemite state of Iraq as the Hashemite and Saudi families were historical rivals. Also the Saudi leadership felt a Western backed, anti-communist alliance in the region would provoke a counter-bloc to be formed by either the Soviet Union or Egypt that would inevitably lead to conflict."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.9.d:0 "Strong lobbying in Riyadh by American and British diplomats led to a major breakthrough today. The Saudi Arabian government released a statement stating the King intended to join the newly created Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), also called the Baghdad Pact. Saudi Arabia joins the anti-communist regional pact, which already includes Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom. The Saudi government calculates that CENTO ensures the spread of radical leftist politics in the region and republican pan-Arabism will be curtailed by the alliance. By joining with Hashemite Iraq, it appears the historical rivalry between the two royal dynasties has been resolved. Although some diplomats in the region privately state this rivalry may unravel the alliance from within. For the alliance, adding the Saudis makes CENTO more legitimate in the region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have been engaged in a struggle for influence in the Arab World. Already radio broadcasts from Egypt have denounced the Saudi decision and calls on Arab masses across the region to take the streets and demand their nations boycott CENTO. With Saudi Arabia onboard, the United States and United Kingdom hope that Arab states sympathetic to Saudi Arabia may also follow suit. Increasingly CENTO appears to be turning into an Islamic NATO."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.10.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government released a statement announcing the appointment of Prince Talal as the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. King Saud has faced immense pressure in recent months over public discontent with his public spending and the rising threat of pan-Arab nationalism being propagated by Egypt and their Nasserist sympathizers across the region. The traditionalist faction within the royal family were said to be pushing the King to appoint a Prime Minister with executive power to control the situation. The choice of Prince Talal raises many eyebrows in Western capitals. Prince Talal leads a faction of princes who are pro-Nasser and advocate a far more liberal line than the traditionalist faction. Prince Talal openly advocates major political reforms and the establishment of a constitution for Saudi Arabia. King Saud appears to have appointed Talal in order to counter-balance the influence of their brother Prince Faisal, who enjoys support from the traditionalists. King Saud also hopes Prince Talal's advocacy of a transition to constitutional governance will take the wind out of those advocating revolution within the kingdom along the Nasserist lines. More importantly, this move appears to have taken the wind out of the traditionalist faction which pushed the king to appoint a Prime Minister. Ultimately, the question will be if Prince Talal can manage his relationship with the king, the traditionalists, especially the Wahabi ulema, and managing expectations as a failure to deliver political reforms may end up further radicalizing a frustrated population. Time will tell if this appointment marks the beginning of a gradual democratic transformation for the kingdom."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.11.d:0 "In Riyadh today, the Republic of Arabia formally joined the United Arab Republic (UAR). In a formal but lavish ceremony. With representatives from friendly governments, senior Republic of Arabia leaders, and representatives from all UAR member states were present. In the conclusion of the ceremony, the UAR president accepted the Republic of Arabia's request to join. As the two men embraced on stage, the assembled guests thundered in applause. This move radically transforms the Middle East. The UAR, through the Republic of Arabia, now controls one of the most valuable resources on the planet in oil. The UAR's rivals for influence in the Arab World are now at a strategic disadvantage as the balance of power has permanently shifted. Both the United States and Soviet Union must contend with the UAR as a rising power. However, with the arrival of the Republic of Arabia, there are some experts who believe this fundamental regional shift also marks a fundamental shift within the UAR. Egypt has long dominated the United Arab Republic but with the Republic of Arabia's economic power and symbolic status as the host of the Islamic holy land, Egyptian domination appears vulnerable. Especially if other member states begin working together. While the UAR celebrates its continued expansion and rival states look on in fear, time will tell if this great experiment in Arab nationalism will continue to march onward."		
 SAU_Focus_Events.12.d:0 "King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia united Arabia with the sword and a close ideological alliance with the Wahabi ulema. Since then the kingdom has been run by the royal family working in conjunction with the ulema to ensure all laws obey God's. In recent years however, the popularity of pan-Arabism espoused by President Gamal Nasser of Egypt has spread across the Arab World. The royal family is not immune to this influence. A number of ideological young princes have united under the leadership of Prince Talal and call themselves the Free Princes, in homage to Nasser's Free Officers. These young princes have rallied around Prince Talal who often brings up the need for more democratic reforms and a constitution to senior members of the family. However, the King and senior ulema no longer have patience with the Free Princes. They are called subversive, secret communists, and in some quarters are viewed as anti-Islam in their push for reforms that challenge the Islamic character of the state. Some have had their assets frozen and most of the Free Princes have fled the country in fear of persecution from the government. Many have arrived in Lebanon and Egypt. The Egyptians are expected to start using prominent princes, especially Prince Talal to broadcast messages against the Saudi state. Although the Free Princes will raise mischief abroad, at least they will not foment unrest within not just the kingdom but the royal family itself."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.13.d:0 "The Saudi Arabian government announced through a statement from the King that it strongly condemned Britain's naked aggression against the people of Egypt. The British long exhibited an arrogant and imperialist attitude towards the Suez. Egypt consistently sought a just resolution while Britain continuously showed no interest in treating the people of Egypt fairly. Instead, the King's statement added, the British plotted with  Egypt's sworn enemies to launch a barbaric attack. The Saudi government would stand with the people of Egypt and called for Arab unity in this time of crisis. To support the Egyptians, the Saudi government additionally announced an oil embargo on aggressor states that would last until the violence against Egypt halted. Although Egypt's revolutionary government appears to be the opposite of the Saudi monarchical state, the two state's shared animosity to the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan appears to unite them. In addition, the Saudis enjoy close ties with the United States and are following their lead in this crisis. Taking a stand against the British will help the Egyptians but pressure the Jordanian government and King who has long been dependent on British support to rule. In issuing this strong stance, Saudi Arabia has once again shown itself as one of the principal leaders of the Arab World."	
 SAU_Focus_Events.14.d:0 "The Saudi government condemned Britain's continued occupation of Aden and decried how colonialism continued to shackle Arabs to Western occupation. The wave of decolonization and rise of Arab nationalism across the Middle East has left many to see Aden as an outpost of an archaic system. For the British, Aden served historically as a key coaling station, anti-piracy base, and trade outpost since the nineteenth century. The amount of trade which passes through the port along with its strategic position as a key component of the British global defense network makes the British hesitant to give up its control of Aden. In addition, Aden oil production is seen as a critical strategic asset. The British see efforts by the Saudis and Egyptians to push them out of Aden as an effort to secure Aden as space to be incorporated by either state or their proxies. For the Saudis, challenging British colonialism helps its reputation across the Arab world but more importantly, it puts pressure on the British to leave. A British withdrawal from Aden would no doubt be a great Arab achievement, but also a potential opportunity for the Saudi state."	

 #Need New Iraqi Event YML
 IRQ.9901.d:0 "The Hashemites have had a long and historical relationship with the Hijaz. The family traces its ancestry to the Prophet and the early Hashimites competed with other factions for the title of Caliph. Within three centuries of Islam's founding, the title of Sharif and Emir of Mecca was given to the Hashimites. The dynasty oversaw the holy land and preserved it for the whole Islamic world. During World War I, Hussein bin Ali and his four sons revolted against the decadent Ottoman Empire after receiving promises from the British it would support a new Arab empire with a Hashimite caliph. These promises were not kept but after the war the Hashimites did establish kingdoms in Jordan, Iraq, and the Hijaz. However, in 1925 the Saudis drove the Hashimites out of their ancestral home in Hijaz. Now the Saudis appear weak, opposition to their rule grows and Hashimite loyalists still in the holy land have started a revolt to end Saudi rule. The Saudi policies of destroying historical relics and undermining the traditional powerbases of Arabia have resulted in a backlash for those who wish for the Hashimites to return. The rebels have appealed to the Hashimite powers of Iraq and Jordan for support. Both are expected to offer arms, volunteers, and diplomatic support. Both rulers have long desired to avenge the humiliation their family suffered in 1925. Saudi arrogance and disrespect for the traditions of Arabia will now cost them as the people flock to restore Hashimite rule."				#The Saudi Civil War
 IRQ.1753.d:0 "Iraq is perhaps the most arbitrarily designed state that emerged from World War I. The British merged three distinct Ottoman provinces to create Iraq. The new state lacked ethnic, religious, or linguistic homogeneity. The Arab majority was divided into Sunnis and Shias. The country had a sizable Kurdish minority concentrated in the north. A sizable Assyrian Christian population existed along with a large Jewish community in Baghdad. The British sought to rule Iraq through treaties with a friendly government to secure its interests and avoid expenses. Faisal ibn Hussein, recently deposed by the French in Syria, was brought by the British to become King Faisal I of Iraq. Despite lacking any connection to the land, King Faisal I proved adept at mediating Iraq's factions and establishing the legitimacy of his dynasty with the people. His death in 1933 brought the inept King Ghazi to the throne. After King Ghazi's death in 1939, the three-year-old King Faisal II took over but power rests with the regent, Prince Abdullah. King Faisal I's early death saw parliament dominated by aging Ottoman-era politicians who constantly rotate power in parliament. The military has overthrown several premiers since Prince Abdullah's regency began, though they have chosen to not overthrow the system.  World War II witnessed the Hashemite's biggest challenge as nationalist army officers seized power. The Hashemites and parliament returned to power only after a British invasion, forever tainting the Hashemite state in the eyes of an increasingly nationalistic population.  The Iraqi state's centralizing policy saw brutal repression as the army suppressed the Kurds and Assyrians. In addition to resistance to centralization, the anti-colonial middle class and leftist agitation among urban workers are all emerging threats to the Hashemite Iraqi state. Time will tell if King Faisal II can end the political uncertainty and restore the people's trust in the dynasty."				
 IRQ.9998.d:0 "Frustration and anger towards the political repression in Iraq and British interference has boiled over to protests and strikes against the monarchy and the 1948 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. For far too long, the protestors believe, Iraq has had its foreign policy dictated by London while the Hashemite dynasty curtailed any expressions of political discourse. In the midst of this unrest, King Faisal II published a public denouncement against the Constitution Party. He says the party has fanned the protestors anger and has sought to provoke a civil war in the name of its own political gains. He says in reality much of what the protestors are complaining about are actually caused by the Constitution Party and because the protests are targeting the royal family, the Constitution Party refuses to help calm the unrest. This condemnation of the Constitution Party has surprised many in Iraq and it remains to be seen if the King's effort to place the blame and responsibility on the Party will aid its ability to calm down the unrest sweeping Iraq."		 
 IRQ.9999.d:0 "The Iraq Central League consists of football teams from clubs and institutions based across Baghdad. Despite being one of four regional leagues in the country, the Iraqi Central League is considered the premier Iraqi football league. Its champions go on to represent Iraq in the Asia Club Championship. The Haris Al-Maliki club is considered the powerhouse club in the country. However, all the matches appear to be popular, as they often attract sold out crowds. In addition, many Iraqis follow the results closely in the media with hopes their team can come out on top. Major institutions like the police and army also field teams giving members of such institutions more reasons to support their team. The Iraqi football love keeps the population happy during the league season and allows rival institutions to resolve their tensions on the pitch instead of on the streets. What a beautiful game it is."		
 IRQ.9996.d:0 "Today, King Faisal II of Iraq achieved his majority and has taken his place as ruler of Iraq. Although he ascended the throne at age 4 in 1939 following the death of King Ghazi, his father, the country had been governed by his regent and pro-British uncle Prince ‘Abd al-llah. King Faisal II started the coronation by traveling in an open carriage led by smartly dressed cavalrymen to attend the Iraqi Majlis. He entered the parliament with troops at attention in ceremonial uniforms, all along European lines. After addressing the Majlis, King Faisal II took the oath of kingship and accepted a pledge of loyalty from the Majlis and Iraqi people by the President of the Senate. Following the ceremony the King attended a massive reception where he hosted notable dignitaries, including the Duke of Gloucester. The European style uniforms and practices throughout the coronation indicates King Faisal II hopes to continue the policies of his uncle. Whether he can contain the rising threat of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism remains uncertain as despite the magnificent ceremony, there were reports of Iraqis from middle class neighborhoods complaining of the coronation's expenses. In working class districts some Iraqis were put off by an event where the King was surrounded by armed guards and not the people of Iraq."				
 IRQ.9995.d:0 "Ali Jawdad al-Ayoubi has long served the Hashemites in Iraq. After serving for Faisal's short-lived Syria regime he followed him to Iraq. He took on major leadership positions and diplomatic posts, including several stints as Prime Minister for Iraq. Al-Ayoubi, a seasoned political leader recognizes the changing global order following the end of World War II. In a dramatic diplomatic maneuver, al-Ayoubi flew to Washington D.C. to personally open an Iraqi embassy in the American capital. The Iraqi government recognizes the British are not the paramount power it once was. If the Hashemites are to survive against the rise of anti-monarchal, pan-Arab nationalism and communist agitation it will need to strengthen its ties with the Americans and the new embassy will be the first step in this process. Media in the US reported local excitement and interest to the senior Iraqi leader's dramatic decision to fly in to personally open an embassy. In Iraq the move is praised as recognizing the global order while anti-monarchists point to this action as Iraq continuing to surrender its sovereignty to colonial forces."	
 IRQ.9980.d:0 "Today, the kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan, have announced to form an Arab Federation, which many see as a response to the United Arab Republic, formed by Egypt and Syria. King Faisal of Iraq and his cousin, King Hussain of Jordan, both descendants of the Hashemite dynasty, that ruled Arabia till 1921, have disclosed that they had long been planning an Arabic union of states. This union, is seen as a direct consequence of Iraq leaving the Baghdad Pact and to ensure the country's independence from their western Arabic counterpart, Egypt.Although a federation by name, many see the new state to be a confederation and has upset a lot of people. The United Arab Republic has yet to make any formal statement on this, though there are reports of Israeli mobilization . Nevertheless, this is a monumental step for the Middle East, and possibly for the world."
 kurdish_conflict.1.d:0 "The Kurds have long resisted efforts from the Iraqi state to implement a strong, central government. The Kurds oppose the pro-Arab nationalist school system, lack of protection for their own language and culture. In addition, they oppose efforts by the state to forcibly settle Kurdish communities and change their modes of life. Iraq has traditionally deployed the army to enforce its will on the Kurds but the cycle of armed violence between both groups has proven costly over the years. A new initiative has arrived to help reduce the animosity between the Kurdish population and government. The Iraqi government will reduce military checkpoints and raids. In addition, educational institutions will allow students to speak Kurdish in school, alongside Arabic. Politically, local officials will be given more discretion in dealing with Kurdish tribal groupings, especially with Kurdish chieftains. Giving them more say in government policy will help them buy into the state while not compromising on centralizing state policies. These concessions can help reduce tensions and once things settle down, we can return to bringing the Kurds into the Iraqi state on our terms."	
 IRQ.9997.d:0 "Tawfiq al-Suwaidi has decided to accept King Faisal II's invitation to form a new government and work with the Hashemites. A brilliant lawyer and former Prime Minister who grew up in the late Ottoman Empire, al-Suwaidi rose to prominence during the British mandate era. Today, he is a seasoned politician and international figure. The Hashemites had hoped his pro-Western leanings would translate to support for their regime but al-Suwaidi has historically proven himself to be a believer in Western principals of representative democracy and individual rights. The Iraqi royal family viewed his previous stints as Prime Minister with suspicion as he allowed political parties to function and directed the interior ministry to relax its operations, particularly against leftists. However, the situation Iraq finds itself in requires strong leadership and a man of al-Suwaidi's experience and reputation outweighs the risks of his lifting government restrictions and surveillance of dubious groups in the country. For Tawfiq al-Suwaidi he has had a long history of clashing with the Hashemites but he too feels the time maybe right for a more successful relationship and perhaps a more democratic Iraq."
 Abadan_Crisis.1.d:0 "The decision of the Iranian government to nationalize its oil in defiance to its treaties and the rage of Britain has sent shockwaves across Iraq. Iraqis have applauded Iran for securing its sovereignty and defying imperialism while recognizing its own government continues to accept colonial British concessions. Many Iraqis now openly call King Faisal II a British stooge. The Iraqi government is very sensitive to this, as anti-British and anti-colonial sentiments are at an all-time high across the country. Anti-British protesters have appeared in cities across the country and are demanding Iraq assert its own sovereignty. Currently, the Iraqi government receives a fixed royalty on oil sales, which many recognize leaves most of the oil wealth ending in in British hands. The government has two options in how it responds to the Abadan Crisis. It can join Iran and nationalize its own oil industry, rallying the masses and demonstrating the King's position as an Iraqi sovereign. However, doing so would provoke significant British and Western ire, ending Iraq's decades long cultivation of such ties and leave Iraq exposed internationally as well as domestically. The second option is to negotiate with the British over the current oil concession and perhaps change the model from one of a fixed annual royalty to a profit-sharing scheme where Iraq makes money on each barrel of oil sold. The British may be receptive to this plan as it would not want to risk losing another major concession and it could placate the protesters."
 IRQ.9902.d:0 "King Faisal II grew up hearing of his family's betrayals by the British and the Saudis. A number of exiles from the Hashimite defeat in 1925 settled in Baghdad and have governed with the Hashimite king. When the Hashimites entered Iraq they had been outsiders and exiles in an alien land but recent events have opened the path for a potential Hashimite return to their ancestral homeland. Saudi Arabia's brutal regime and arrogance has provoked a pro-Hashimite revolt in the holy land. The Jordanians are expected to involve itself closely with the conflict and considering King Faisal II's close ties with his relatives in Jordan, Iraq will also be expected to involve itself. Pro-monarchy groups have taken to the streets of Baghdad to demand Iraq support the anti-Saudi freedom fighters, though some of the media speculate these rallies were sponsored by the royal family. Iraq has pledged diplomatic support to the pro-Hashimite forces in Saudi Arabia and are said to be preparing a program to offer arms and volunteers to the rebels. If the civil war in Saudi Arabia turns against the Saudi family, many feel Iraq may elevate its intervention to a direct military intervention. Saudi planners are concerned about the potential of an Iraqi invasion."
 IRQ.9903.d:0 "The King of Jordan has long felt the sting of humiliation at losing the Hijaz. The kingdom's founder, King Abdullah could do little as the Saudis seized his homeland and caused a stream of Hashimite refugees and supporters to flee to Aman. Since that period, Jordan had evolved from an emirate into a kingdom. It possessed a modern military and the Hashimites enjoyed extensive political power. However, the failure of saving the Hijaz still hurts and many believe it has driven Jordanian desires to secure Jerusalem. Now, news has reached Aman of pro-Hashimite fighters emerging to fight against Saudi rule over the holy land. The anti-Saudi forces have called on the Hashimites and their supporters abroad to offer support. The Jordanian government will not abandon its supporters and orders have been made to offer arms, volunteers, and diplomatic support for the fighters. Descendants of exiles from 1925 have volunteered support and rumors in Aman say Jordanian forces are erecting camps near the Saudi border to support fighters. At the moment, direct military intervention has not occurred but if the Saudi position worsens, many believe the Jordanians may deploy its small but efficient army into the fray."
 IRQ.9994.d:0 "President Gamal Nasser's newly established United Arab Republic (UAR) threatens the entire Arab world. With Egypt and Syria firmly under his control, emboldened Nasserist sympathizers across the region have taken to the streets demanding change. No doubt the first target will be Jordan, governed by a fellow Hashemite king who faces the prospect of a military conflict and an internal uprising inspired by the UAR. To offset this threat, the seasoned Iraqi leader Nuri al-Said has proposed Iraq start an alliance called the Arab Federation with Jordan. Unlike the UAR, the Arab Federation will not eradicate either nation's identity but instead work to unify the foreign policy and defense of both states. Both Hashemite rulers in Iraq and Jordan have long sought to unite their kingdoms but these previous efforts all ended in failure. However, with the UAR threat looming, it is clear neither Iraq nor Jordan can survive alone. King Faisal II has dispatched an Iraqi delegation led by Nuri al-Said to propose the Arab Federation to his cousin, the King of Jordan."
 IRQ.9991.d:0 "In Aman today, the Jordanian government received a high level delegation form Iraq led by senior political leader Nuri al-Said. He brought with him a personal message from King Faisal II of Iraq urging his cousin to join an alliance he calls the Arab Federation. Al-Said explained the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) upended the balance of power in the region and the Hashemite states of Iraq and Jordan must unite to survive this threat. The Iraqi delegation explained the alliance sought to mainly unite both nations foreign policy and defense coordination, not threaten the governance and national identity of either state. After the talks, the Iraqi delegation left Aman and the Jordanian government considered their options. The threat of the UAR on its borders was very real as were the number of UAR sympathizers within Jordan, especially among the Palestinian population. Having an alliance of this type with Iraq would restore balance in the region and fulfill a long-term family ambition for the Jordanian monarchy to unite with Iraq without losing Jordanian identity. On the other hand, Iraq may use the alliance to hijack Jordan's carefully constructed defense and foreign policy. The King weighs his options and after careful consideration he must decide whether to accept the Iraqi proposal for an Arab Federation or reject it."

 OPCASTOR:0 "The airborne operation of Operation Castor has succeeded! In order to create new fortifications in strategic and suppliable areas following Giap's invasion of Laos, paratroopers from the French Foreign Legion airdropped into Dien Bien Phu in Northwestern Vietnam over the past few days in order to establish a fortified hedgehog airhead to continue advancement against the Viet Minh. This staging was met with little resistance, and will be highly useful in attacks and defenses in North Vietnam in the coming months. It is the most massive air operation since the World War."
 VIN_HELL:0 "Following the massive air operation of Operation Castor, General Giap sensed that the Foreign Legion held a weak foothold in Dien Bien Phu. The Viet Minh began to move their forces away from the front line and to the small town in Northwest Vietnam. The guerillas began a series of attacks on Foreign Legion patrols in the area, slowly whittling them down. Over 57 days, the troops held against wave after wave of attacks on their positions until they were eventually repelled.

Tensions rose between the United Arab Republic and Saudi Arabia even further and this attempt is thought to be carried out in fear of Egypt's rising power and the newly formed UAR, uniting Egypt and Syria.

 #Qasim Iraq Events
 Qasim.1.d:0 "For years the Anglo-American owned Iraqi Petroleum Company (IPC) exploited Iraqi oil and its profits for its own benefit. The old regime had been too dependent on the West and sought to accommodate IPC interests when negotiating agreements before the revolution. However, following, the new revolutionary regime of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim decided the era of Iraqi subservience to the IPC must end. Prime Minister Qasim has demanded a large stake in the IPC and that most profits must go to the Iraqi state. The IPC instead refused and in response the Prime Minister directed a massive increase in tariffs to put the pressure on. Today, the government announced the enactment of Law No. 80 to deliver a major blow to the IPC and liberate Iraqi territory from foreign exploitation. The new law seizes 99.5 percent of the land conceded to the IPC over the years by the old regime and halts new oil explorations. No compensation will be given to the IPC and Prime Minister Qasim announced the land would be given to Iraqi farmers as soon as possible. Prime Minister Qasim in one move weakened the IPC, galvanized public support for his regime, and secured land to support the new government's land reform policies."
 Qasim.2.d:0 "Following the successful revolution and liberation of Iraq from the puppets of imperial powers, the Iraqi Free Officers must begin the process of dismantling the last vestiges of colonialism from Iraq. The corrupt monarchy had long been a stooge for British interests and they kept Iraqis tied to them and their dying empire. Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim announced Iraq would no longer keep the Iraqi dinar pegged with the British pound. Instead the dinar will be pegged to the US dollar, though maintaining its original conversion. Iraq had long had its currency controlled by the British, first with the Indian rupee being introduced after World War I and then the creation of the Iraqi dinar at par with the British pound. By removing the sterling currency Iraq abandons the British financial world and ultimately makes the currency more competitive as the dollar has quickly become the global currency of the twentieth century." 
 Qasim.3.d:0 "Following the Iraqi Revolution, Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim, the leader of the Iraqi Free Officers, announced the abolishment of the monarchy and formation of the Republic of Iraq. The revolution has now politically destroyed an institution it physically decimated during the revolution when the Free Officers oversaw the mass execution of senior royal family members and their supporters. As a new constitutional framework develops, it will be along the lines of a republican government. For many Iraqis the monarchy represented imperial control over the country. Throughout Iraq's history the King constantly sided with the British over the Iraqi people. Within the military this was most acute during the Anglo-Iraq War of 1941 when the Hashemites backed the British invasion of Iraq to crush the pro-Axis government. In the monarchy, the interests of the elites and their backers dominated governance, now as a republic, power would return to the Iraqi people."  
 Qasim.4.d:0 "The Iraqi government under Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim announced the ratification of the Interim Constitution. The new constitution approved in a referendum and presented by the cabinet declares Iraq a republic. Islam will be the official religion and the document calls for Iraq to be ruled by Arabs and Kurds together. Executive authority lies with the three-member Presidency Council and this is overseen by the legislative Ministerial Council. Finally, the judiciary is to remain independent from politics and should preserve Iraqi citizens their rights. Significantly, the constitution affirms Iraq's status as an Arab League member but calls for Iraqi identity to not be divided by ethnicity as it provides equal status to Arabs and Kurds. More importantly, the constitution places citizens as the source of authority for the whole nation, in stark contrast to the monarchical era where sovereignty rested in the royal family and power was kept among those at the very top. For the Kurds the new government has already announced its intentions to provide amnesty to Kurdish fighters from the uprisings in the 1940s as a sign that Arabs and Kurds will run Iraq as equals. Schools have also been asked to accept Kurdish as an official language for the classroom alongside Arabic. Despite the concentration of power resting with the two councils, Iraqis are optimistic the new constitution and guaranteed individual rights will usher a golden age for Iraqi political and social development."
 CENTO.2.d:0 "News of the Iraqi revolution sent shockwaves across the capitals and military headquarters of Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) members. Iraq had been a founding member and as an Arab state was critical for efforts to advertise the alliance in the region. Arab nationalist propaganda long called CENTO an imperialist project and this pressure hurt the alliance's ability to attract more members. The Iraqi Free Officers who bloodily overthrew the monarchy are ardent Arab nationalists and they have announced the new government would withdraw from all previous international alliances, including CENTO. As the alliance is headquartered in Baghdad, the new Iraqi government demanded it be evacuated, Turkey has offered to host the alliance in Ankara. The withdrawal of Iraq greatly weakens the alliance but the failure of the Americans or British to protect the Iraqi monarchy from this coup has also led to rumblings about whether the alliance offers any benefits. Several states are said to be considering if the benefits of working in CENTO outweigh the risks of incurring internal unrest or foreign interference. Time will tell if this action marks the beginning of the end for CENTO."    
 Qasim.5.d:0 "The incredibly popular Kurdish leader and fighter Mustafa Barzani and his supporters arrived in Iraq today. The government of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim invited the Kurdish revolutionary to emphasize the seriousness of his government's proposals to forge a new Iraqi identity based on a shared Arabic-Kurdish cultural identity. The two leaders met with smiles and many Iraqis were thrilled at the sight of a senior Iraqi military officer and senior Kurdish guerilla fighter together as partners. For Qasim the move makes a lot of sense as he faces increasing pressure from more radical Arab officers in the military who want Iraq to embrace an Arab nationalist vision and unite the country with other Arab nationalists. More importantly, Barzani can help secure the acceptance of the new revolutionary government by the Kurdish people. For Barzani, his arrival and amnesty in Iraq has ended his long exile from Kurdistan and hopes to use Qasim to help him consolidate his political position within Kurdistan. The move highlights Arab-Kurdish unity to Iraq's citizens but for Qasim it blunts the radical Arab nationalist threat to his power and for Barzani it gives him a powerful ally in Baghdad he can work with as he consolidates power in Kurdistan. Whether this arrangement will last between the two remains to be seen as both men are ambitious and will not react kindly if they suspect betrayal."    
 KuwaitDemands.1.d:0 "The Republic of Iraq has actively withdrawn from its commitments with us and are pushing Iraq into closer ties with the communist world. In the latest sign of Iraq's increasingly hostile attitude, its leader, Abd al-Karim Qasim announced he planned to incorporate Kuwait into Iraq. Iraq claims Kuwait was historically part of the Ottoman province of Basra and thus an integral part of Iraq. We have reports of a military buildup on the Iraq-Kuwaiti border and have received word Iraq expects a response from us regarding their demand for Kuwait. Intelligence notes Qasim is motivated to make these demands in order to garner support of Arab nationalist officers within a politically divided Iraqi officer class. The Kuwaitis themselves invoked our treaty obligation to defend the country in the face of threats but ultimately it is for us to decide whether to get involved. Choosing to support Kuwait's freedom from Iraq will help keep its strategic oil resources in friendly hands but cost us the deployment of military assets. It would also force Iraq to either invade or backdown. Though Qasim wants the support of nationalist officers, it is unclear if he will risk a war and his regime to get such support. Consenting to Iraq's demands will save us from having to commit assets in a foreign theatre but we will probably lose access to Kuwaiti oil fields. For Qasim our acceptance will strengthen his regime but this may prove beneficial as he is not likely to embrace the pan-Arab nationalists totally and can be expected to likely resist pan-Arab unification efforts in the region. We must now decide whether to reject Iraq's territorial demands and guarantee Kuwait or consent to Iraq's supposed historical claims to Kuwait."
 KuwaitDemands.2.d:0 "The British government announced it would back Kuwait and rejected Iraqi demands on Kuwait as baseless. The British Prime Minister is said to be consulting with his senior military staff to devise contingency plans for the crisis in Kuwait. This turn of events is no doubt a major blow to our just claims for Kuwait and the spreading of Arab liberation to another people's oppressed by a decadent monarchy bloated by its imperial masters. Our military officers are divided on how to respond, certainly the hawkish nationalists are telling the leadership we commit to our demands and take Kuwait by force. A rapid war of conquest can secure Kuwait before Britain arrives and once, they see the new status quo they will have to concede to the new reality. Our public proclamations have galvanized this part of the military and the general population as pro-government and pro-War rallies have taken place across the country. However, on the other side the other officer factions point out the disaster of the 1941 Anglo-Iraq War and that we could not expect the British to just back down once hostilities began. They suggest it would be reckless to sacrifice the Iraqi revolution and its tremendous gains just for public support and Kuwait with their backwards population. We must decide on whether to push forward with our demands and secure Kuwait forcibly, risking a major military conflict. Or if we should maintain our claim but reject a military solution and de-escalate the situation but at the cost of public humiliation and hostility from the Arab nationalist regimes in the region" 
 KuwaitDemands.3.d:0 "The British government announced upon reviewing our just claims they agree and will begin the process of handing over Kuwait to Iraqi sovereignty. The Iraqi government thanked the British for their honesty and across Iraq mass rallies in support of the government have occurred. Across the Arab World the Republic of Iraq is now seen as a great revolutionary government committed to liberating all Arabs from decadence and imperialism. The tiny Kuwaiti military forces have stood down as our jubilant forces drove into Kuwait City to begin the handover process. The local British and Kuwaiti military officials stood down and formally handed administration over to our forces. There are news of sporadic rioting and shootings by our forces but our commanders in Kuwait insist they have the situation under control. We will soon be dispatching civil officials and a new military governor to oversee the integration of Kuwait to Iraq. Certainly our government now enjoys massive public support but more importantly, the divisions within our own military have calmed down as all factions now recognize the great leadership demonstrated by our success"   
 MosulUprising.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim has increasingly relied on the support of the Iraqi Communist Party to blunt the influence of the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party. The Arab nationalists, especially from within the military, continue to agitate for Iraq to integrate itself with the United Arab Republic (UAR). These developments saw tensions rise between both factions across Iraq. After hearing about coup plots being hatched by Arab nationalist officers in Mosul, Qasim encouraged communists to march in a show of force. This led to street clashes between the two sides in Mosul and the deployment of local army units against the communists. Amidst the chaotic violence, the commander of the Mosul garrison, the Colonel Abdel Wahab Shawaf decided to attempt a coup against Qasim with support from nationalist officers and the UAR. Shawaf's forces executed communist leaders, took over the Mosul radio station, kidnapped a British oil technician, and called on sympathetic tribes and military units to join him. The coup attempt quickly failed as military support from other units failed to materialize and Qasim easily organized forces from Baghdad to breakup the rebellion, though Radio Mosul propagated the Ba'ath Pary nationalist agenda. As the plot began failing, Colonel Shawaf was killed by his own men but the violence did not end as government forces arrived in Mosul to retaliate against the rebel troops and nationalists for their actions. Although Prime Minister Qasim did not really face a major challenge to his power, the UAR's support for the coup, has raised tensions between the two states. The communists were strengthened while the Ba'ath Party's Arab nationalist agenda gained a major platform. Both consequences ultimately weaken Qasim's position as he does not wish to become communist nor does he want to embrace the pan-Arab vision espoused by the Ba'ath."

 RamadanRevolution.1.d:0 "The tumultuous reign of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim came to a bloody end today. After three days of fighting, the Iraqi Ba'ath Party along with allies in the military released pictures of the bullet-ridden body of Qasim to the public. This announcement marks the end of the coup and confirms Colonel Abdul Salam Arif as Iraq's new leader. Prime Minister Qasim came to power after leading the military in overthrowing the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy. Qasim however, struggled to assert his authority and curtail the influence of multiple factions in the country. He long sought to use the communists as a counter-balance to pan-Arab nationalist fervor in Iraq. Yet his fear of communists meant he often purged the communists as well, leaving his base divided and weak. This political weakness and constant balancing were further hindered by Iraq's economic challenges and Qasim's mishandling of foreign affairs, especially with regards to Kuwait. The Iraqi Ba'ath Party recognized these weaknesses and after allying itself with pan-Arab officers, they decided to act. On the first morning of the coup, the communist head of the air force was assassinated and troops moved to secure Baghdad. Qasim and his supporters, including communists, resisted for three days before Qasim surrendered. The assassination and Qasim's purges meant the communist could not mobilize effectively which ultimately cost Qasim his life. Many analysts suggest the new regime may embrace pan-Arab nationalism and quickly move to achieve these goals. Rumors from Baghdad suggest soldiers are rounding up communist sympathizers across the city, further solidifying Ba'ath influence."
 RamadanRevolution.2.d:0 "Husain al-Radi announced on the radio that the Iraqi Communist Party has defeated the nationalist coup and will now administer the country. This marks the end of a bold coup attempt led by pan-Arab nationalist officers and the Ba'ath Party against the regime of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim. The Ba'athis had sought to end Qasim and communist sympathizers by beginning the coup with an assassination attempt on the communist chief of the air force, Jalal al-Awqati, this attempt failed. When rebel tanks moved to seize the radio station they were stunned to see Iraqi air force planes come in to stop their advance while communist sympathizers secured the station. In the ensuing violence the pro-Ba'ath military units overpowered the pro-Qasim forces, leading to Qasim's death in Baghdad. However, the Ba'ath failed to capitalize as they did not control the radio stations and their efforts to secure key sites were hindered by the establishment of communist strongholds across pro-communist neighborhoods in Baghdad. Without clear news regarding a Ba'ath victory, nervous Iraqi troops across the country began returning to their barracks while others joined the communist fighters operating out of their strongholds. The Ba'athist coup soon failed due to a lack of momentum and the communists emerged from their strongholds to declare victory. Ba'ath leadership is said to have gone underground and Husain al-Radi is expected to soon announce the Iraqi Communist Party's program for economic and social transformation."
 RamadanRevolution.3.d:0 "Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim addressed the media with several detained senior Ba'ath and pan-Arab military officers standing behind him. Just five days earlier the officers and Ba'ath Party supporters launched a vicious coup to end Qasim's rule and push the country on a more pan-Arab path. Despite initially assassinating the communist air chief and seizing control of the country's radio station, the plotters ultimately failed to consider Qasim's popularity among Iraqis. Qasim long sought to play is base of supporters against one another and purge groups like the communists when they appeared too powerful, greatly hindering the ability of his supporters to mobilize support. However, Qasim's recent success with regards to Kuwait galvanized Iraqis and once the communists spread word of the coup, pro-Qasim forces and the communists saw scores of volunteers show up. The movement of Ba'ath forces and allies were also hindered in multiple pro-Qasim neighborhoods. All this allowed Qasim to rally his supporters and following his counter-attack, the Ba'ath forces virtually disintegrated, securing Qasim's victory. In his address Qasim thanked the Iraqi people for their aid and declared Iraq's revolutionary path will not be hindered by those forces who seek to destroy the unity of Iraq."

 Aktion_Harpune.1.d:0 "With the Social Democratic victory in the 1953 West German elections, the Western Powers began to express increasing concern over the government's conciliatory view towards East Germany. Despite the end of the Stalin Notes, Erich Ollenhauer's government reportedly launched several probes into reviving the prospect of a neutral reunification between the two nations. Whilst being initially proposed as a buffer state - involving the leaving of all Western troops, the Western Powers insisted that it would be incredibly prone to Soviet influence, and effectively act as another Russian satellite state. However, the SPD's willingness to enter talks with the East Germans clearly angered the United States, with West German media leaking transmissions between Ollenhauer and the White House containing the implied threat of a renewed military occupation in the event of further non-cooperation. However, in a rapid escalation, the West German capital of Bonn has been rocked in a violent coup orchestrated by local army units against Ollenhauer's government.\n While the city was consumed in fighting for hours, a broad Conservative coalition led by Heinrich Hellweg has assumed power in Bonn, executing Ollenhauer and heading a new provisional government which has already cut all ties with the Eastern Bloc. The US government has been quick to recognise and announce its support for Hellweg's new regime, while minor diplomatic protests from East Germany have been sidelined. As the coalition is made up of ex-Wehrmacht officers, Conservatives, Monarchists and Nationalists, the future of the young Democracy is now uncertain, with former SS ties of many members of the coalition being brought into question by media across the Western democracies. This seems to have had little effect, however, and Hellweg's coalition continues to rule over West Germany effectively unopposed, while his ‘German Party' has already begun."

Despite the end of the Stalin Notes, Erich Ollenhauer's government reportedly launched several probes into reviving the prospect of a neutral reunification. While being initially proposed as a buffer state - involving the leaving of NATO, the Western Powers insisted that it would be incredibly prone to Soviet influence, and would effectively act as another Russian client state. However, the SPD's willingness to enter talks with the East Germans clearly angered the United States, with West German media leaking transmissions between Ollenhauer and the White House containing the implied threat of a renewed military occupation in the event of further non-cooperation. However, in a rapid escalation, the West German capital of Bonn has been rocked in a violent coup orchestrated by local army units against Ollenhauer's government.\n While the city was consumed in fighting for hours, it now appears that forces led by former Wehrmacht colonel Walter Kopp have seized control of the apparatus of government and ousted the Social Democrats. Citing a treasonous betrayal of national security, Kopp had Ollenhauer executed in front of a large crowd in the center of Bonn, and has been set up as the head of an interim government which has already reaffirmed its commitment to NATO and has broken all diplomatic ties with the Eastern Bloc. The United States has been quick to formally recognise the new government, while concerns have already been raised by international media over Kopp's rumoured connections to both the CIA and former Nazi groups. His new government has already taken steps reminiscent of Hitler's rise to power in 1933, while the US government has been actively supporting Kopp's increasingly dictatorial regime. Despite a formal diplomatic protest by East Germany, it now appears that Kopp has cemented his control over West Germany and planted the seeds for a renewed age of authoritarianism."

 VINLAO.1.d:0 "Urgent news have arisen, it seems that North Vietnam has seized in the Tchepone district near the DMZ between North and South Vietnam. Hanoi claims that the villages had historically been a part of Vietnam for centuries. Soon enough, widespread fighting was seen all over the border with North Vietnam-Laos. The Vietnamese tactics were intended to open a trail in the Xepon District, in what was to be known was the Ho Chi Minh Trail."
 Pathet_Lao.1.d:0 "A new movement has risen in Laos. The Lao People's Party, later called the Pathet Lao, is a Marxist-Leninist guerilla movement that has been created by Prince Souphanouvong, who met Ho Chi Minh and has close ties with the Viet Minh. Originating from the Lao Issara, the anti-French and non-communist nationalist movement was adopted by Souphanouvong, who joined the Viet Minh's revolt against the French in the First Indochina War. Many claim that the Pathet Lao are a mere extension of the Vietnamese communists, while others claim that it is an independent movement that is dedicated to the liberation of Lao from capitalist and American elements; Laos is now divided between the Monarchists and the Communists and few can wager if the nation itself can support the infighting."
 
 VIN_Reform.1.d:0 "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced that it will begin a series of land reforms in order to benefit the peasantry and the rural workers; while initially adopting a moderate stance and compromising with the landlords in regards to the lands, with a simple reduction in land rent, the North Vietnamese government has started a more hardline and radical reform, being inspired by the Chinese. Deeming landlords as traitorous elements of the cause and forming a special people's tribunal court; most of which are composed by peasants with little to no expertise regarding law and dishing out arbitrary sentences that vary from death penalty to a few years of harsh labor. Furthermore, a series of decrees and laws on land reform has been released, detailing the last phase of the land revolution, the redistribution of agricultural land."
 VIN_Reform.2.d:0 "After the radicalization of the land reform by elements of the Communist Party of Vietnam, it hasn't taken long for the executions and the social isolation of landlords to begin. With a Politburo document being released that details that one per a thousand people of the total population must be executed, on the grounds of them being landlords or otherwise collaborating with landlords; it has been estimated that fifteen thousand reactionaries and landlords are dead. The VWP has thus far started a campaign on the rectification of errors after the execution of these landlords, many of which have been falsely or wrongly sentenced to death. With a three-phase operation, it has re-classified peasants and has restituted property that has been erroneously expropriated or otherwise making suitable compensation for those mistakes; furthermore, there has been a review, inventory and concentrated re-indoctrination of local personnel."
 VIN_Reform.3.d:0 "The Central Committee of North Vietnam has recently denounced that the ideology that is followed in the People's Republic of China; according to the leadership of North Vietnam, the concepts of Maoism are a clear deviation and revisionism of the ideology that is followed in the nation, Marxism-Leninism; the Vietnamese have announced a reorientation to the USSR while relations with Beijing have soured significantly; the PRC has announced that the decision of North Vietnam is regretful and that it is a shame that North Vietnam has chosen to be a blatant revisionist and reactionary nation, we hope that they can reorient their course of action as soon as possible. It remains to be seen whether Vietnam will continue its pro-Soviet course."
 
 #KMT Burma
 KMT_BURMA.1.d:0 "After the fall of the mainland to troops loyal to Mao Zedong, an insurgency was established in Burma by Li Mi, a Nationalist general that had formed the backbone of what was to become the Yunnan Province Anticommunist National Salvation Army, which was supported by both Taiwan and the United States. As Chinese forces started to mount troops in the border with Korea, the Americans urged the Nationalist insurgents to mount an attack on the province of Yunnan, tying the PRC on a conflict with these insurgents while also presenting itself as a key to a renewed Nationalist attack into the mainland, which would break the Maoist forces and bringing China into control of Chiang Kai-Shek once again. As soon as these troops set themselves inside Yunnan, they would capture airfields that would allow American forces to send supplies in order to maintain the invasion; while Li Mi was more dedicated to use the incursion into Yunnan as a key to receive American weaponry, retreat into Burma and fortify the insurgency. Whether any of these plans will succeed is but a mystery to both the general that commands the Insurgency, and the Generalissimo in Taiwan."
 KMT_BURMA.2.d:0 "After the fall of Nationalist China, a beaten back KMT army was retreating from the mainland, stuck in Yunnan; the army of T'ang Yao was composed of 30,000 troops and gradually lost most of the personnel to desertion, mass surrenders or fall to pursuing Communist formations. 1,500 of these troops found themselves in a remote corner of Burma's Shan State. These 1,500 men bolstered by over 20,000 militia mainly from the local Wa Christian population and Shan mercenaries have begun a military operation into Yunnan, beating back the communist garrison forces and establishing a new Kuomintang insurgency in the PRC."

Originating with the idea that a popular uprising could occur due to the PRC's radical collectivization efforts, the eight army commander levied 400 men from Lü Wei-ying, a commander of the first army, to attack Yunnan; Lin's belief was that an attack on Yunnan would receive the support and admiration of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. As the 400 men moved into Yunnan, motivated and commanded by Lin and Lü, they dispersed the local communist militias and established a local Kuomintang insurgency in Yunnan."

Originating with the idea that a popular uprising could occur due to the PRC's radical collectivization efforts, the eight army commander levied 400 men from Lü Wei-ying, a commander of the first army, to attack Yunnan; being suspended for a considerable amount of time, it took months for Lin Yuan-lin to resume the operation, jumpstarting it after skipping orders from his commanders in hopes of receiving the admiration and support of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. As the men moved into Yunnan, they did not have the motivation to truly fight and begin their insurgency, leading to a quick defeat by communist militias, sending them and Lin, back to Burma."
 
 KMT_BURMA.10.d:0 "The situation of the KMT in Burma is gradually becoming delicate, with pressure from the United Nations to Taiwan, slowly making it remove the troops in the sovereign southeast Asian nation that is suffering from political instability due to in-fighting between KMT insurgents and Burmese communist insurgents and due to the fact that this insurgent army is meddling inside the opium trade, spreading corruption and drug addictions. It was due to this pressure that the Republic of China decided to begin ‘Operation Heaven'. With these forces being adamant on a very small reduction of the insurgent army, tensions were high, but it was eventually agreed that there should be an evacuation of KMT troops from Burma; with months of negotiations, the KMT began a three-phase withdrawal that was half-hearted, with the supposed Chinese evacuees looking like Shans or Lahus, from Burma, with rusting museum pieces instead of modern American military weaponry. A dissolution of the KMT insurgency was declared, but 6,000 irregular KMT troops remained in Burma, where fighting began a month later."

 insurgency_1256_desc:0 "Portugal has proudly administered Guinea-Bissau since 1446. As of 1952 the territory is now an extension of the Portuguese nation, making its people, land, and blood our own. Despite our efforts at maintaining law and order, a leftist conspiracy has taken root. The so-called African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) was created by some local intellectuals and have sought to provoke conflict with our government and the people of Guinea-Bissau. The PAIGC manipulated dockworkers into striking in 1959 and through the provocation initiated by the PAIGC, they forced the government to put down these strikers by any means. The PAIGC exploited this to raise support but were still not really a threat. The desperate group recently started sabotaging bridges, telegraph lines, and looting isolated administrative posts but this was just the action of a desperate group. Now news has arrived that the leftist party sent its fighters to attack an army garrison south of Bissau, in addition reports have filtered in of armed guerrilla fighters moving in the countryside. In its last desperate gamble PAIGC has resorted to an armed struggle, but the Portuguese nation and military will be more than up to the task of squashing this nuisance."
 insurgency_1257_desc:0 "The territory of Guinea-Bissau was claimed as early as 1446 by Portugal though it would take them until the nineteenth century, with the advance of new technologies and medicine, to occupy the interior. In 1952 the Portuguese passed a constitutional amendment changing the territory from a colony to a province and thus an extension of the Portuguese mainland. Resistance had always been present but in 1956, Amiilcar Carbal and Rafael Barbosa founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), making it the first organized resistance party of the colony. In 1959 they organized a major strike of dockworkers but the Portuguese police brutally suppressed the workers, killing dozens. PAIGC support increase dramatically in the aftermath. Despite the growth of PAIGC, the Portuguese authorities refused to treat them as a major threat. However, this changed in 1961 when the PAIGC, began a sabotage campaign against the Portuguese army, targeting its infrastructure. This has changed into open warfare as the PAIGC launched an attack on the army garrison located south of Bissau. What the Portuguese thought was a minor leftist nuisance has evolved into a guerrilla army openly waging war."

The Portuguese sought to nip the unrest with force but instead the PAIGC to escalate its own tactics. By the early 1960s the PAIGC had initiated a brutal guerrilla war against the Portuguese.

 GBN_1_desc:0 "A field officer reported to headquarters his unit had discovered an enemy encampment nearby and believed this was were a number of attacks against his unit were being conducted from. He asked for permission to assault the position and this was granted. The overconfident PAIGC commander in the camp had failed to setup defensive positions and our troops easily overcame the rebel positions. A number of enemy fighters were killed and captured during the operation, along with enemy equipment and documents. Our intelligence hopes to use the captured documents to uproot other PAIGC cells in the area."
 GBN_2_desc:0 "A battalion commander's local operation to uproot a PAIGC cell and dismantle enemy support infrastructure in local villages has ended in complete failure. It appears the PAIGC had been prepared for such an operation or had informants give up operational details. Our forces raid into suspected enemy villages yielded no intelligence or caches of supplies. As our troops returned to base, they faced enemy ambushes and sniper fire, we suffered casualties. The failure to achieve any of our objectives and the casualties has weakened our morale and the PAIGC can be expected to gain more support in the area."
 GBN_3_desc:0 "A local commander and his cadre of fighters discovered a local Portuguese army camp was lax in security and appeared undermanned. After planning and rallying fighters in the area, our commander launched a raid on this camp. The enemy was completely unprepared for the assault and after a brief fight the camp was overrun with minimum losses. Significantly, the camp had caches of arms, supplies, and several prisoners were taken. No doubt this success will strengthen our presence in the area and demonstrate our resolve to continue the struggle for independence."
 GBN_4_desc:0 "An aggressive commander and his fighters acted on intelligence from a local of a vulnerable Portuguese army operating base in the area. Sensing the opportunity to deliver a blow to the enemy, the commander ordered the attack. However, it appears the informant was working with the enemy and the raiders were ambushed on their way in, resulting in heavy casualties and a counter-attack which saw our local camp to be seized. Documents, equipment, prisoners, and heavy casualties were taken in this failed raid. This will no doubt help enemy morale and degrade our own."

 op_green_sea_fail_desc:0 "At nightfall, November 21st, 1970. Four landing crafts from the Portugese navy transferred some 420 men, to Conakry, to rescue 26 prisoners held at the compound, however, once landed on shore, the Guinean soldiers quickly turned on our soldiers, an intense firefight ensues with PAIGC guerillas quickly reinforcing the 200 defected soldiers, our soldiers were quickly forced to retreat and abandon the mission, suffering 52 casualties, the 26 prisoners were moved into another desolate prison or so we heard, god help them...as long as this war continues they won't ever see the light of day."

 paigc_defeat_desc:0 "The Portuguese initial reaction to the peaceful protests and worker strikes led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) was to initiate a brutal crackdown. The colonial authorities felt a strong show of force would cow the people of Guinea to obedience. This tactic backfired as the PAIGC instead organized an insurgency, forcing Portugal to deploy more troops and to spend heavily from its limited resources. The PAIGC enjoyed support from neighboring states and locals. Portuguese forces initially struggled to contain the guerrilla fighters, but a series of reforms changed this. The Portugal colonial authorities invested heavily in establishing public services for locals while the military adjusted its tactics to launch mobile, small-scale raids targeting the PAIGC cadres. The Portuguese recognized the conflict would be one of attrition and overtime the locals began turning on the PAIGC or grew tired of the fighting. In addition, the PAIGC suffered heavily from the new tactics, hurting morale, especially after several major cross-border raids which killed senior rebel leaders in neighboring states. Last night, in the Guinean capital of Bissau, the Portuguese colonial and military leadership signed a surrender agreement with PAIGC leaders. Across the colony armed fighters have began emerging from the bush to surrender their weapons to colonial security personnel. Although the costs were high, Portugal has demonstrated its will and desire to stay the course with a colonial empire."
 paigc_win_desc:0 "The Portuguese initial reaction to the peaceful protests and worker strikes led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) was to initiate a brutal crackdown. The colonial authorities felt a strong show of force would cow the people of Guinea to obedience. This tactic backfired as the PAIGC instead organized an insurgency, forcing Portugal to deploy more troops and to spend heavily from its limited resources. The PAIGC from the beginning were able to launch lighting fast guerrilla raids and expand operations throughout the colony. Locals inspired by the global wave of decolonization along with a dislike to harsh Portuguese tactics swelled the PAIGC ranks. In addition, neighboring states also provided aid which put heavy pressure on Portuguese forces. Portuguese forces did adapt their tactics and sought reforms to turn the tide against the PAIGC. However, despite improving their military performance, it was still not enough to stop the growth and effectiveness of the PAIGC. After recognizing it no longer could continue the course, the Portuguese government and PAIGC leadership signed an agreement in Algiers today. The war has ended and Portugal will withdraw its forces, leaving Guinea for the PAIGC."

 portugal_raid_sen_desc:0 "The Senegalese government has long supported the PAIGC and its operations, allowing its territory to act as a base of operation and training camp for PAIGC fighters. After a border post came under heavy fire from PAIGC fighters who quickly withdrew back to Senegal, our local commander ordered an airborne unit to prepare an operation to pursue and eliminate the enemy base in Senegal. The resulting operation caught the enemy completely off-guard as they did not expect an attack over the border. Our forces inflicted heavy casualties, seized prisoners and documents. The Senegalese authorities have kept mute so far."
 portugal_raid_fail_sen_desc:0 "Following a series of successful attacks on our border posts next to the Senegalese border, our local forces decided to retaliate and attack. Our forces assembled on the border and after a lengthy assembly period, crossed to destroy PAIGC operating bases. However, the PAIGC were prepared, we believe they tracked the assembly of forces and once our forces crossed, they found abandoned camps. Upon returning back to our territory, they faced rebel attacks and took casualties. The PAIGC and Senegalese have used images of our destroyed equipment as evidence of Portuguese aggression."

 portugal_raid_gna_desc:0 "PAIGC fighters and leaders have enjoyed safe havens in Guinea. Their forces have been able to train, plan, and rest in the safety of Guinean territory. A mid-level officer in Bissau came up with a plan to raid enemy camps across the border. Once the plan was approved and accepted by higherups, the operation was put into play. Stunned PAIGC fighters and commanders were killed and captured in high numbers, including many untrained recruits. Our forces suffered minimal losses and the success will hurt enemy recruitment and with the number of documents captured, we will hope to destroy more enemy positions."
 portugal_raid_fail_gna_desc:0 "Horrible news arrived in the capital of Bissau today. An overzealous unit deployed near the Guinea border decided to expand the scope of their planned raid on suspected local PAIGC camps to include suspected camps across the border in Guinea. The resulting operation saw the unit take high casualties as it faced enemy ambushes once it crossed into Guinea. The failure of the operation and the losses we suffered in Guinea is being used as propaganda to support the Guinean government and the PAIGC. The regional states are also condemning our operations."

 expulsion_of_paigc_gna_desc:0 "When the Portuguese authorities initially cracked down on African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) by killing protesting dock workers, the PAIGC leadership fled to neighboring Guinea. The Guinean government had ideological, socialist alignment with the PAIGC and its capital Conakry became the PAIGC headquarters. Guinea provided arms, training, supplies, bases, and training camps. From bases in Guinea PAIGC fighters could target Portuguese forces across the entire eastern and southern border of the colony. Portuguese protests and anger did not stop the Guinean government's support for the PAIGC. This however, has changed as Portugal recently shifted its tactics. Citing the right of hot pursuit, Portuguese forces started raiding and assaulting PAIGC bases within Guinea. Guinean forces at the camps and civilians in the crossfire suffered heavily. In addition, the Portuguese launched air strikes and even raided Conakry to target senior PAIGC officials. Under this immense pressure, the Guinean government announced it would expel the PAIGC from their territory. They cited the failure of the PAIGC as a military force and accused its members of trying to seize Guinea for themselves. These allegations have not been proven and many see it as a means to save face for caving to Portuguese demands."
 expulsion_of_paigc_sen_desc:0 "Like most post-colonial states, Senegal is strongly devoted to anti-colonial causes and in addition its leadership espouses pan-Africanism. When the Portuguese authorities initially cracked down on African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in its early days, some PAIGC leaders fled to Senegal, which borders the colony's north. As the PAIGC evolved from a political protest movement into an armed insurgency, the Senegalese offered arms, supplies, and training camps within the safety of its borders. Supporting the PAIGC fit the Senegalese aspirations for supporting anti-colonialism and offering its territory gave the PAIGC a safe base of operations. PAIGC fighters could easily strike across northern Portuguese Guinea and then retreat to the safety of Senegal. Portuguese protests over Senegal's actions had been ignored but this has all changed recently. The Portuguese forces, using the right of hot pursuit have begun raiding and assaulting PAIGC camps across the border. These aggressive tactics and devastating raids also caused the Senegalese to suffer casualties. Facing the risk of a potential war and disappointed with the PAIGC's failure to respond effectively to these attacks, Senegal announced it will expel the PAIGC from its territory. It cited the PAIGC for conducting “reckless” actions which endangered Senegalese interests and claimed PAIGC fighters were interfering with the affairs of Senegalese locals."
 americo_liberian_minority_rule_desc:0 "Immigrants of former slaves from the United States and their descendants, Americo-Liberians have, despite being a minority, continuously dominated the political, social, and economic life of Liberia since the country's foundation in 1847. The indigenous people grow restless with the limited voting franchise and what is perceived as laws perpetuating discrimination, leading to societal tensions. Despite this, the Americo-Liberians continue to insist it is only through them that Liberia can achieve prosperity and modernity."

 PRC_Dispute.1.d:0 "The British Raj negotiated its boundaries along the Himalaya's with Tibet and China. Following the takeover of Tibet by the PRC, the new regime decided to void many of these treaties, arguing that the Tibetan government had no legitimacy to negotiate treaties. The Chinese move to develop roads and troop posts in disputed areas led to strong Indian protests and troop deployments. The tensions are focused in Aksai Chin and the North East Frontier Agency. In Aksai Chin a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was established to separate Chinese from Indian forces but recently the Indian Army initiated a Forward Policy. However, the conflict has expanded into a full-on border clash as Chinese forces have begun surrounding some of these posts while the Indian Army appears poised to send troops to secure its posts and disputed clash. As both India and China rush troops to the conflict zone, the world waits to see what will result and whether this border violence will escalate to a broader conflict."
 PRC_Dispute.2.d:0 "The Chinese government announced it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in its conflict with India after it drove Indian forces out of the disputed territories along the Himalayas. From the beginning of the conflict, the Indian Army's Forward Policy in the disputed territories failed to disrupt Chinese forces. Instead, Indian border posts were overwhelmed and Indian forces collapsed in the face of Chinese infiltration tactics. New Delhi has reacted in shock with India's government pleading with Western powers to aid it and prevent a Chinese invasion. Although China appears to have halted its ambitions to just the border areas, India remains apprehensive an escalation could lead to a complete military collapse. Washington and London have both shown equal concern to the communist threat. Observers believe India will likely receive aid to replenish its losses but India's pride has been humbled by its disastrous performance. Military leaders in Pakistan are said to be watching these developments with glee."
 PRC_Dispute.3.d:0 "Since 1945, the People's Liberation Army has appeared almost unstoppable in achieving its objectives. However, following the Chinese government's request for a ceasefire and discussions with India, it has become clear the Indian Army has prevailed in the recent border conflict in the Himalaya's. India will no doubt seek to secure its claims and are likely to succeed as Chinese forces are said to have been driven out of the disputed lands. The Indian Army's Forward Policy has proven to be very successful. Indian forces successfully ambushed Chinese forces in the area and the professional training and leadership was said to have been instrumental in India's success over what Western observers considered a “peasant army”. Domestically, the Indian government has asserted its strength to its people and have shown the world India did not need to rely on foreign powers to protect itself from its enemies. In Beijing, a lot of soul searching and analysis must be done, though the government has proven successful in suppressing news of the military setbacks to the population."
 SINO_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government's dangerous game of interfering with Tibet and deploying its forces into Chinese territory has been met with a befitting response. The Indian effort to infiltrate our border and seize Tibet resulted in them overstretching their capabilities. Our battle hardened and patriotic forces utilized the lessons we have learned in mountain warfare to overwhelm and destroy the Indian forces in the disputed territory. The professional soldiers of the Indian Army proved they are simple puppets devoted to money, not patriotism and were easily defeated by our forces. Upon securing the disputed territory, we announced a unilateral ceasefire, our forces can secure the territory and we have announced to the world how we have humiliated our enemy. More importantly, enemy propaganda that we are planning a general invasion has proven false. However, considering how successful we have been, we must consider whether we want to continue the fighting into India proper to secure a major revolutionary victory. Or should we stick to our ceasefire and just complete our annexation of Aksai Chin."
 SINO_INDIA.11.d:0 "After heavy fighting with India along our Himalayan border, news has reached us that People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces have been driven out of the disputed territories. The conniving Indian forces had established fortified positions earlier behind our lines in the leadup to the fighting. From these positions the enemy successfully interdicted supply lines and ambushed troops moving through our own territory. Emboldened with their treacherous success, Indian forces surged in support to finish driving us out of the disputed lands. The Indian government announced their forces success in occupying the lands they claimed. The PLA has been humiliated and some commanders are already suggesting the peasant soldier model may not be viable now that China has vast borders to protect. Perhaps more professionalism, along the lines of the Indian Army maybe needed to ensure in future conflicts our forces will be capable of responding to border incidents like this. We will have to sit with the Indian government and listen to their demands for the border, hopefully Tibet will not be compromised by these events."
 SINO_INDIA.12.d:0 "The Chinese aggression began with its seizure of Tibet. The cunning Chinese talked of peace but were acting to seize our lands. From the Himalayas, China would have been poised to plunder our lands but our forces have prevailed. Today, we received a note from the Chinese government asking for a ceasefire to stop the battering of its forces and also asked for immediate discussions on the border. General B.M. Kaul's direction for the Army to engage in a Forward Policy to interdict Chinese infiltrators ended up being a sound strategy. Our professional troops and officers conducted their objectives to perfection. Chinese infiltration efforts were cut off by our forward posts. The Army's assessment that Chinese troops were just armed peasants who could not handle professional soldiers has proven correct. With this victory, we can now dictate the border to its proper dimensions. The Chinese can no longer ignore the treaties or demarcations of the past and more importantly they will have to return the Kashmir lands illegally claimed by them. In New Delhi, jubilant crowds took to the streets chanting ‘Jai Hind!' and showering anyone in a military uniform with flowers. Military bases across the nation have received deliveries of sweets from grateful citizens as independent India has demonstrated its status as a major power."
 SINO_INDIA.13.d:0 "The Indian government received a note from the Chinese government that it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in Aksai Chin and the North-East Frontier Agency. Chinese forces secured almost all the disputed territory and Indian resistance had almost completely crumbled in the disputed zone. Our Army's decision to launch a Forward Policy of aggressive patrolling and establishing posts behind Chinese troop positions proved to be poorly conceived. Chinese infiltration tactics successfully isolated and overrun many of these posts. More importantly, Indian troops marched to the Himalayan combat zone in summer uniforms and lacked intelligence. One junior officer bitterly complained his unit had to use local tourist maps as their own maps on the territory was almost worthless. Across India, fears of further Chinese aggression are palpable, while the Indian Army itself must consider some soul searching. Despite this, patriotism remains high. Logistics and specialized training for troops must be a priority and many officers argue the military must evolve its doctrines beyond the World War II experience. Although the Chinese have stopped and achieved their objectives, many in India are holding their breath as they fear further Chinese aggression to take advantage of India's military setbacks. At the very least, we are at the mercy of Chinese wishes in the disputed lands."

 PRC_Dispute.4.d:0 "\n\nThe woes for the Indian military and government continued as the People's Liberation Army announced it was launching an invasion of India. The PLA says its objective is to liberate the people of India from colonial oppression This marks a dramatic change as the PLA initially portrayed the conflict as a border dispute and Indians now fear waves of Chinese divisions will soon pour out of the Himalayas into the Indian plains. The Indian Army had earlier attempted to dislodge the PLA and secure their claims along its disputed border with China through a policy of establishing small outposts in the disputed lands. In New Delhi an atmosphere of fear is palpable as the government now has ordered the military to redeploy its entire force to face the Chinese threat. However, in other major cities, many Indians have taken to the street to demonstrate their support for the military, many young men have pledged to resist the Chinese." 
 
 #Cyprus Events
 Turkish_Intervention_Unlocked:0 "The EOKA has won against Britain and has yet to have joined Greece"
 
 GRE_EOKA_TT:0 "Enable Greek EOKA Decisions"
 
 Zurich_1_d:0 "Following the Zurich Agreement, the governments of Britain, Greece, and Turkey created the framework for what an independent Greece must look like. As the proposed constitutional framework was for an independent Cyprus with guarantees that it, Greece, and Turkey would refrain from unification, the agreement was a rejection of enosis (unification of Cyprus to Greece). It was decided to present the framework for finalizing and approval by the Cypriote Greek and Turkish communities in a London summit. Many Cypriote Greeks, especially those engaged in resistance to the colonial regime outright denounced the agreement for the rejection of enosis. However, the governments of Greece and Great Britain managed to convince the most popular Cypriote Greek leader and ardent enosis propagator Archbishop Markarios to attend and represent his community in London. Many believe he was convinced to participate in order to help find a solution to end the violence on Cyprus. For the Cypriote Turkish community, Dr. Fazil Kutchuck came as the main representative. Britain, Turkey, and Greece again sent representatives to oversee the process. As the summit begins, there is optimism that Cyprus may finally return to peace."
 Zurich_2_d:0 "After a tense negotiation, the London summit on Cyprus has announced an agreement has been made and will be signed shortly by the representatives attending. The Cypriote Turkish community was anxious to ensure its rights were protected and enosis would be off the table. The Cypriote Greeks were looking for a way to end the armed conflict and since enosis was no longer viable, they sought guarantees to their political rights. Apparently, the final agreement will assuage both community's misgivings and more importantly for the people of Cyprus, finally lead a way for the end of armed conflict. For the British, securing a final agreement will give it an exit from governing the island although it is expected the British will retain control of certain military bases. Strategically, the RAF airfield in Cyprus is of immense strategic value for the British. The final signing and more details about the agreement is expected soon."
 Zurich_3_d:0 "With representatives of Great Britain, Greece, and Turkey looking on, the leaders of the Cypriote Greek and Cypriote Turkish communities signed the London Agreement. Armed conflict on Cyprus is expected to be ending almost immediately and the people of Cyprus are expected to begin the process of preparing for independence almost immediately. The agreement in London formalized the constitutional framework agreed to in Zurich and added Treaty of Guarantee and Treaty of Alliance. The Treaty of Guarantee pledges Cyprus shall neither demand enosis nor partition and will remain an independent republic with guaranteed rights and political representation for both communities. The Treaty of Alliance limited the number of military personnel from Greece and Turkey and pledged they would work together to preserve the agreement, though if any party violated the agreement, each party reserved the right to act unilaterally to preserve it. The complicated constitution appears to be rigid as any attempts to radically change it appears forbidden. Many in Cyprus hope with the end of colonial rule peace can return, but there are observers who point out the lack of goodwill between the Cypriote communities may make the new constitution untenable. Time will tell whether these fears are warranted or if Cyprus will emerge as a prosperous republic."
 Zurich_4_d:0 "In Zurich, detailed discussions between senior representatives of Great Britain, Turkey, and Greece concluded in an agreement about how to resolve the crisis in Cyprus. All three states agreed that Cyprus must become an independent state and finalized the framework on which the constitution will be made. The complicated agreement wants to see a constitution which follows the framework agreed by the three powers. Cyprus will make Greek and Turkish the national languages of a new state and divide political power between the two communities. The president will be Greek and Vice President Turkish, with the Vice President holding a veto power. This is to prevent the Greek majority legislature from renegading the agreement or pass laws restricting the Turkish community's rights. Essentially the three nations agreed not to seize Cyprus for themselves and promised to establish a republic which caters to the interests of both communities on the island. After this agreement it is expected representatives of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus will travel to London in order to finalize a constitution and accept an end to the crisis in Cyprus. Although many Cypriots cautiously welcome the agreement, there is still a great deal of distrust between the communities and already some Greek nationalists are condemning what they see is an imposed agreement by outside powers."
 Zurich_5_d:0 "In a stunning reversal to the governments of Britain, Greece, and Turkey, the London Summit has ended without an agreement. The Cypriote Greeks, led by Archbishop Markarios declared they could not in good conscious accept such a restrictive constitutional framework or completely reject enosis, as it remains a desire deep in the hearts of Cypriote Greeks. The British in particular are said to be fuming as this diplomatic debacle is being portrayed as an example to the whole British policy in Cyprus being disastrous. The British had invited Archbishop Markarios to attend and although he initially declined he had been convinced to attend. The British were under the impression the Archbishop would not demand enosis and was willing to accept independence for Cyprus. Archbishop Markarios was said to be motivated by a desire to see the end of armed conflict on the island even if it meant an end to the enosis demand. However, it appears upon closer examination of the constitutional framework and his interactions with the representatives of the Cypriote Turkish community, he decided the proposed agreement was unfeasible and left the conference."

 EOKA_GRE_1:0 "Many people are increasingly sympathetic to the goal of achieving Enosis with the Greek nation. Our guerilla bands operate freely from their mountainous hideouts and work with town groups who engage in urban actions such as encouraging riots and strikes. The National Front supports these armed efforts by facilitating the acquisition of supplies, arms, and most importantly, intelligence to the armed wings of the movement. Recently, several National Front operatives were able to join local police units and take on positions in government buildings. We expect they will be able to provide invaluable information on British troop movements and aid our fighters to strike at the weakest targets. More importantly, we hope to uncover information about local collaborators or traitors to the cause."
 EOKA_GRE_2:0 "Our guerilla bands operate freely from their mountainous hideouts and work with town groups who engage in urban actions such as encouraging riots and strikes. The National Front supports these armed efforts by facilitating the acquisition of supplies, arms, and most importantly, intelligence to the armed wings of the movement. However, a recent effort by the National Front to embed operatives within the local police and government in one area resulted in disaster. Apparently, the operatives were discovered and were fed false information leading to the mauling of one mountain band of fighters. The operatives were detained almost immediately after it became clear they were being tricked by the British."
 EOKA_GRE_3:0 "One of our mountain guerrilla warfare bands took advantage of an area with a light British presence. Operating from their mountain base they quickly moved into a major village and raided the local police station and attacked a small, lightly armed British patrol. The British were quickly forced to withdraw in defeat while our fighters were able to seize the police station, acquire weapons and ammunition. The local townspeople were said to be cheering our men and some are said to have joined either the local urban town group or gone to the mountains themselves."
 EOKA_GRE_4:0 "In a reversal today, one of our mountain guerilla warfare bands made a major tactical blunder in an operation to raid a nearby town to acquire arms and supplies from a nearby town. Our fighters had assumed the local police would be loyal to our fighters and there was no British presence nearby. Both counts proved false as they faced stiff resistance from the police, which apparently consisted of Turkish Cypriot policemen brought in and this force was bolstered by British troops in the area. The attempted raid failed to secure any of its objectives or even reach the police station and our fighters were forced to withdraw with casualties. The local population is said to be greatly discouraged by this failure."
 EOKA_GRE_5:0 "The best way to show the British continued colonial rule must be ended is to make the cost of continuous occupation too high. We must especially demonstrate tis to the British public and that is why sabotage operations and bombings are so effective. Our town groups conduct these operations and over the past week have successfully bombed a local police station, British military base, and several homes of anti-EOKA officials. These high-profile attacks, although not inflicting high casualties, did achieve their objective of demonstrating to the international community that the situation in Cyprus is unstable. The British forces are under scrutiny and are facing increasing questions from the press about whether any progress has been made in their fight against the EOKA."
 EOKA_GRE_6:0 "The best way to show the British continued colonial rule must be ended is to make the cost of continuous occupation too high. We must especially demonstrate tis to the British public and that is why sabotage operations and bombings are so effective. Our town groups conduct these operations but unfortunately one group failed to bomb a military outpost and several homes of British colonial officials. Apparently, the British saw some men conducting surveillance on target sites and decided to track them instead of detaining them. When our fighters moved to plant their devices at the different locations, they were either detained or ambushed by waiting British forces. The British have uprooted a town group and are parading the captured explosives to the press to demonize our cause."

 EOKA_1_d:0 "Although it is difficult to admit, the EOKA has managed to garner a lot of sympathy and support from the Greek community on Cyprus. Opponents are generally silenced through intimidation, bombing, or violence. However, our recent efforts to expand intelligence collection by using local anti-EOKA groups or small units of intelligence operatives has yielded a major success yesterday. A mid-level EOKA commander has been successfully turned by one of our agents and is feeding us detailed information regarding EOKA tactics, objectives, and movements in the area. From this intelligence we expect to launch several successful operations and hope the this will break the EOKA popularity in the area."
 EOKA_2_d:0 "Although it is difficult to admit, the EOKA has managed to garner a lot of sympathy and support from the Greek community on Cyprus. Opponents are generally silenced through intimidation, bombing, or violence. Recently an intelligence source informed us he had a senior EOKA logistics leader willing to turn and provide information for cash regarding the movement of arms and weapons. Our overzealous local officer pushed the intelligence source to get actionable intelligence which was then immediately used in a successful operation. However, the EOKA quickly realized what had happened and when our vital intelligence source went to meet the source, they both disappeared. We expect to find their bodies in the next few days and our intelligence in the area is greatly hindered."
 EOKA_3_d:0 "Our search and cordon operations to uproot the EOKA have generally failed as the enemy often gets advanced warning from sympathizers. It was decided to conduct operations more frequently and replace the police with more Turkish Cypriote residents to plug leaks to enemy fighters. These policy changes bore fruit today as our forces successfully found and assaulted one of the enemy's mountain camps. The enemy fighters were unprepared, those who were not casualties or captured fled deeper into the mountains and our forces took no casualties. The operation saw us collect valuable intelligence and remove a cache of arms from the enemy."
 EOKA_4_d:0 "A major search and cordon operation, which the colonel in command had promised to the press would result in massive losses for the enemy ended in failure today. Our forces searched the whole sector, detained dozens of local men, searched many homes, and found nothing. Publicly our leadership was embarrassed. More significantly, the disruption of the operation on the local population's day to day life and the rough handed manner in which detainees were questioned meant many locals are increasingly sympathetic to the EOKA. More operations like this will only serve to bolster the enemy's influence among the population."
 EOKA_5_d:0 "Our search and cordon operations to uproot the EOKA have generally failed as the enemy often gets advanced warning from sympathizers.

The operation saw us collect valuable intelligence and remove a cache of arms from the enemy."
 EOKA_6_d:0 "The Royal Airforce (RAF) maintains a large and strategically vital airfield along with other assets on Cyprus. When the RAF is not caught up with operations essential to British objectives in the region, they aid the local forces. However, in an unfortunate incident, the RAF ended up bombing what was thought to be an EOKA safehouse located outside a village. However, the building was in fact a storehouse for locals to hold their crops before selling to the market. The bombing of this structure has alienated the local population who believe the British are willing to gamble innocent lives on flimsy intelligence. EOKA support is expected to be boosted in the coming days."
 
 EOKA_7_d:0 "The British government has announced its withdrawal from Cyprus. The British cite the refusal of the Cypriote Greek population to be governed and the unsustainable costs required to maintain a British presence. For the EOKA this is a major victory as its mountain guerrilla fighters successfully achieved their first objective of ending colonial rule. Now with the British withdrawal, the group will push for enosis with Greece. Throughout the conflict the group not only effectively dealt with the British but also made it a point to silence opposition and portray the conflict as an intercommunal one between the Cypriote Greek and Cypriote Turkish communities. This has allowed the group to even convince moderate Cypriote Greeks that to survive and prevent a Cypriote Turkish coup or even a Turkish invasion, enosis must be achieved as quickly as possible. The British are expected to withdraw quite hastily as the EOKA fighters move in to secure strategic positions across the island."
 EOKA_8_d:0 "The British military command in Cyprus accepted the surrender of the final bands of EOKA fighters today. The EOKA had emerged as a potentially potent guerrilla force. The Greek Orthodox Church and the group's logistical arm facilitated the movement of arms, supplies, intelligence, and men for the group. Among the Cypriote Greek population, they initially enjoyed a lot of support and sympathy for their call for enosis. However, the British military proved very effective in its counter-insurgency tactics. It managed to gain intelligence on fighters and utilized the minority Cypriote Turkish community to act as auxiliary forces and police. This greatly reduced leaks and allowed the British to avoid tipping their hand. The EOKA's failures against the British along with attempts to target the Cypriote Turkish community to provoke a conflict ended up weakening public support, by the end many Cypriote Greeks saw them as more of a nuisance who stood in the way of a political solution."

 Enosis_d:0 "In Athens tonight, the Greek government released a statement congratulating the people of Greece and Cyprus for achieving enosis today. Earlier in the day huge celebrations with patriotic songs and speeches occurred in major towns across Greece and Cyprus. In Athens, the senior political and military leadership listened to speeches with leading Cypriote Greek leaders siting amongst them to indicate the new unity. Enosis had been talked about extensively since the early nineteenth century and its success has renewed the patriotic fervor of Greeks. Greek Orthodox churches across the world held special services to celebrate the achievement. Efforts to invite representatives of the Cypriote Turkish community to the festivities were rebuffed. Many in the Cypriote Turkish community to remain upset with enosis as they fear their rights and homes will soon be targeted by Cypriote Greeks. Rumors have grown among the Cypriote Turks that Greece plans on expelling them and seizing their lands to give to Greek immigrants from the mainland. If enosis is to thrive, Greece must work to not just integrate the island to the mainland but also assuage the fears of its sizeable Cypriote Turkish minority, who may seek the help of Turkey or launch its own resistance if it feels overly threatened. Regardless of the future, the people of Greece tonight will sleep with an optimism towards the future."

 TMT_1_d:0 "As the TMT, we oppose Enosis and the EOKA's brutal actions against our community in Cyprus. Indeed, the increasing violence has pushed the British to rely on recruiting Turkish Cypriotes for the police. To take advantage of this trend we have sent members to join the police in a strategic area and are gaining valuable intelligence. These members have brought other Turkish officers to the cause. In addition, their intelligence will provide us cover from the scrutiny of the colonial government and feed us intelligence so we know pro-EOKA figures we can target in the area."
 TMT_2_d:0 "A recent effort by our supporters to join the local police ended in disaster. Increasingly the British have begun recruiting Turkish Cypriotes to join the police and prevent the EOKA from infiltrating the police. However, our recent effort at infiltrating a local police force failed. Our men approached several officers they thought would be sympathetic to the TMT cause but misjudged, the men instead reported them to the British. The British detained our supporters and after an interrogation uprooted a lot of our sympathizers in the area, greatly hindering our intelligence and weakening morale."
 TMT_3_d:0 "Using intelligence gained from sympathetic Turkish police officers, we discovered the location of an EOKA safe house. One team of fighters led the assault on the safehouse, and we successfully destroyed the EOKA infestation. The operation was done during the day to show in this area we will not tolerate the EOKA and combat their narrative that the conflict in Cyprus is one about Greece unification. The Turkish press has covered the incident extensively, hopefully this will help raise our profile and garner us more sympathy."
 TMT_4_d:0 "Using intelligence gained from sympathetic Turkish police officers, we discovered the location of an EOKA safe house. We assembled a team of fighters to destroy the EOKA forces at the location. However, disaster struck as it appears the EOKA had fed this intelligence to lure us for a trap. Our fighters suffered casualties and after a protracted firefight were forced to retreat. The failed operation has lowered our reputation among the Turkish community and our patrons in Turkey have grown concerned about the failure. More importantly, the EOKA has used the incident to push its narrative of us as being traitors to Cyprus."
 TMT_5_d:0 "The EOKA has long sought to provoke armed conflict between the Cypriote Greek and Cypriote Turkish communities. By escalating ethnic tensions and pushing the conflict to one between communities, they feel more Greeks will join their cause. To counter these efforts, we have successfully bombed the homes of several major EOKA sympathizers in the area. These men had been making statements against our and rallying their community in opposition to us. We believe the will remain silent now and we successfully showed our people will not be easily intimidated."
 TMT_6_d:0 "The EOKA has long sought to provoke armed conflict between the Cypriote Greek and Cypriote Turkish communities. By escalating ethnic tensions and pushing the conflict to one between communities, they feel more Greeks will join their cause. To counter these efforts, we tried to bomb the homes of several major EOKA sympathizers in the area to silence their criticism of us and our community. However, the operation was compromised, and our fighters were caught red handed by local authorities. The EOKA has already spread word of the attempt and retaliatory actions are already occurring. Many local Turks in the area now blame us for provoking such violence and our support has weakened."
           
 TMT_7_d:0 "The TMT had formed to counter the growing harassment and violence perpetrated by the EOKA against the Cypriote Turkish community and combat the cause of enosis. The group took advantage of training, volunteers, and supplies from Turkey. In addition, the British policy of recruiting Cypriote Turks to fill the police ranks allowed us to place operatives and collect intelligence on the EOKA. After a successful campaign in Northern Cyprus in which we targeted EOKA and prominent Cypriote Greek leaders, we successfully carved out the northern half of the island for our people. Once Cypriote Greek communities realized our forces were in charge, they moved south and away, leaving their homes for our people. With North Cyprus essentially a Turkish enclave we can negotiate from a position of strength and push for partition, enosis is no longer a viable option in Cyprus."
 TMT_8_d:0 "\nThe TMT formally dissolved itself today. It had formed as a counter to the EOKA and its harassment and violence against the Cypriote Turkish community. The goal of the TMT was to prevent enosis and secure a generous partition of Cyprus on ethnic lines. Although the TMT enjoyed tacit support from British and covert Turkish aid, it could not utilize these advantages to tactical victories. Efforts to defeat the EOKA and secure Northern Cyprus failed and with each defeat support diminished. As the defeats increased, the EOKA moved in and successfully displaced some Cypriote Turkish communities, strengthening their claims for enosis and dispersing the Turkish minority to prevent them from creating a block. The defeat of the TMT now leaves the Cypriote Turkish minority vulnerable and unprotected from the Cypriote Greeks. Now we are dependent on the goodwill of the Cypriote Greeks and our international patron, Turkey."

 Cyprus_TUR_1_d:0 "The situation in Cyprus continues to deteriorate as the Greek Cypriotes continue to advocate the removal of rights from the Turkish Cypriote community. Since the London Agreement, the Republic of Cyprus has faced political deadlock. Many Greek Cypriotes viewed the guaranteed representation and minority rights for the Turkish Cypriotes as excessive and not reflective of the demographic reality in Cyprus. In addition, they resent the veto powers of the Turkish Cypriote Vice President. Recent attempts to force constitutional changes and end what they see as excessive rights were vetoed, leading to increased tension and violence across the island. Our Turkish Cypriote brothers and sisters have increasingly become targets of riots and violence. Our intelligence believes the Greek Cypriotes are seeking to use violence and force the minority Turkish Cypriotes into obedience and then take the island to enosis as once the constitutional amendments pass, we believe they will request enosis. According to the Treaty of Guarantee signed during the London Agreement, we, along with Greece and Britain are pledged to maintain the provisions, but so far Greece and Britain appear unwilling to intervene. However, the treaty did not specify we had to act in concert with the other signatories. As a result, we have two options for Cyprus. One is to intervene, we already have a military force on the island and our commanders say they can easily establish a Turkish safe zone in the north of the island to prevent further violence. However, although we have the right by treaty, we expect some international backlash and the risk of a wider conflict with Greece. The other option would be to not intervene but diplomatically ensure the Turkish Cypriotes voice and rights are listened to."
 Cyprus_TUR_2_d:0 "In northern Cyprus, it is reported that a large number of military personnel from Turkey have established a beachhead. The Republic of Cyprus dispatched a military force to resist the invaders and ended up facing a heavily armed Turkish force supported by heavy air power. Reports have also reached of Turkish paratroopers landing at strategic points on the island. The government of Greece and Cyprus immediately condemned this naked act of aggression while the government of Turkey announced it was acting in accordance to the Treaty of Guarantee signed at the London Agreement which ended British colonial rule over Cyprus. Turkey argues recent efforts by the Greek Cypriote majority to change the constitution, remove guaranteed rights for the Turkish Cypriote minority, and the increased incidents of ethnic violence necessitated their intervention. They say the efforts to terrorize Turkish Cypriotes into agreeing with the changes was designed to lead to their eventual expulsion from the island and Cyprus proclaiming enosis with Greece, in clear violation to both the Zurich and London Agreements. Greece and Cyprus both pointed out the Turkish invasion appears to be aimed at securing the Turkish Cypriote main enclaves and not in restoring the original constitution. It is unknown if Greece will dispatch additional forces to the island. The Turkish government however, insists if it did not intervene, ethnic warfare and forced deportation was going to happen. The fighting appears intense and at the moment Turkish forces seem to have not broken out of the beachhead. The United States and Britain are both said to be caught off-guard by the Turkish action and early word from Washington indicates they might be very displeased by Turkey's aggressive actions. We are still waiting for their formal response."
 
 cyprus_decisions:0 "The Cyprus Emergency"
 cyprus_decisions_desc:0 "Enosis, the unification of Cyprus to Greece, has long been propagated by the government of Greece and the Greek Orthodox Church. The church especially spread this idea to the Cypriote Greek population since the early twentieth century. A number of pro-enosis Cypriotes are now organizing into armed bands as the only way for achieve enosis appears to now be armed conflict. Calling themselves the EOKA, these Cypriote Greeks will take on the British colonial regime, internal opponents, force Britain to concede enosis to the people. However, for the island's sizable minority of Cypriote Turks, enosis represents their destruction as they are well-aware of the post-Ottoman deportations and persecution of Muslims. Leading Cypriote Turks formed the armed TMT to counter the EOKA, stop enosis, preserve their rights and if that is not possible to achieve a partition of the island on ethnic lines. Decolonization and other pressures have reduced British assets globally, making Cyprus even more significant to retain. The EOKA actions will likely provoke a strong British response to preserve Cyprus as a crown colony.\n\n EOKA Strength: [?ENG.eoka_insurgency]\nTurkish Resistance Organisation Strength: [?ENG.tmt_insurgency]"
 
 CYP_INSURGENCY.1.d:0 "After several years of planning and a failure to push the British to grant Greeks on Cyprus the option to vote for enosis, a new Greek nationalist guerilla movement has emerged. Calling itself the EOKA, the group last night announced a major escalation in Cyprus by launching a coordinated nighttime assault across Cyprus. The attack targeted the radio station, British military bases, a power station, police stations, and the homes of senior colonial officials. The attacks were followed by a statement widely released by the EOKA which announced its presence to the people of Cyprus. The leader who released the proclamation called himself Digenes, after a Byzantine general that defended Cyprus centuries ago. The EOKA actions are being seen positively by many Greek Cypriotes who have long believed enosis must be achieved by any means necessary. For the British, the attacks demonstrate their efforts to keep order and peace in Cyprus has failed but military commanders are confident any anti-colonial movement on the island will be easily dealt with. More British troops are expected to be dispatched to Cyprus in the coming days."
 CYP_INSURGENCY.2.d:0 "Since the early nineteenth century, many Greeks, were strong believers in unifying all lands with Greek populations to Greece. Since then the, small initial Greek state has expanded and united many Greek territories back with the mainland. However, one of the driving desires for Greece and its people is the unification of Greece with Cyprus. This dream unification is called enosis. Since the early and mid-twentieth century, enosis has been widely propagated not just in Greece but in British controlled Cyprus, specifically by the Greek Orthodox church. With Cypriote Greeks increasingly interested in challenging British rule, Greeks from across the world now send funds in support of enosis. Greek communities from Greece and Egypt are especially dedicated but the church is also collecting funds from Greek churches across the world. From these funds, the Greek Orthodox church is able to press the enosis cause in Cyprus and provide funds for those Cypriote Greeks willing to escalate the struggle if the British remain unwilling to budge. The Greek government is said to be facilitating the church's funding operations and is providing officers to help the Cypriote Greeks organize their resistance."
 UN_Cyprus.1.d:0 "The Greek government today formally asked the United Nations to intervene and allow the people of Cyprus to have a plebiscite on whether they want enosis or not . The Greek representatives pointed out the Greeks who reside on the island have done so for many centuries and they have long, deep historical, cultural, and religious affiliation with mainland Greece. They argued Cyprus is an extended limb of the Greek nation that has been shamefully separated by outside powers for many years. They urged the United Nations to strongly consider the aspirations of the Cypriote people and wrong an historical mistake. Ultimately, the government of Greece asked the United Nations to implement the right of self-determination and equal rights for the people of Cyprus and hold a referendum on its future. The impassioned presentation, done with representatives of the Cypriote Greek community, was countered by the Turkish government who pointed out Cyprus's long history with Anatolia and cautioned giving the island to Greece will leave the sizable Turkish minority vulnerable to violence and expulsion. The Turkish delegation had representatives of the Cypriote Turkish community present to support their stance. The United Nations will consider the government of Greece's request but many expect the status quo to remain, though nothing is ever certain."
 UN_Cyprus.2.d:0 "In a major surprise to the international community, the United Nations agreed to a plebiscite on Cyprus to consider whether the nation wishes for unification with Greece or not. Considering the Cypriote Greek community's majority on the island, many expect the results will be a clear victory for enosis and it appears the unification of Cyprus to Greece is inevitable. News of the decision has seen thousands take to the streets of Athens and across Cyprus in joy. The festive atmosphere was only contrasted by reporters who visited the Cypriote Turkish neighborhoods and towns. In those areas the mood was quite somber with many residents expressing their disappointment with the United Nations and fears of the future. When Cyprus joins Greece it will take a lot of effort and goodwill to assuage the fears of the Cypriote Turkish community. Upon hearing the United Nations decision, the Turkish representatives stormed out of the chamber. Afterwards they released a statement condemning the decision and claiming it will never abandon its duty to ensure the protection of the Cypriote Turkish community. The government of Greece welcomed the announcement, simply saying the vote will show allow the people of Cyprus to determine their own destiny."
 UN_Cyprus.3.d:0 "The United Nations today announced it would not take up Greece's proposal for a plebiscite on Cyprus to allow its people the right of self-determination. The failure was largely due to several factors, some nations were concerned about what such a vote would mean for Cyprus's Turkish minority and if this would just lead to another round of conflict. Another group of nations feared the precedent set if they were to allow the vote to go through. Finally, a number of nations did not want to risk their close ties with Turkey or drastically change the status quo in the region. The mood within the Cypriote Greek community is disappointment and in some towns protesters, including stone throwing youths attacked colonial police in frustration to the announcement. All sides involved in the increasing tensions on Cyprus must work on other avenues to resolve the conflict, although reports from Athens indicate it may approach the United Nations on a later date to try again."

 indonesia.1.d:0 "Our delegation has recently returned from the Indonesia Round Table held at the Hague. They have with them an agreement which offers Indonesia its independence from the Netherlands. Although the Dutch have had some successes on the battlefield, the conflict is far too expensive for them and the international pressure has hardened against their actions. Our own people have been fighting for years, first against the brutal Japanese occupation and now the Dutch, the sacrifices have been immense, and peace is now at hand. The discussions were very fruitful, but the delegation explained two issues emerged. One was the Dutch East India's national debt. We were not willing to take on the recent debt incurred as this would mean we are paying the Dutch for the war they waged on us, but the delegation assured us for just taking on a portion of the debt we can achieve freedom. The other issue is West Papua, from initially refusing to even discuss the topic, they eventually agreed to hold talks on its future within a year of our independence. The Netherlands parliament has already approved the agreement and once our legislature agrees we can finally move on to a new era of freedom for the people of Indonesia."
 indonesia.2.d:0 "The Indonesia Round Table Conference ended this week in the Netherlands. Indonesia will finally be handed sovereignty by the Dutch and achieve independence. This agreement marks the end of a violent colonial war which saw the Dutch attempting to re-establish colonial rule over its former colonies after being driven out by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. A loose band of Indonesian resistance fighters, many secular supporters of a republic, fought together against the Dutch who faced increased international criticism for its efforts to reimpose colonial rule. The Indonesian Round Table came about after several other major conferences and at a time where the Dutch face even heavier international pressure, while the Indonesian fighters struggle to deal with a population increasingly war-weary. Although the conference ended in success, there were two major stumbling blocks, the Dutch East India debt and West Papua. With encouragement from the United States, the Indonesians agreed to take on some of the debt and the Netherlands agreed to a rapid military withdrawal. In regard to West Papua, the Netherlands initially refused to discuss it but eventually agreed to hold talks on its future within a year of Indonesia's independence. The Dutch parliament has approved the agreement and it is expected the Indonesian representatives will likewise get approval once they present the treaty to the acting Indonesian legislature. Indonesia's leader Sukarno was said to be elated by the prospect of seeing his country achieve freedom and an end to almost a decade of military conflict on the islands."

 Northwood.1.d:0 "The President received a proposal from the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other government agencies about Operation Northwoods. The plan calls for American intelligence agencies to orchestrate a series of terrorist attacks, including bombings against American military assets, the assassination of leading anti-communist Cubans, and the sinking of Cuban refugee boats to blame on the Cuban government. Once the American people and global community were sufficiently outraged, then the United States could end the communist regime in Cuba with a direct military invasion. The military has signed off on the plan but the final decision rests with the President. Implementing the operation may help the United States resolve the problem of Cuba but to do so by targeting innocent civilians and American military personnel is morally questionable. In addition, if news came out the government was a party to such a false flag operation, the public backlash may lead to a major political crisis."
 Northwood.usa2.d:0 "A series of false flag attacks meant to paint Cuba as a terrorist threat, have begun. Guantanamo Bay continuously reports explosions and mortar attacks, with visiting media shown damage caused by “Cuban” fire. The Navy and Coast Guard both report picking up survivors from ships of Cuban refugees whose vessels were destroyed at sea. In the Miami area, prominent anti-communist Cuban activists and former members of the Batista regime have been assassinated. Newspapers across the country are filled with editorials demanding the United States respond to the naked aggression exhibited by the Cuban government. A Cuban official stunned everyone by denying any involvement of the Cuban government and blaming the United States for being behind these recent attacks. The claims have been largely ridiculed by the media and so far, the American government can be confident Operation Northwoods has been tremendously successful in rallying the American people to confront the Cuban menace."

 PRO_UAR_COUP.2.d:0 "Although Arab nationalism as an idea emerged following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, it would be President Nasser of Egypt who brought the ideology to the mainstream. Following the Egyptian Revolution, President Nasser engaged in a massive propaganda effort to spread his revolutionary message across the region. Last night, in [global.UAR_TARGET.GetName], these efforts bore fruit. During the night, military forces left their barracks and quickly seized key media, communication, and government buildings across the capital. By morning, the coup leaders announced they had seized power and had the old regime under their control. It is unknown to what extent there was violence involved though there were reports of sporadic firing during the night. The military junta which launched the coup announced themselves as the Free Officers of [global.UAR_TARGET.GetName] and pledged to initiate Arab socialist reforms along the lines of Nasser.

 US_Mars.1.d:0 "In a nationally televised address from NASA headquarters, President Agnew declared the United States would land a man on Mars. The President noted that Americans are historically a people who always strive for the furthest frontiers. Mars will be the next great frontier. He added that America will need its brightest people working with brave men to achieve this undertaking. He noted the technology exists for a Mars mission, but it will be NASA who must successfully utilize the technology for the mission. The response to the speech was strongly felt by younger Americans, excited for a noble mission. However, some in the media continue to point out such expensive space missions will drain government resources from more pressing issues."
 US_Mars.2.d:0 "President Agnew's request to congress regarding a major expansion of funds for NASA was recently approved. This is considered a huge victory for the President. During the previous administration, President Agnew had chaired the Space Task Group to consider the next phase of American space exploration and development. Now that he occupies the Oval Office, he can begin to implement those recommendations. The first step of drastically increasing the NASA budget has been achieved. Although the President is quite dedicated to his space ambitions, there are many in Congress and across the country who question whether the United States should engage in expensive space projects with so many other issues facing the nation"
 US_Mars.3.d:0 "Millions of Americans were glued to television sets across the nation as audio transmitted from Mars indicating a successful landing on Mars. The dangerous mission had only been possible by the efforts of President Agnew to ensure the American space program remained a priority for the United States. After the transmission, the President addressed the nation, heaping praise on the astronauts and NASA for achieving the goal of a Mars landing. He also noted with this success, America has established itself as the clear premier space power on the planet. Members of the media who had constantly ridiculed the space mission for being too expensive were notably congratulatory to the achievement of NASA and the President."
 US_Mars.4.d:0 "When NASA proposed its Integrated Program Plan (IPP), many in Washington expected the President to reject it as unfeasible considering its expenses. However, President Agnew was convinced and pledged full support for the ambitious NASA plans. The Integrated Program Plan hopes to establish space stations, bases on the Moon and Mars eventually. It also calls for the building of specialized satellites and a new reusable space shuttle that will aid in building the vast space infrastructure involved in the plan. NASA and the scientific community reacted very favorably to the news, many seeing it as the foundation for a new technological revolution. However, members of Congress and the media are already referring to the IPP as a financial folly."

 #Qatar Events
 Qatar_Pol.1.d:0 "Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani announced his abdication as the ruling Amir of Qatar. This comes months after his cousin attempted to assassinate him in Beirut. He came to power in 1949 and during his rule Qatar entered the oil industry and greatly expanded education facilities for its people. He also patronized Islamic literature, facilitating the publication of many works on Islam that had previously only had available to a select few. Recent years has seen his government challenged by the rising popularity of Arab Nationalism and increasing unrest among oil workers. Although he sought to mediate these issues, these tensions remain. He has selected his son Ahmed bin Ali Al Thani to take over and there is hope among many Qatari that the new, more youthful Amir will help continue the modernization of the nation."
 Qatar_Pol.4.d:0 "The new Amir of Qatar has indicated a desire to oversee reform and development in his nation. There is a recognition within the royal family and its supporters that to remain in power and satisfy the desires of its people it must change and reform. The Amir fears the current of new ideas sweeping the world and region may overwhelm the government if it is not prepared. To achieve this, the Amir requested the British government to provide a Political Advisor to help him as he begins his reign. The Political Advisor will offer support, facilitate aid to the nation and help direct the reform program effectively. This will also strengthen ties between Qatar and its patron, Britain."
 Qatar_Pol.2.d:0 "The influence of Arab Nationalism across the Arab World has infected the hearts of many in Qatar. They now believe strongly in pan-Arab ideas which undermine the government of Qatar and the royal family. The Amir in particular is aware of this threat and fears his decision to send Qataris abroad for education has resulted in many returning with this dangerous ideology. The British are also concerned as the strong anti-colonial underpinnings of the ideology threaten their relationship and presence in Qatar. Many in the government are advocating a strong approach to shutting down the threat. However, there is also a faction that argues an aggressive approach may radicalize the Arab nationalists and that accommodating them maybe the best approach."
 QAT_Suez_Crisis.1.d:0 "The recent Suez Crisis is enflaming passions among the people of Qatar. Many in the country view the British collaboration with Israel against the Arab people of Egypt as an imperialist plot to weaken the Arab World and enslave it to the West. Oil workers are particularly upset and have spearheaded street protests against the British. Considering the close relationship between the government and the British, there are increasing fears that these protests may escalate and challenge the government. However, the government must treat carefully as it does not want to be seen as being against the aspirations of Arabs or as a tool for the British."
 Qatar_Pol.3.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar called on the British military to intervene and restore order to the country. The unrest caused by the Suez Crisis has turned into protests against the government. Considering the popularity of Arab Nationalism, many in the government fear using the Qatari military risks having the troops join the protesters. It is believed British forces will be the most effective in these circumstances and they will preserve the government. The British are keen to help as they have invested heavily in the oil industry in Qatar and would not like to lose access to it, especially as it faces threats of embargoes due to the Suez Crisis."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar announced his proposal for a United Gulf Emirates which would unite all the British protectorates in the Arabian Gulf into one nation. This would see Qatar unite with Bahrain, Kuwait, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden, and Muscat. The Amir notes all these states face threats from regional powers and ideologies that threaten the existing political order. By uniting, they can all resist such challenges together and ensure the people under their rule will be able to prosper under stable governance. In addition, the threat from neighboring, larger states will be nullified. For the British, the proposed state will be strong enough to reduce the dependency on British military power and it can act as a powerful regional state to preserve their interests against the hostile states and ideologies currently proliferating. London has said it will consider the proposal."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.2.d:0 "The British government has announced in principle it accepts the recent proposal by the Amir of Qatar for a United Gulf Emirates. The British government noted current trends in the world indicate British colonies and protectorate in the regions will not be sustainable in the long-term. The United Gulf Emirates promises to combine all these interests into a strong, pro-British state. The British government notes this is the best approach to secure their influence in the region while reducing the costs and also respecting the aspirations of the people living in those states. The United Gulf Emirates will see Qatar unite with Kuwait, Bahrain, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden and Muscat. This action will also halt the decline of Britain in the region and the new state will be a great counter to the ideological threats in the region."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.3.d:0 "The British government announced it is declining the proposal by the Amir of Qatar to form a new nation called the United Gulf Emirates. This new state would have united Qatar with Kuwait, Bahrain, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden, and Kuwait. By unifying all British protectorates and colonies the Qataris hoped to convince London that this would be the best scenario for Britain as it faces the challenges of decolonization. The British government however, noted the proposal was too ambitious and unfeasible, stating it did not believe these multiple states and territories could be able to establish a unified government and would be ripe for instability. At the moment, the British believe the status quo is the best for all the peoples in the region and the nation of Britain."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.4.d:0 "During an elaborate ceremony in Qatar, the United Gulf Emirates signed their independence documents with British officials. The ceremony brought all the various political leaders of the new state and the senior British officials of the region. With this agreement, the former British protectorates and colonies of the Persian Gulf will be united as one. Many believe the British hope this new nation will satisfy the aspiration of the peoples in these lands but also preserve the relationship with Britain and these areas as the leaders were all kept in power by the British, some for many decades. The United Gulf Emirates itself believes its structure will allow its citizens to preserve their independence from regional powers and be a potent player in regional politics."
 QAT_Coronation.1.d:0 "The coronation of Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani concluded in the capital today. The new, young Amir took over in an elaborate ceremony meant to showcase the prestige of Qatar. He takes over a nation undergoing major transformations, especially in its economy as the oil industry continues to grow and expand. However, this new growth has seen a rise in dissent, especially among supporters of Arab Nationalism and labor reform. This threat targets the government and the continued domination of the royal family on the affairs of the state. How the new Amir handles these challenges will remain to be seen. He has already pledged to continue the development and reform policies of his predecessor and promises to modernize Qatar and see it prosper in the coming years."

 #Qatar News Events
 QATAR_UAS.1.d:0 "The United Arab States today welcomed the oil rich nation of Qatar into its ranks. The government of Qatar recently embraced Arab Nationalism and brought many of its supporters within Qatar into positions of influence. For many this appears to be the next natural step as Qatar still needs help with technical training and a larger power to protect its independence after it expelled its former patron Britain. The top leadership of the UAR were in Qatar for a ceremony in which the Qatari government signed the agreement and the flags across the country were changed to the United Arab States flag. Although their was much joy in Qatar and the United Arab States, other regional states were quiet or condemned the decision of Qatar. Many stating this upset the balance of power within the Arab World."
 Mesaieed.1.d:0 "The government of Qatar announced the establishment of Mesaieed today. This settlement is setup next to the main oil facilities and is meant to be the industrial center of the rapidly growing oil industry in the country. It will be the main tanker terminal for Qatar and will be administrated by the petroleum company. The government hopes this new industrial city will help growth in the country as it is also located near the working class neighborhoods of the country. The close proximity will aid in job creation and career development for the citizens of Qatar."
 QATAR_UAR.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar is a surprise statement announced his public support for President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Amir praised his vision for Arab unity and his struggle against imperialism during recent events. The news is being welcomed by many in Qatar who support Arab Nationalism. This support had led to street protests and unrest and many suspect the announcement is meant to appease Qataris. Whether the statement will completely satisfy the Arab Nationalist sympathizers, especially among the oil workers is unknown. Traditionalists and the established elite in Qatar are said to be uneasy by this statement, especially as it risks alienating relations with Britain and the west."
 QATAR_IND.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar has directed the government to end all engagement with British authorities as he announced the abrogation of all treaties with Britain. The Amir states this is in response to the unprovoked attack on Egypt by Britain and their efforts to curb the aspirations of Arabs. He added that Arab Nationalism offers a destiny for the entire Arab World which is what the British are fearful for and Qatar will no longer support this project. Arab Nationalist supporters and oil industry workers have received the news with joy as they have launched street protests against the government and its ties with Britain since the Suez Crisis began. Traditionalists close to the monarchy are noticeably uncomfortable and unsure about this latest announcement and fear the Amir maybe leading Qatar towards a disaster."

 liberal_communism_desc:0 "Liberal Communism preserves the communist state and the supremacy of the party. However, it seeks to reduce or limit the most repressive or coercive elements of a communist system. Non-communist social and political organizations are allowed exist. Public debate and criticism are tolerated, however, the state and Party remain dominant and any attempts to overthrow either is not allowed. Liberal Communism helps bring all segments of the population together and help in a more peaceful socialist society. More traditionalist Communists argue this ideology only weakens the grip of the Party and paves the way for anarchy or counterrevolutionary forces."
 CZE_antonin_novontny_desc:0 "Antonin Novotny grew up in a working-class family near Prague. He trained as a blacksmith before getting involved in politics, eventually being a charter member of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party. During World War II he was arrested by the Nazis and survived the Mauthausen concentration camp. After the war he quickly became a Central Committee member and following purges emerged as the Deputy Prime Minister before becoming the First Secretary of the Party. He is a hardline communist who strongly believes in the strength of the state and Party. His strict policies and authoritarian nature allowed him to consolidate power, however, his continued adherence to such policies are increasingly alienating not only citizens but members of the Party."
 CZE_alexander_dubeck_desc:0 "Born in Slovakia, the parents of Alexander Dubcek soon moved to the Soviet Union to help build socialism and raise him. As a teen they returned to Slovakia where Alexander Dubcek joined the Slovak Communist Party. Dubcek joined the Czechoslovakian Communist Party after World War II, rising to the ranks before joining the National Assembly. He underwent political training in Moscow. Following the turn away from Stalinism, Dubcek helped revive commemorations of Slovak national heroes and historical events. A Central Committee Member with Soviet backing, Dubcek has quickly emerged as the leader of the new anti-Stalinist faction within the party. He may soon be in a position to challenge the leadership."

During World War II he was a frequent target of arrest by the fascist Slovak government and helped organize the national uprising against it. After the war he, oversaw the mass purge anti-communists in Slovakia to ensure communist electoral success. From there he was poised to rise in the ranks but fell victim to a purge. He would eventually be rehabilitated and remain a committed communist, though opposed to the Stalinist factions which had purged him. He is a leading member of the anti-Stalinist faction within the party and considered their main leader in Slovakia. A devoted communist, he believes strongly in the supremacy of the state and socialism."
