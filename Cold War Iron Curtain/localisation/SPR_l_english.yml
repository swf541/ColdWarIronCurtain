In his grand opening in Barcelona, it has seen great success, with revenues and profits soaring beyond expectations, with the potential of expanding throughout Spain and maybe throughout the world. This is surely a great example of the marvels of Spanish entrepreneurship and ingenuity."

 Caudillo:0 "Caudillo de España"
 Francisco_Franco_desc:0 "Born in El Ferrol in 1892, Francisco Franco was a career soldier who rose through the ranks until the mid-1930s. Franco joined the growing rebel movement and soon led an uprising against the leftist Republican government and took control of the country following the Spanish Civil War. After keeping the nation neutral during the Second World War, Franco now is supported by the rest of the West due to his anti-communist views. Although a fascist in his political views and methods, he identifies himself as a 'conservative' and 'monarchist', merely seeking to preserve Spain's tradition and national pride."
 
 Falange.1.d:0 "The Spanish government confirmed the supremacy of its Falangist ideology by passing the Fundamental Principles of the National Movement. These principles lay out the ideological foundation of the Franco state. All senior government officials from now on will have to swear allegiance to these principles in order to take office or positions of authority. The Spanish government espouses an anti-democratic and anti-communist third way that claims to remove any distinction of class. The government believes through dictatorship and order, Spain will regenerate its past glory. Surrendering to the government and embracing the Church are also important elements to the Spanish system. Observers of the Spanish regime however argue that the Falangist ideology is not a third option but just an extreme right ideology. They note the new law further cements the separation of Spain from the wider ideological currents in the world."
 IC_Franco.1.d:0 "\nSpanish dictator Francisco Franco publicly declared the Judeo-Masonic Conspiracy has grown in its threat with the international Jews now operating through global communism as well. Since the early part of his rule, Franco and his supporters have openly espoused a belief in the largely discredited conspiracy that Jews controlled the world through its infiltration of the Free Masons. This conspiracy was popularized in the early twentieth century by the publication of the Protocols of Zion. In addition to this announcement, the government declared it would expand publication and distribution of the Protocols of Zion. The government also directed relevant ministries to prepare an international and domestic campaign to further educate people on this expanded threat."
 SPA_ISR.1.d:0 "Francisco Franco announced a new campaign to raise public awareness of the Jewish threat to the Spanish nation. Franco noted the country could not grow complacent to this threat. He noted the existence of Israel confirms how strong the threat has gotten. In a follow up statement, the government urged Spanish citizens to remain vigilant to the threat. Since Franco came to power, he has actively engaged in antisemitic campaigns and propaganda. Many conservative supporters to the regime have actively argued the decline of Christianity and the Spanish Empire can be directly linked to the actions of an international Jewish conspiracy. The campaign is expected to cause international outrage."
 SPA_MOR.1.d:0 "The government of Spain announced it would hand over administration and sovereignty over the Rif to the new newly independent Moroccan state. The move was well-received by Moroccans and the Arab League. The move reflects a more liberal approach to decolonization being followed by Spain, especially in comparison to some of its European neighbors. Many attribute this to a desire for Spain to end its international isolation since the end of World War II. The emergence of new states from decolonization offer an opportunity for Spain to expand relations to new states and maintain its ideology."
 Juby.1.d:0 "The Spanish government announced it had returned Port Juby to Morocco as per their recent agreement. Morocco had asked Spain to return what it perceives to be its territory under Spanish administration. After much consideration, the Spanish government has agreed and over the previous weeks prepared for a smooth transfer of the territory to Morocco. The move is being well-received across North Africa and observers note this could be an attempt by Spain to cater favor with newly emerging states. The Spanish government has faced isolation from its European neighbors due to its association with the Axis powers during the last war. Decolonization offers an opportunity for Spain to breakout of its international isolation and engage with other states."
 Opus_Dei.1.d:0 "The Opus Dei was founded by Spanish priests in 1928 to act as a spiritual guide for the secular world. Following the Spanish Civil War, the group began to grow among the Franco supporters. By the mid-1940s the group expanded internationally and recently received a Papal endorsement. The Spanish government policy of promoting religious piety and connecting the state with religion made the Opus Dei a perfect fit for Franco supporters. Its status as a secular church institution makes its members able to remain committed to Catholicism but also devoted to the Spanish state. Today, Opus Dei members dominate the Spanish government and offer spiritual guidance and support to leading officials of the state."
 SPA_MOR.2.d:0 "Morocco recently requested Spain return Ifni, which had been ceded by Morocco in 1860. Morocco argues it had been forced to hand the land over due to the threat from colonizing powers but now it must be returned. After much consultations, the Spanish government agreed and as of yesterday, Ifni is now under the administration of Morocco. The last ship of Spanish officials left shortly after the hand-off ceremony. Many observers note the Spanish decision contrasts with many of its European neighbors who have taken a much harsher line on the issue of decolonization. They attribute the decision by Spain to a desire for it to gain favor and new avenues of diplomatic ties to break the international isolation Spain has faced for its wartime cooperation with the Axis powers."
 eng_mobilization.2.d:0 "Some of the 400 warships that constitute the Reserve Fleet of the Royal Navy which includes battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and minesweepers are preparing to set sail due to the global tensions and conflict and acting as an emergency contingency to now rising threats. Thought by many to be an assembly of dead and useless warships the fleet has been mobilized and is currently undergoing finish touches to sail the high seas once again thanks to its brilliant command staff. It shall be ready to replenish the active fleet at any time and the brave sailors of the Royal Navy, with the Standby Fleet already en route to protect British interests overseas and to provide support to the main fleet of the Royal Navy."
 usa_mobilization.1.d:0 "Due to the now increasing tensions and need for a greater military presence, parts of the American mothball fleet, mostly semi-modern ships due to the defence cutbacks of the late 1940s are going to be the first to be recalled to active duty to provide support for the main fleet abroad. With a handful of carriers, destroyers, and cruisers as well as amphibious and auxiliary ships being prepared to set sail once again while the larger and more bulky ships such as heavier cruisers and battleships undergoing some extra work to get ready if needed to be recommissioned, the American public can only wonder if these ships will provide the test of time and if the infallibility of the United States Navy holds true to this day."
 usa_mobilization.2.d:0 "With parts of the Reserve Fleet already having set sail, the rest of the reserve has now completed recommissioning work and sailors flooding onto them as well as naval aviators preparing their aircraft. Numerous carriers, battleships, cruisers, and too many destroyers to count will set sail as the largest ship deployment since the Second World War is taking place. The Navy made a statement that mentions the protection of American interests and the lives of all American sailors aboard ships at sea, they must prepare and to take any action necessary in the defence of the United States of America and her allies."
