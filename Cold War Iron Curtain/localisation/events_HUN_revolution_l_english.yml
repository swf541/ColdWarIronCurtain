 HUNGARIAN_REV.1.d:0 "Laszlo Rajk was recently reinterned with two other victims of post-World War II purges initiated by Hungarian leader Matyas Rakosi. A crowd of nearly a hundred thousand attended the event. This marks the culmination of one of numerous protests demanding Rakosi rehabilitate Laszlo Rajk. Rajk was a popular communist leader and founder of the AVH security agency. Rakosi recently admitted he wrongfully had Rajk put on trial and executed for being a Titoist under pressure from Moscow. Although the actual confession of Rakosi was not published, many in Hungary and within the party are now questioning the ability of the current government which consists of Rakosi selected leaders. This is strengthening opposition against Rakosi. Old guard communists are upset with these developments and blame new Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev for being the source of this new openness that has allowed people to target the party leadership so blatantly."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.2.d:0 "Following the public outpouring over the reinternment of Laszlo Rajk, students in Szeged took their own stand against ruling communist regime. The students reformed the Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students (MEFESZ). This democratic student organization had long been banned when Matyas Rakosi ruled. Instead the only student union allowed was the communist DISZ. Within days, students established MEFESZ in several other cities. This latest provocation indicates the Hungarian people are beginning to lose faith in the communist government under control of Rakosi selected leaders. It appears the issue of student unions is a minor one, but many in the Hungarian Communist Party are concerned this will only build momentum against the party and the legacy of Rakosi it seeks to maintain."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.3.d:0 "With students across Hungary rapidly expressing their political views and aspirations for the first time in decades, students from the Budapest Technical Institute have now joined it. They produced a list of sixteen national policy demands that include, among others, investigations into the Matyas Rakosi regime, free elections, and a removal of Soviet influence from the country. The students in Budapest also announced plans to join and support the Writers Union as they plan to lay a wreath at the statue of famed the 1848 Hungarian Revolution hero, the Polish General Jozef Bem tomorrow. This is meant to be done in solidarity with Polish activists currently fighting for reforms in the country. This event is now likely to draw larger crowds than anticipated. These rapidly unfolding events and passionate crowds are making it very difficult for the government to respond."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.4.d:0 "A massive crowd in the tens of thousands met at the statue of famed General Jozef Bem to lay a wreath and offer support to Polish activists fighting for change. Peter Veres addressed the crowd, calling for Hungarian independence and a liberalization of the socialist system. The crowds sang banned patriotic songs and many began cutting out the communist coat of arms on the Hungarian flag. The energetic crowd than marched to the parliament to join protestors there, bringing the number of protests to over two-hundred thousand. Although the protests did not turn to violence, they are energetic and passionate. Many communist government officials are now fearing the situation is rapidly escalating into anarchy."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.5.d:0 "In light of the recent protests engulfing Budapest, the First Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Erno Gero addressed the country. He condemned the protestors who earlier in the day made counter-revolutionary and incendiary demands from the statue of Jozef Bem and then organized dangerous violence outside parliament. He declared the protestors had no right and rejected all their demands. Although Party hardliners will be happy with the address, the initial response of protestors has been extreme displeasure. They feel the government is ignoring the people and not giving them respect despite their commitment to non-violence and peaceful protest. Many have now openly become revolutionaries."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.6.d:0 "Upon hearing the broadcast of Erno Gero, the agitated protestors decided to carry out one of their demands. They reached the Stalin Monument and tore down the statue of Stalin. The statue had been a gift from the Soviet Union in 1951 and was seen as a symbol of foreign occupation of Hungary. Protesters attacked the head of the statue to express their anger. By the end, only the feet of the statue remained, and a Hungarian flag was put over it. Around the same time, outside the radio station, protestors and AVH members began clashing, amid the chaos the AVH opened fire. A young student, Janos Vizi was instantly killed. The protestors wrapped his body in a Hungarian flag and carried it with them, inflaming the passions of other protestors. The unrest has now further escalated across Budapest and protestors are now resorting to violence."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.7.d:0 "Since Erno Gero addressed the nation, protestors gathered at the main radio station and sent a delegation to rebroadcast their demands to the country. However, the Hungarian security agency, the AVH detained the delegation and refused the demands. Rumors among the protestors over the execution of delegates caused some to try and storm the building. The AVH opened fire, killing protestors and tossed tear gas into the crowds. A failed attempt to bring more arms with an ambulance escalated tension further. When military troops arrived to relieve the AVH, the protestors cheered them as the soldiers had removed their red stars from their hats. The AVH shootings saw protestors light police cars on fire and more significantly, arms depots across Budapest were raided. Weapons are being quickly distributed to ensure protection from further government attacks."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.8.d:0 "With the situation in Budapest quickly spiraling out of control, the Hungarian Communist Party First Secretary Erno Gero called on the Soviet forces in the country to intervene. Gero informed the Soviets that the situation had escalated beyond the capabilities of the government. The Soviet forces in the country have planned for this and after several hours, the Soviet Defense Minister authorized tanks to deploy in Budapest. The Soviet forces moved early in the morning and are expected to be setup positions at the parliament and key junctions by the early afternoon."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.9.d:0 "With the protestors now targeting police, government buildings, and symbols of the communist regime, the AVH security agency has tried to intervene. At government sites under siege, its personnel opened fire on crowds, however, these actions only enraged the protestors not break them up. The swelling and spread of the protests has thinned out AVH deployments and with protestors armed from captured weapons depots, they no longer have the advantage of firepower. Attempts to deploy Hungarian troops in support of the AVH were quickly abandoned as initial deployments saw the troops join the protestors. The clashes continued through the night and early morning. Where protestors are gaining the upper hand, they are openly targeting AVH members."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.10.d:0 "In a stunning turn of events, the Hungarian Prime Minister handed power to Imre Nagy. The popular communist leader had recently been removed from his position as chairman of the Council of Ministers due to his call for reforms and opposition to Soviet interference. In his address to the country, he urged calm and promised that he would initiate the political reforms necessary for the country. This announcement has calmed tensions slightly, however, sporadic clashes are still occurring, and reports indicate the protestors are continuing to arm themselves. Although Nagy enjoys public trust, the arrival of Soviet forces into Budapest and the continued clashes with the AVH is making many concerned the new Prime Minister lacks the means to control the situation."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.11.d:0 "The Soviet intervention has been chaotic with tanks being trapped by barricades erected by protestors. The situation for the AVH continued to deteriorate with their forces being driven from the radio station and increasingly outgunned. Soviet troops gathered outside the parliament were met with massive crowds. AVH members fired on the protestors from nearby buildings, which caused the Soviets to target the AVH, believing they were the ones under attack. Amidst the confusion, armed protestors targeted both sides, further exasperating the tension and chaos. In the next few days, Revolutionary Councils formed to coordinate armed resistance, this has resulted in the Soviets and AVH taking heavy casualties. The Hungarian Communist Party also faced violent retribution from these revolutionaries. With the Hungarian military unwilling to intervene, a ceasefire was eventually arranged by Prime Minister Irme Nagy and the Soviets agreed to withdraw from Budapest to their garrisons."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.12.d:0 "Chairman Mao has penned a letter urging Soviet leader [SOV.GetLeader] to show patience and not intervene in the current Hungarian crisis. Previously the government has expressed support of an intervention and the Soviets appreciated our views on the matter. However, this letter would change our stance and may influence Khrushchev who is concerned of how the wider communist world would view a second intervention. We must decide whether we should ensure the letter reaches Khrushchev immediately to try and prevent an intervention. However, there are those who suggest it may be best to let the matter sit as we have already consulted the Soviets, further comment many only complicate the situation and our relations."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.13.d:0 "The Chinese government provided a letter to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev from Chairman Mao Zedong. In it the Chinese leader urges us not to intervene. He warns of the consequences of such an action and calls for restraint. He has offered the services of China to aid in facilitating a peaceful resolution to the crisis. We have been in constant contact with the Chinese over this issue and their opinion may give us a sense of how the wider communist world may react to an intervention. If Mao is to be believed, an intervention may lead to further schisms and jeopardize the unity of the world socialist movement. We must weigh this advice carefully and decide whether we should take his advice and de-escalate or continue with our preparations."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.14.d:0 "The situation in Hungary continues to deteriorate. Intelligence and military sources liken the situation to an anarchy. The government of Irme Nagy claims to have calmed the situation and restored order. However, we have heard from communist allies in Hungary that Nagy is weak and at the mercy of counter-revolutionary forces. However, we have reports indicating a military intervention such may provoke protest not just in the West but also among fellow socialist states. In addition, we have other reports noting since Nagy was appointed, he has reduced violence and he may be the stabilizing force needed. Many are advocating we continue to monitor the situation. We can certainly reassess and intervene later if needed, this option offers us flexibility. We can intervene now and stop this anarchy from permanently disrupting the links of the Hungarian people to socialism."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.15.d:0 "The Chinese government offered to mediate on talks between us and the Soviet Union. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has apparently accepted the offer and is looking to resolve this issue peacefully. The Chinese added that disputes between revolutionary governments must not lead to violence as this only weakens unity and does not reflect well. It was also hinted that a refusal to attend such talks may result in a massive Soviet military intervention. Agreeing to attend the talks may allow us to preserve some of the dramatic changes we have achieved and help secure our independence from foreign meddling. However, others in the government argue against attending the talks, claiming the risk of Soviet invasion is preferable than making compromises on what the people demand."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.16.d:0 "\nAfter intense negotiations held in southern Poland, the representatives of Hungary and the Soviet Union agreed to a compromise. Only a short time ago it appeared the situation between both nations was leading to armed conflict over the Hungarian Revolution. However, the Chinese government was able to persuade the Soviet Union to let China facilitate talks between both sides and reach a just solution. The details of the final agreement will be released soon but preliminary reports suggest the agreement preserves a number of Hungarian domestic reforms. In exchange, the Hungarians must guarantee their commitment to the Warsaw Pact and socialism. Chinese diplomats oversaw the negotiations and helped facilitate talks to its conclusion. In an official Chinese government statement they announced the new agreement showcases how socialist states resolve disputes through peace, not war, unlike in the West."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.17.d:0 "Prime Minister Irme Nagy, in a commitment to his pledge for political reforms, appointed several non-communists as government ministers. This unprecedented move is meant to calm the revolutionaries in Budapest and restore the faith of the people in the socialist government. This is a stark break from the previous regimes which strictly enforced a one-party system over the country. Irme Nagy has long argued for the need of reforms and opening up the current communist system to accommodate Hungarian political aspirations. The move is already alienating hardline communists in the country who fear Nagy is capitulating to the revolutionaries who they see as counter-revolutionary and agents of the West."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.18.d:0 "Since the Hungarian Revolution began, the principle opposition force has been the AVH security agency. Their members guarded government sites and had violent clashes with protestors. Many of their members are accused of open firing on unarmed protestors. Irme Nagy recently helped negotiate a ceasefire with pro-regime and revolutionary forces. He stated by dissolving the AVH he will end a source of conflict and division. In the place of the AVH the Prime Minister outlined plans for the formation of a National Guard to maintain public order. This new force will consist of armed revolutionaries and government soldiers who will work together to restore peace."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.19.d:0 "During the height of tensions and violence, Hungarian workers had abandoned the government to form local worker councils to control municipal issues and initiate strikes across the country. Realizing these Worker Councils are gaining in popularity, Prime Minister Nagy has authorized the establishment of sanctioned local Councils of Workers to take care of municipal governance and worker conditions. The councils reacted positively to this announcement and the nationwide strike have been lifted. In addition, a delegation of representatives from these councils will soon arrive to visit the Prime Minister and offer their support for his government."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.20.d:0 "In a continuation of the reconciliation policy recently launched by Prime Minister Imre Nagy, the government announced a National Unity government which will consist of several previously banned political parties. He stated these parties, working with his own, will ensure not just order but help determine the future development of the Hungarian nation. This suggest Hungary is headed towards a mutli-party democratic state. This announcement effectively announces the end of the one-party system in Hungary, a key demand of the revolutionaries. The Soviets and hardline communists will not view these developments positively as ideologically, the one-party system is considered an essential component of a developing socialist state. While the Prime Minister is making friends among the opposition, his own party appears to be falling apart amidst these dramatic changes."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.21.d:0 "\nIn a radio address to the country, Prime Minister Imre Nagy announced his intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and engage in a foreign policy of neutrality. For many Hungarians, membership in the Warsaw Pact symbolized the continued control over their country by the Soviets. By withdrawing, Nagy is seeking to restore an independent foreign policy for Hungary. The announcement is also a direct threat to the Soviet Union and its post-World War II order in Eastern Europe. Prime Minister Nagy is hoping the Soviets will respect the will of the Hungarian people and not risk alienating its other allies by taking a harsh stance against the country. It remains to be seen if Nagy is correct in his calculations on Soviet intentions."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.22.d:0 "The latest announcement by Prime Minister Imre Nagy has shaken the Hungarian communists to the core. Many now believe Nagy of not just capitulating to the opposition but openly overseeing the collapse of the socialist order in Hungary. Janos Kader, a senior communist party leader and minister, met with Soviet leadership in Moscow. He informed them that Hungary was not undergoing a socialist adjustment but was falling to counter-revolutionary forces. The liberalization campaign of Nagy had gone far beyond what any other socialist society would allow and the communists of Hungary desperately need the Soviet Union to protect them. He also noted the extra-judicial killings of communist members during the early part of the recent unrest as an example of what will happen if Nagy is not stopped now. With this request from the Hungarian communists, the Soviets must decide whether to intervene or try to make it work with the Nagy government."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.23.d:0 "The Soviet Union has monitored the situation in Hungary closely. Soviet forces stationed in the country tried to help in the early stages but had to withdraw. The subsequent liberalization program announced by Prime Minister Irme Nagy appeared to calm the tensions and although there have been complaints among the Hungarian communists. However, the recent announcement of Hungarian withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and neutrality was a provocation to the Soviet Union. Across the world people awaited the Soviet reaction which came in a statement released from Moscow. In it the Soviets pledge to establish a new relationship with Hungary based on mutual respect and equality. It appears fears of a Soviet military intervention are unfounded, and the Soviets are hoping to engage with the regime diplomatically. What this means to other Warsaw Pact members and the Soviet position in Eastern Europe remains to be seen."
 HUNGARIAN_REV.24.d:0 "The brief but turbulent Hungarian Revolution collapsed in bloodshed as Soviet forces swept across Hungary over the past few days. Prime Minister Imre Nagy's decision to declare Hungary neutral and withdraw from the Warsaw Pact backfired as the Soviets reacted with a military intervention. Soviet forces initially disarmed Hungarian military units and surrounded Budapest. They then assaulted resisting revolutionary forces and after violent urban fighting, Soviet forces prevailed, leaving the city heavily damaged. Prime Minister Nagy and other senior revolutionaries fled to the Yugoslavian embassy in Budapest. The Soviet Union claims it acted after Hungarian communists asked for an intervention to end the counter-revolution and protect communists from further violence as many were executed by the revolutionaries during the early phase of the uprising. The resistance of Hungarians and refusal of its military to join the Soviets indicate not all Hungarians welcomed the action. A new government under Janos Kadar will take over to restore socialism in the country."
 Golden_Team.1.d:0 "The Hungarian national football team has emerged to be the most dominant teams in recent times, called the Golden Team. The team is led by manager Gusztav Sebes, a former trade union organizer. The leading players are Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis, Nandor Hidegkuti, Zoltan Czibor, Jozsef Bozsik, and Gyula Grosics. Sebes has implemented a scientific fitness program, tactical flexibility, and a demand of versatility of all his players. This allows the team to play a much more dynamic game that excites crowds and wins matches. The team has dominated some of the traditional football powerhouses, including a stunning victory over England on their home soil. Their victories are being lauded by the government as an example of the superiority of the socialist man. Among the Hungarians these victories are encouraging national pride, which some communist hardliners are slightly concerned with."
