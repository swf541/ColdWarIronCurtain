 SGP_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Rifle No. 5 Mk I, was a derivative of the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I, Following experience of jungle fighting in the Pacific War the British came to the conclusion that a rifle shorter and lighter than the standard issue, bolt action .303 cal No. 4 rifle was required. However its operational use was in post-war colonial campaigns such as the Malayan emergency, where it gained its common nickname of the Jungle Carbine."

 SGP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The L1A1 SLR is a British version of the Belgian FN FAL battle rifle. It was produced under license and has seen use in numerous Commonwealth nations. The United Kingdom produced its own variant of the FN FAL incorporating the modifications developed by the Allied Rifle Committee, designating it the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR). The weapons were manufactured by the Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield, Birmingham Small Arms, Royal Ordnance Factory and ROF Fazakerley. After the production run ceased, replacement components were made by Parker Hale Limited. The SLR served the British Armed Forces from 1954 until approximately 1994, being replaced by the L85A1 from 1985 onwards."

The U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a forward assist and corresponding notches in the bolt carrier. The M16A1 was the finalized production model in 1967 and was produced until 1982. To address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, bird-cage flash suppressor replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced."
