 Nazimuddin.1.d:0 "Khawaja Nazimuddin has agreed to become the second Prime Minister of Pakistan. The former Governor-General was seen by many to be the least controversial choice due to his record. As Governor-General he exercised political neutrality in politics. The fact that both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan openly supported him before their deaths also made Nazimuddin the ideal candidate to become Prime Minister. Prime Minister Nazimuddin is from Dacca and will be the first Bengali head of government in Pakistan. Among his first acts was to make Malik Ghulam the new Governor-General. He comes to power amidst rising political discontent from provincial nationalists and has expressed he will continue the conservative approach of his predecessor. A new era of Pakistani politics has begun. However, critics are already noting his aristocratic background and the political backlash from his Basic Principles Report do not bode well for him." 
 Language_Debate.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin ignited controversy over his remarks in Dacca last month. He stated that Jinnah was right to say that for national unity, Urdu must be the only language for Pakistan. Although a Bengali, Nazimuddin remains staunchly committed to the Pakistan envisioned by Jinnah and his background as an Urdu-speaking aristocrat clouded his understanding of how sensitive the Bengali people were over the language issue. The announcement led to the formation of language committees demanding recognition for Bengali as a national language. Today, language demonstrators took to the streets of Dacca in massive numbers, despite a government ban on unlawful assembly. The protestors, mostly students, have met at the University and are gathering in large numbers. The police and East Pakistani authorities are ready to act." 
 Language_Debate.2.d:0 "At Dacca University where students were protesting over the language issue, police were able to cordon off areas and used tear gas to break up protestors. As students fled, some were detained for violating the government orders and this apparently enraged the crowd. This crowd moved to the East Pakistan Assembly Building to demand their grievances be heard and as they appeared to be storming into the building, police opened fire, killing at least six but likely more students. The news of the shooting had caused citizens in Dacca to start a general strike. Over the next two days more protestors took to the streets and there were more police shootings. Support for the government dwindles among the Bengalis as they turn increasingly to left-leaning parties. The leftists promise to support the will of the people and pledge to support the language movement." 

 PAK_Military.0.d:0 "A number of British military officers were retained following partition to fill the gaps and prepare officers to take important positions throughout the military command. During the recent Kashmir War, the British officers disobeyed government orders to deploy Pakistani troops to the front, greatly hindering the war-effort. The government believes removing these officers is essential for national security. To achieve this, the government recently announced it would offer British officers serving in the Pakistan Army only a one-year extension to their current contracts, set to expire soon. This has seen virtually all the British officers decline the extension and in response the government announced Pakistan would see the nationalization of the Army in a few months. The Air Force and Navy however, will retain many British officers out of necessity, but they will be phased out in the following years. The press has greatly welcomed this nationalization effort by the military. Pakistani Army officers are also excited of the prospect of rapid promotions to fill the new gaps." 
 PAK_Military.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan has announced General Ayub Khan has assumed the responsibilities of Army Chief for the Pakistan Army. He is the first native service head and his promotion has led to great fanfare in the press. The tall, Pathan officer is the son of a colonial railroad official and was one of the first Indians to be commissioned in the British Indian Army after graduating from the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He served as a Colonel during World War II, leading operations in Burma. After the war he has held senior command positions in both West and East Pakistan. Upon taking over, the General pledged the loyalty of the Army to Pakistan and pledged he would lead efforts to begin incorporating ethnic groups long excluded from the military by the colonial state and build a truly national force for the nation. His comments were well-received by the press." 

 Bogra_PM.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin was removed from office by Governor-General Ghulam Malik who invoked special powers from the 1935 Government of India Act. Some welcome the decision as Nazimuddin proved ineffective during both the language debate, the riots in Lahore, and in stopping the increasing popularity of leftist parties in the country. However, others are uneasy about the Governor-General using powers put in place by the colonial regime to ensure they controlled the governance of India. To replace Nazimuddin, the Governor-General recalled the relatively unknown ambassador to the United States, Mohammad Ali Bogra and has convinced him to be the new Prime Minister. The appointment of a career diplomat has surprised the nation and many question if he will be able to manage the increasingly divided political landscape. However, a middle-class Bengali there is hope he can calm tensions in East Pakistan. Popular in Washington, the United States is said to be excited by the new PM." 
 Bogra_PM.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Ali Bogra at the Constituent Assembly laid out what is being called the Bogra Formula. The Prime Minister calls his proposals a political compromise for both wings of the country, it envisions a National Assembly based on proportional representation and a Senate with equal representation from the four provinces of West Pakistan, essentially ending one unit. He also proposed a formula for reserved seats which would ultimately lead to a parliament in which East Pakistan had more seats but through the reserved system, the West Pakistani representatives would balance out. Issues between the houses would be resolved in a joint session and the Governor-General position would lose many powers and the title would change to President. The compromise is being widely praised across the country However, the curbing of powers and shifting power towards the legislative branch is said to be making the Governor-General, military leaders, and civil service officers nervous."
 Bogra_PM.3.d:0 "Although Prime Minister Ali Bogra has worked very hard to finalize a constitution, both the one unit and his Bogra formula have stalled to facilitate a final constitution. The Constituent Assembly recently concluded that Governor-General Ghulam Malik has been hindering efforts at a political compromise in the country. In an effort to take control of the situation, the Prime Minister allowed the Constituent Assembly to discuss laws which would restrict the powers of the Governor-General and prevent him from dismissing the current government as he did with its predecessor. Ghulam Malik has responded by dismissing the Constituent Assembly, though he has not removed the Bogra government. Members of the assembly have taken the Governor-General to court over his action and in the midst of this political infighting, the Governor-General has asked for medical leave. Ghulam Malik has left the country for treatment abroad and the Interior Minister, career civil service officer Iskander Mirza has been appointed acting Governor-General." 
 Bogra_PM.4.d:0 "Iskandar Mirza, the acting Governor-General, immediately began conflicting with Prime Minister Ali Bogra. He felt Bogra and his plans for a constitutional compromise were going to dramatically increase the disparity of power between the provinces and lead the country to ruin. Prime Minister Ali Bogra was quite adamant that he wanted to give the country a constitution and began discussing with political allies plans to curb the powers of the Governor-General when a new assembly arrived. However, Mirza acted first, he announced the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Bogra and informed the Governor-General he had stepped in for, Ghulam Malik, that he was also dismissed. Although Ali Bogra officially resigned, many believe the Governor-General forced him to step down. The now former Prime Minister has returned to his former position as the ambassador to the United States. As a new legislative assembly begins to take form, many believe the new Governor-General will pick the political faction that guarantees his power." 
 
 COMPAK_Kashmir.1.d:0 "Flush with Soviet arms and imbued with confidence by his Soviet advisors, General Akbar Khan has presented the Party with an ultimatum. The General noted the officers like him who supported the coup did so out of a belief that action was needed in Kashmir before India grew too powerful. Now Akbar Khan has declared the time is ripe for action to resolve Kashmir successfully. The senior Party leadership read this demand for action and believe the country is not ready for such action as the revolution continue. However, they do believe there are two options. One is to give Akbar Khan the greenlight to initiate a border skirmish with India, this should sate the appetite of the military for a time. The other option is to remove Akbar Khan and replace him with someone more cool-headed like General Musa Khan"
 COMPAK_Kashmir.2.d:0 "The recent conflict ended in victory for our forces. Due to the revolutionary fervor and skill of our forces we triumphed over our enemy. They lack proper motivation to resist our forces. The nation was galvanized by our success and those who participated in the operations are being extensively praised in the media. The military high command is now doubt feeling very good with the results and will be satisfied for the time being. The political leadership is also happy with the outcome as they are using it as justification for why the revolution was necessary. The limited scope of the operation was enough to satisfy our objectives and not enough of an escalation to push the Indians to expand their operations. With this success we will continue to build our military and prepare for a future final resolution to our dispute with the Indians. The India media is downplaying recent events as a minor border skirmish with not clear result."
 COMPAK_Kashmir.3.d:0 "Despite the gallant and brave efforts of our armed forces on the border, the recent fighting did not go as we had hoped. The enemy proved much tougher than anticipated. Our media is portraying the battles as a heroic effort with successes, though within the military the truth is widely known and morale took a blow at this setback. Some officers are even rumbling that the recent purges and new direction were the cause of the failed performance. Those officers we identified will be dealt with. Despite the failure, the results have cooled some of the more hawkish leaders within the military. It will greatly strengthen the hands of our party and political leadership. We can concentrate on transforming the country and building up the capabilities and revolutionary fervor of our military. When the time comes, we will strike the blow that will not only liberate the people of Kashmir but all workers in India."

 Bangladesh_Independence.1.d:0 "News of Ayub Khan assuming the Presidency has sent massive crowds surging across East Pakistan, especially in Dacca. The people of East Pakistan have long felt neglected by the center and this newest development appears to have confirmed their suspicion that the coup was a plot by the West Pakistani dominated military to seize the country for itself, especially since it had now removed Iskandar Mirza, a Bengali. Surging crowds in Dacca marched largely unchallenged as local police appeared unwilling to intervene. The small number of soldiers from the 14th Division guarding the East Pakistan Assembly were forced to fight their way to the cantonment area, resulting in heavy civilian and military casualties. The cantonment is now under a virtual siege and the locally raised East Pakistan Rifles battalions across East Pakistan are defecting to the people in droves. Virtually all their West Pakistani compatriots are now under armed guard." 
 Bangladesh_Independence.2.d:0 "Since independence the Pakistani government has maintained a small garrison in East Pakistan consisting of the 14th Division. This force is based from the Dacca cantonment but is currently under siege by rioting Bengali protestors opposed to the coup launched by the military. In West Pakistan, the military has calculated its options are limited as an airlift of reinforcements is not feasible. The rebels in Dacca seized the East Pakistan Assembly and are proclaiming their succession from Pakistan, claiming the independence of Bangladesh. The only other forces are locally raised East Pakistan Rifles who have largely defected and have taken their West Pakistani colleagues as prisoners. The rebel forces stated they will allow all Pakistani military personnel to leave the country, if the government promises not to engage in armed conflict. The commander of the 14th notes his forces are desperately short of equipment but will fight if ordered by the government, despite their families being with them in the cantonment."  
 Bangladesh_Independence.3.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced that it would not risk the lives of its soldiers on a hopeless display or risk the loss of innocent civilians who would be caught in the crossfire. President Ayub Khan noted that an airlift was already underway, with aircraft from several friendly states arriving to Dacca to help the transportation of the 14th Division, West Pakistani military personnel with the East Pakistan Rifles, and loyal government employees back to West Pakistan. He stated the government views Bangladesh as a rebellious territory but states it will seek talks in the future to eventually reunite the country. Many in West Pakistan are happy to see the violence end and the troops return, but there is a deep sense of anger brewing. Many argue an independent Bangladesh threatens the basis of the existence of Pakistan and many on the left note this dramatic transformation would not have occurred had the military stayed in its barracks."
 Bangladesh_Independence.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government ordered the 14th Division to hold out till the end for the honor of their country and then rejected the demands from the so-called Bangladeshi government. Within hours rebel fighters, bolstered by the arrival of defecting Pakistani units, engaged in street to street fighting around the cantonment. The Pakistani forces held on for several days before running out of ammunition and were soon overwhelmed. Both sides took heavy military casualties but also civilian casualties as residential areas became battlegrounds. In the chaos the families of military personnel living in the cantonments also took losses due to the fighting and its aftermath. The surviving military personnel and the military families are being held in detention. The Bangladeshi government passed a resolution honoring the heroic sacrifices of their people against the Pakistani state and noted Pakistan send thousands into combat for no reasonable purpose. Internationally the Pakistani action is being strongly condemned but domestically, the people are rallying behind the government and their martyrs."

 PAK_ECON.1.d:0 "At independence Pakistan inherited one of the largest jute producing regions of the world in East Pakistan and major cotton producing areas in West Pakistan. The government has development funds and must decide on whether to use those funds to build cotton processing facilities in West Pakistan or jute processing facilities in East Pakistan. Some officials note such an investment will help make Pakistani cotton more competitive on the global market. While others argue that the jute industry has great potential, but partition left many of their processing facilities in Indian Bengal. Putting these facilities in East Pakistan will help restore the jute industry and allow it to thrive."
 PAK_ECON.2.d:0 "One of the pressing issues facing Pakistan at independence was the lack of banks and finance available to the new nation. The establishment of the National Bank of Pakistan has helped alleviate the commercial banking demand. It opened its first branch in East Pakistan to help the jute industry. Now the bank is looking to expand and open new branches. One group of officials believe the bank should open up more locations in Karachi the rapidly growing capital of the country. Others argue that the success in East Pakistan should be expanded and more branches will lead to more growth for the province." 
 PAK_ECON.4.d:0 "The colonial British had long neglected the North West Frontier Province NWFP due to its difficult conditions and role in the Anglo-Afghan Wars. The federal budget has some extra surplus cash that can be spent on improving roads in the province. However, an alternative option is available in East Pakistan, where in the interior there is also a shortage of roads and infrastructure improvements. While what is today East Pakistan did provide extensive raw materials during the colonial period, much of the infrastructure investment went to what is now Indian Bengal. Using that surplus to improve the infrastructure in East Pakistan maybe more useful than investing in the NWFP."
 PAK_ECON.3.d:0 "The Finance Minister informs us that two growing corporations are interested in receiving extensive credit from the national bank to support an expansion into the steel manufacturing market. One is the Lahore based Mughal Traders company. They originally were iron and steel importers but want to establish their own production facilities. The other company which has applied for an expansion is BSRM. This company already has a small steel mill but with to expand and modernize their equipment to ramp up production. Both companies have sound proposals but we can only afford to support the expansion of one."	
 PAK_ECON.5.d:0 "Since independence, both Karachi and Chittagong have risen in prominence. Both are vital ports for the country. In addition, both have seen an influx in refugees trying to find a new life in Pakistan. The cabinet has recently received development funding requests from the two cities. Both would like to expand their ports and incentivize industrial development to offer employment for newly arrived residents. As our country is still growing and does not come from immense wealth, it is up to the cabinet to decide who receives this development. Supporters for Chittagong argue it deserves more development as Dacca reaps the most resources. Karachi backers note that since the city is the federal capital, the government should support efforts to make it more developed and appealing to not just the people but international visitors as well."	

 INDIA_PAK_COM.1.d:0 "The Communist Party of Pakistan CPP formed months after independence during the 2nd All-India Conference of the Communist Party of India. Over the next few weeks, in Dacca, the ruling CPP will host its first All-India Party Conference with representatives from the Indian Communist Party. The two parties have already announced they will work closely together and renew their shared history. However, the conference will also discuss three major issues. One is whether Pakistan should begin the process of being a base for the export of revolution into India or its neighbors. The second is whether Pakistan will open its borders and allow Indian communist activists and workers to come and help the country. Finally, the question of nationalism and Bengal will also be decided."	
 Bengal_Question.1.d:0 "The Bengali delegates of both the Indian Communist Party and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP sit together and often vote together throughout the conference. This powerful voting block has brought to the discussion the idea of respecting national sovereignty and argue the revolution can be more effectively implemented if East Pakistan is allowed total autonomy. A Socialist Republic of Bangladesh would be able to directly mobilize workers and peasants as they are more advanced in their class consciousness than in West Pakistan. Finally, they could also help speak to and mobilize the Indian Bengali working class. The CPP leadership has carefully considered this proposal and there is a lot of support for the proposal. However, there are many who fear that dividing the country will alienate the reactionary and anti-revolutionary classes in Pakistan who will try to exploit such a move as a sign of weakness. This will be the last topic for the conference to decide on."	

 Ayub_Khan.1.d:0 "General Ayub Khan, the Chief Martial Law Administrator announced that Iskander Mirza and resigned from office and had transferred his powers to him. The General announced he would take the title of President, promote himself to Field Marshal and step down as the Army Chief. The new Army Chief will be General Muhammad Musa. President Ayub Khan promised that the military intervention will last only until the nation has a system of government which will act in the interest of all citizens and not be vulnerable to the corruption and dirty politics of the last decade. Many in Pakistan are applauding the new President as they saw Mirza as a part of the old political class. His resignation and flight to London is being seen by observers as evidence that Ayub Khan has won the struggle for leadership in Pakistan."
 Ayub_Khan.2.d:0 "President Ayub Khan in recent weeks has been holding meetings with senior bureaucrats, civil service officers, and judicial officials. He noted that since independence it has been them and the military who have kept the Pakistani state functioning as politicians constantly wrangled and worked to overthrow one another, leading to inefficiency in political leadership. The President called on these groups to work with him and ensure the Pakistani people have more effective government and that the administration of the country is not negatively impacted by the Martial Law regime. He noted the military has little knowledge on governance and their support will be vital. These senior officials were very receptive to the President and it appears a nexus of a military-civil service alliance is being formed to run the country." 
 
 Gilgit.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan confirmed it had taken over direct administration over Gilgit-Balistan and the Azad Kashmiri government agreed to hand over administration. The reason for this is that Gilgit-Balistan is that the more populous Gilgit region is not directly linked to Azad Kashmir. More importantly, during the Kashmir War it was the Gilgit Scouts, led by Major William Brown, and the people of the area who liberated themselves from the Kashmiri government, they pledged their loyalty not to a new independent Kashmir but to Pakistan. The Indian government has condemned this announcement and claim we are annexing Gilgit-Balistan from historical Kashmir to ensure in a future peace deal we do not risk losing those lands. Our government has dismissed the Indian suggestion as ludicrous." 
 USA_PAK.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Pakistan recently concluded an extensive state visit to the United States. The high-power trip saw the Prime Minister arrive with senior cabinet ministers. During the trip the ministers met with their counterparts while the Prime Minister held extensive talks with the President. The Prime Minister also addressed Congress, informing them of the aspirations and early struggles of Pakistan. He toured major landmarks and at the Pentagon he emphasized his desire to see Pakistan armed to deal with any threat, especially communism. The visit ended with a glamourous state dinner and before the Prime Minister left, he invited the American President to visit Pakistan soon. The American media was quite impressed with the Prime Minister while the media in Pakistan noted, with pride, the impressive protocol afforded their leader. The American President promised to help address the agricultural shortages facing Pakistan." 
 
 Rawalpindi.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister recently learned of a plot against the government involving military officers and senior leftists by the Army Chief. The information comes from one of the alleged plotters who reported he had attended a party in which he saw prominent leftists present with at least one senior general. He stated they made statements disparaging the current leadership for not mobilizing the population and invading Kashmir as soon as possible. The officer added he believed they were discussing how positive it would be for the Army to establish a new, leftist government, but stated he did not hear any concrete planning. The Army Chief has asked the Prime Minister if he would like to act and arrest the conspirators or leave them be. Although arresting the conspirators would root out the threat, some advisors suggest the information received is scant and making the arrests may end up making the government look weak and embarrass the military." 
 Rawalpindi.2.d:0 "The nation was stunned today as newspapers published a press release from the Prime Minister in which he revealed the arrest of fifteen military officers and prominent leftist activists, including members of the Communist Party of Pakistan over a plot to overthrow the government. The statement noted that General Akbar Khan sought to violently overthrow the government and install a communist regime in order to launch a campaign of internal repression and war. The arrested officers include several colonels and majors while famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was among the leftists arrested. All the conspirators will be swiftly tried and brought to justice. Many in Pakistan applaud the swift action by the Prime Minister to sweep up this Rawalpindi Conspiracy. However, critics note the lack of evidence presented in the statement and some are suggesting the Army itself may not be trustworthy." 
 Rawalpindi.3.d:0 "Highly organized communist cadres in Dacca and Karachi simultaneously stormed government buildings this morning. They took many politicians and officials hostage and when the Prime Minister called the military headquarters to demand action. However, upon calling he discovered most senior commanders were being detained and communist sympathizing senior officers had taken over GHQ. With GHQ under their control, the coup leaders ordered local military units not to intervene against the communist cadres and soon the government had capitulated to the coup led by General Akbar Khan. Over the previous years, a conspiracy involving military officers and leading leftists saw sympathetic officers be shifted to strategic positions and the mobilization of communist cadres to act at the right moment. General Akbar Khan has so far minimized the possibility of a counter-coup by detaining the senior generals and by his reputation as the famed commander of freedom fighters during the Kashmir War." 
 Rawalpindi.4.d:0 "The recent coup saw an alliance of leftist activists, disgruntled military officers, and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP act in coordination to seize power. In a recent party meeting, the CPP has announced the appointment of famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz as the new leader of Pakistan. He has a strong following and leftist credentials due to his poetry while his background as a former military officer makes him acceptable to many of the leftist officers. He will coordinate efforts by the party to unite the factions and begin the process of transforming Pakistan and ending inequality. General Akbar Khan, who led the military officers and Sajjad Zaheer, the former head of the CPP both recognize they lack the national appeal of Faiz Ahmed Faiz but are expected to rule closely with him and were given senior positions."

 PAK_ASSASIN.2.d:0 "In a stunning tragedy, beloved Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan was gunned down in Rawalpindi today. He was addressing citizens at a park when the gunman struck. Police officers immediately returned fire, killing the assassin. The assassin was identified as Said Khan, an Afghan national. The government are investigating his motives, but it appears this was the act of a disturbed individual and not a conspiracy, though many in the country suspect an Afghan plot. The nation is already said to be in mourning with messages of sympathy arriving from neighboring sates and leading politicians in both Pakistan and India. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan leaves behind a wife and three children."
 PAK_ASSASIN.1.d:0 "The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan has plunged Pakistan into mourning but also a palpable sense of uncertainty. Prime Minister Ali Khan had guided Pakistan through the difficult early years of independence, and he was seen as the only leader capable of guiding the Constituent Assembly on its difficult mission to create a constitution. For the Muslim League, the loss of Liaquat Ali Khan has led to renewed fears the party may collapse. Ali Khan masterfully kept the many groups attached to the party unified and it remains to be seen if the party will endure without him. The Prime Minister post now needs a new leader and members of the Constituent Assembly are struggling to come up with a leader who has national legitimacy. Many are calling on the Governor General to stepdown and take over as no one in the assembly appears capable. To the people of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan has become the Shaheed-e-Millat, Martyr of the Nation."

 PAK_Constitution.0.d:0 "Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan commissioned Khawaja Nazimuddin to establish a committee to determine the underlying principles that would determine the future constitution. The report was recently released. The report argued only Urdu would be the national language and proposed a legislature that split the seats evenly with West and East Pakistan. It also called on creating a ulema council to study all laws and confirm they conformed to Islam. The report has seen a huge backlash in the press, especially from minorities and Bengalis in East Pakistan. Minorities find the ulema council to be problematic. Bengalis have criticized the language provision and equal seats, noting that equaling the representation of both wings was undemocratic and ignored the fact that East Pakistan had a larger population. Upon hearing this backlash, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan asked the committee to reconvene and resubmit the form later." 
 PAK_Constitution.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The government declared an end to all colonial era laws and regulations which had been governing the country as it worked on making the constitution. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It would be a parliamentary system with only one house, called the National Assembly. East and West Pakistan will each have an equal number of representatives. The President will be ceremonial but possess emergency powers if needed and the national languages will be Urdu, English, and Bengali. The government is being praised for its efforts as it worked closely with the opposition to pass finalize the document. Governor-General Iskandar Mirza will become President. Although the constitution is being well-received there are some concerns over the Presidential emergency powers and the provisions giving the Centre a free reign to interfere in provincial government matters."
 PAK_Constitution.2.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ending the last visages of colonialism. It would be a parliamentary system, with two houses. Although the seats will be divided proportionally to population, giving East Pakistan more seats, the constitution has provisions for reserved seats which when added together creates parity. The constitution is very similar to the Bogra formula and emphasizes the importance of an independent judiciary. The country will have three national languages, Bengali, Urdu, and English and provincial rights are guaranteed by the parliament. However, the President, though largely ceremonial does have certain emergency powers to remove provincial and federal governments. It is believed this was added to ensure the Governor-General and future President Iskandar Mirza approved the document."
 PAK_Constitution.3.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Nation of Pakistan. The new constitution envisions a two-house parliament, one made up exclusively of Muslim men of character. The other consisting of ulema from across the country. The constitution defined Muslims as those who believe the finality of the prophet and declared the Sharia Court to be the highest court in the country. The head of state will be the Sadar-e-Mumlikat meaning head of state and this office will be held by the current Governor-General, Iskandar Mirza. In the future, this position will be elected by the two houses form among its members. This position also possesses emergency powers, which some suggest was the cost demanded by Mirza before he approved the constitution. The reaction among the elites, minorities, and those connected to the government has been pure horror over the new constitution." 

 PAEC.1.d:0 "The government confirmed the establishment of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission PAEC. This is the culmination to the decision by Pakistan to engage in the Atoms for Peace program of the United States. The independent body brings together the leading nuclear and physics scientists of Pakistan origin who will work to develop nuclear energy as a solution to the growing demand for energy. The first chairman will be the highly respected experimental physicist Dr. Nazir Ahmed. The PAEC announced it has no intentions of engaging in weapons research and hopes to utilize this new technology for the benefit of the Pakistani people. The United States notes Pakistan has shown a keen interest in this energy technology form the beginning and looks forward to helping the country achieve its energy needs. Scholarships and funding for young Pakistani scientists will be distributed by the PAEC to build the knowledge base necessary for a peaceful nuclear program." 
 PAK_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government recently offered a no war pact with our government. This was meant to embarrass us internationally and try to portray Pakistan as a nation itching for war. In response to their offer, our government gave a press conference and noted that Pakistan would love nothing more than to have peaceful relations with India and dreams of both nations working side by side for the security of South Asia. However, India is well aware that we cannot agree to such a treaty as long as the festering wound of Kashmir remains. If the Indian government implements the UN resolutions and works to resolve the issue in a way that recognizes the wishes of Kashmiris, then certainly a no war pact would be reasonable. But given the present circumstances, such a pact is impossible to seriously consider." 
 Afghan_PAK.20.d:0 "Since the independence of Pakistan, Afghanistan has constantly challenged us internationally. Afghanistan voted against our entrance to the United Nations are said to be trying to stir up tribal uprisings against our government. This dates back to the British period when Afghanistan claimed the Pathans residing in our lands belong to them. Now the Afghans claim their treaties with the British no longer apply and they have claim to our western territories with Pathan populations. Considering the tensions with India, many in the government feel continued conflict with Afghanistan only hurts us. However, others suggest having a hardline, tough approach to the Afghans will ensure they do not try and stab us in the back. We control their access to international goods, we can threaten them about it." 
 Gwadar.1.d:0 "The port of Gwadar has long been under the administration of the Omani Sultan. His claim to the port were secured by agreements with the British and the neighboring Princely State of Makran, who previously controlled the port. After Pakistan gained independence, Makran joined the country but Gwadar remained under Omani rule. Recently, the Pakistani government approached the Omani government and after friendly negotiations, the Omanis have agreed to return Gwadar to Pakistan under a sale of purchase. The agreement shows how Muslim brothers can work together to work in the interests of the people and is a contrast to the Indians who often utilize brute force when dealing with land claims. With Gwadar secure, West Pakistan now has a second deep water port it can develop in the future." 
 Khan_PAK.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Zafarullah Khan has proven to be an amazing asset for our government. Since independence he has not only eloquently defended our government, but he helped push key UN resolutions over Kashmir that demanded their right of self-determination be preserved. In those early debates on Kashmir he constantly outmaneuvered his Indian opponents and made sure no power vetoed the resolutions passed. He also played a major role in aiding UN discussions during the Palestine Partition and has strengthened our ties with the United States by openly condemning communist aggression internationally. He remains a thorn to the Indian propaganda effort over Kashmir and is viewed as a great spokesman for Kashmir at home and an esteemed statesman abroad." 

 Lahore_Riots.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin has received an ultimatum from an alliance of ulema called the Majlis-i-Amal. The ultimatum calls for the removal of Ahmadis from government offices and the declaration that Ahmadis are non-Muslim. The conflict is over the belief by many mainstream Muslim communities that the Ahmadis, who claim to be a Muslim sect, are not Muslims as they do not believe in the finality of the prophet. Although the Prime Minister is a conservative with a strong religious belief, he is a strict constitutionalist and has rejected the ultimatum. Unfortunately, this decision has led to riots erupting in Lahore where supporters of the Majlis-i-Amal are ransacking, looting, and destroying the homes, businesses, and houses of worship of the Ahmadis living there. The police are said to be joining the rioters and now the Prime Minister must call martial law and deploy the troops." 
 Lahore_Riots.2.d:0 "The anti-Ahmadi riots which engulfed the city weeks earlier has largely come to an end. After the Prime Minister deployed the Pakistan Army to restore order and implement martial law, the citizens of the country were excited by how quickly the Army succeeded. Within hours of entering the city, violence began to decline as troops strictly imposed curfew. Unlike the police, military discipline held, and none joined the protestors. Martial law remains in place but life in the city is returning to normal. The main imams involved in the protests were sentenced to death by military courts, though many suspect the sentences will be commuted to life terms. The people of Lahore report friendly interactions with the Army. A beautification program launched by the Army has some residents joking the military is leaving Lahore nicer than before the riots. Some in Pakistan now wonder if the boys in khaki offer more stability than the politicians in Karachi." 
 PAK_1955.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has reconvened after its dismissal by the Governor-General. The new assembly consists of three factions, the Triple Alliance, which combines the divided conservative faction that has governed the country since partition. The United Front also has supporters in the assembly, they consist of leftists, many from East Pakistan who were recently galvanized over the language debate. They also benefit from the perception that East Pakistanis are being undermined by the establishment. Finally, there is the Jamaat-i-Islami, the main Islamist party in the country. The Jamaat continues to struggle politically due to its opposition over the creation of Pakistan but still has an impressive network of grassroots networks across the country. The Governor-General must decide whether to keep the Triple Alliance in power, go with the popular but dangerous United Front, or let the Jamaat-i-Islami take power." 
 Ahmedi.1.d:0 "The parliament recently passed a new bill which it claimed solves the Ahmadi Question permanently. The bill declares Ahmadis to be non-Muslim as they do not meet the constitutional requirements of what a Muslim is and releases all those convicted of involvement in the recent Lahore Riots. The bill notes those Muslims who participated were driven by passion and a desire to protect the faith and cannot be punished for doing the will of God. The bill bans Ahmadis from being buried in Muslim cemeteries or from calling their houses of worship mosques. News of the bill has already seen many Ahmadi businesses shutdown and houses go for sale. Western embassies are being bombarded with applications for asylum and one of the largest business communities in Lahore appears to be leaving the country in droves." 
 PAK_REl.1.d:0 "The Jamaat-i-Islami government announced it would expand the number of imams on bases and within military units. In addition, it noted the Chaplain Corps will be renamed the Imam Corps as they expect to announce the removal of non-Muslims from the armed forces in the next few years. The increase in imams is meant to improve the morale of the fighting men and the imams will have a higher rank than previously. They will also observe and ensure rules of the faith are being observed. Although the military did not respond to this announcement, many believe the military is furious at this intervention into its structure and discipline. Many officers note their forces are already motivated by patriotism and religious fervor to defend the country and the government clearly does not trust them."

 mongolia.3.d:0 "\nDespite the enthusiasm among the Mongolian communist leaders, the Soviet Union rejected their application to become a constituent republic within the country. Although the Soviets appreciate the Mongolian commitment to socialism and the Soviet model, many among the Soviets believe the nation is far too undeveloped to be incorporated. There were also some fears that incorporating Mongolia may end up antagonizing the Soviet socialist allies in China and East Asia. The Mongolian government was said to be disappointed by the decision and pledged it would continue the revolutionary development of the country with Soviet guidance. Within the Mongolian communist party however, there are rumors that many within the party opposed the plan and may have privately urged Soviet officials to reject the proposal as well."
 mongolia.11.d:0 "The Mongolian communist party concluded public discussions and reports regarding the past transgressions and excesses of violence which occurred during the Great Purge from 1937 to 1939. The Party regrets the loss of lives and cultural destruction during the period. More importantly, the Party decided to rehabilitate purged party members who were condemned for being overly nationalistic. Many in the party blame the role of Soviet advisors, especially from the NKVD who are accused of directing and controlling the violence, which included torture and the establishment of prison camps. The communist leader of the period, the beloved Marshal Choibalsan was also criticized for committing mistakes during this time and building a cult of personality. Some of the party old guard is uncomfortable with these proceedings."
 mongolia.20.d:0 "General Secretary Dashiin Damba has recently been removed from power following a power struggle within the Mongolian communist party. Damba had recently played a major role in de-Stalinization efforts along with pushing the country to engage with other socialist oriented Asian powers instead of just the Soviet Union. The Party old guard took umbrage to the de-Stalinization, especially criticism of the former leader, Marshal Choibalsan. It is this faction which orchestrated the ouster of Damba and the purge of his close associates. The Soviet Union is likely to be satisfied with this development as this will help solidify the leadership of the pro-Moscow faction in the party."
 mongolia.21.d:0 "During in extraordinary Central Committee meeting, Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal was removed from office. A major figure in the party since he first became General Secretary in 1940, his removal indicates the party had grown wary of his industrialization efforts and devotion to Moscow. His removal is likely the result of the recent de-Stalinization efforts which heavily criticized Tsedenbal party mentors. His association with the previous leadership has made his position untenable as the newer party leadership wishes to move on. The new Prime Minister has not been named yet but will be expected to keep ties strong with Moscow and also push Mongolia into stronger relations with other Asian socialist states. It is unknown whether Tsendenbal has been stripped of his party membership or simply removed from senior posts."
 AJAX.900.d:0 "The new Iranian government of Ahmad Qavam consented to the restoration of the Qajar dynasty. The young Hamid Mirza Qajar, son of the former Crown Prince will become Shah. The Iranian government characterized this as a restoration of a historical wrong. Noting Reza Pahlavi usurped the throne through machinations, violence, and with foreign forces. It was this tendency of ruthlessness and consorting with foreign powers that kept the Iranian nation weak in recent years. The Qajar restoration brings back a dynasty from the eighteenth century and will reinvigorate the natural connections between not just the monarchy and the people but also the monarchy and the clergy."
 AJAX.911.d:0 "The public position of the Shah deteriorated further following the holding of mass rallies against the Shah by the radical Fadaiyan-i-Islam group. The group, using its contacts among the clergy were able to rally supporters during the Friday prayers and bring them to the streets across the country. The protestors condemned the westernizing policies of the Pahlavi dynasty, its commitment to imperial powers, and what it called the oppression of Islam. The mobilization of the religious communities in Iran is a major blow to the Shah who is already facing public uproar over his autocratic tendencies and perceived status as an imperial stooge."
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After a brief siege, the Free Officers decided to mount an assault on the palace of King Farouk and secure the country. The King was guarded by approximately 800 well equipped Sudanese guardsmen. King Farouk, an expert marksman, participated in the defense, allegedly killing approximately 16 attackers as they entered the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. However, this left their forces vulnerable and they sustained heavy casualties. With the attackers weakened, King Farouk ordered a counterattack against the now disorganized and severely weakened Free Officer force. In the end, nearly thirty Free Officers surrendered but they were summarily executed. King Farouk declared a state of emergency and called on patriotic Egyptians to find Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the Free Officer leaders who escaped the counterattack. Analysts expect the King to purge nationalist in the Army and buildup the security apparatus."
 brown_v_board.2.d:0 "Chief Justice Earl Warren recently announced the verdict of the Supreme Court in the case of Brown vs Board of Education. The justices voted unanimously, nine to zero, that the racial segregation laws put in by mostly southern states, were unconstitutional. They noted segregation itself was inherently unequal, making the argument that separate schools but of equal quality to be moot. The court added that segregation laws violated the fourteenth amendment and all states should speedily end the practice as soon as possible. The case will likely cause shockwaves across the south where many white citizens are already condemning the decision of the court. For the Civil Rights movement this decision is a major victory as now black students will not be forced to attend lesser schools due to their race. The case began when black families in Kansas sued the local school board for forcing their children to attend a segregated school of lower quality and miles away from their homes."
 algeria.1002.d:0 "The war in Algeria took a dark turn following a failed FLN attack on Philippeville. The FLN launched a full-on assault, hoping to catch the French off-guard and seize the important port city. However, French forces had discovered the movement of FLN fighters and were aware of an attack. In the initial attack, French forces took casualties as European civilians along with Arabs and Berbers deemed collaborators were killed by the FLN and their local supporters. These killings and the attack were stopped after French paratroopers arrived, capturing over a hundred prisoners. French forces proceeded to execute their prisoners, killing at least two hundred. The local European civilian population reacted to their losses by launching a vicious pogrom of indiscriminate violence against the local Muslim population of Arabs and Berbers. As French forces looked on, hundreds of these civilians were killed in the local football stadium with European civilians watching from the stands. The horrific violence has enraged the Algerian Muslim population, outraged the international community, and has led to demands in Paris that the government consider its options."
 korea.48.d:0 "The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to pass resolution 82 in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea. The Soviet Union did not attend the meeting as they are boycotting the Security Council so could not veto. Of the present security council members, only Yugoslavia chose to abstain. The resolution condemns the North Korean invasion and call on member states to assist South Korea and refrain from arming or supporting North Korea. The United State and its allies are heralding the resolution as a major diplomatic victory and analysts believe it will pave the way for more direct American involvement in the conflict. For many member states, especially the United States and Western Europe, there is sympathy to the South Koreans as the memories of World War II and the surprise attacks by the Axis powers remain embedded in the collective memory of its leaders."
 iran_political.500.d:0 "A military court sentenced former Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh to death for his treasonous crimes against the government and people of Iran. Shortly after being sentenced, a firing squad carried out the sentence. Mossadegh was alleged to have made a statement that his actions were done for the liberty and honor of the Iranian people before being executed. Opponents of the late Prime Minister will no doubt rejoice over his death. His ability to rally popular support and political influence made him a potent threat to his opponents. For his supporters and allies, there will be great despair over his passing. However, rumors are already reaching Tehran that his network of political allies will likely try to continue his efforts for democratizing Iran and restoring its national honor."
