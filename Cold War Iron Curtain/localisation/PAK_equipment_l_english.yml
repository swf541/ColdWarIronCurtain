 PAK_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

 PAK_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The ZB-56 is an automatic assault rifle designed by the PRC in 1956 based off of the AK-47. It has seen combat in every war the PRC was involved in since its development. The ZB-56 has a number of differences from the AK-47. They were manufactured with a milled receiver and a fully enclosed sight. It's barrel is also heavier and is more similar to the barrel on the RPK with the exception that it lacks a reinforced trunnion. Additionally, it does not have a threaded muzzle. Because the ZB-56 has legendary reliability and is very easy to use, it continues to be used by armies all over the world. It is also marginally less expensive to manufacture than the AK-47."
