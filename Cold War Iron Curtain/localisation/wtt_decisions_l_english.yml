Whether it was the promise of unlimited food through agriculture, or the promise of unfettered locomotion offered by the wheel. Today's immense challenge of increasing energy use and industrial expansion at the cost of the environment was of dire need and consequence. As the economic want to consume and to comfort the desire of every human exceeded our planet's carrying capacity, the scientists of [Root.GetName] have after decades of research and hard work, after millions of man-hours and billions of dollars, have achieved a dream to power the World forever without taxing its dwindling resources or becoming beholden to the whims of Nature. The people of [Root.GetName] have rejoiced at their Nation's achievement of Nuclear Fusion! With the sharing of knowledge and expertise with the rest of the people of the World, it is indubitable that many Nations will soon follow in their footsteps. This National and International endeavor will deliver us to the day where our growth and that of the Planet are one. On the backs of cheap, affordable and ubiquitous energy."
