 MacArthur_Dismissal.1.d:0 "With the fighting intensifying in Korea, President Truman called on General MacArthur to express his concerns over reports of a major Chinese military buildup on the border. General MacArthur assured the President such a possibility is highly unlikely. He cited the lack of industrial base and military exhaustion from the civil war as just some of the reasons why China would not involve itself. President Truman accepted the advice and is more confident than ever in the leadership of MacArthur during this conflict."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.2.d:0 "President Truman has expressed his annoyance with General MacArthur after receiving news of the massive Chinese military intervention in Korea. He blames MacArthur for his cavalier military strategy and aggressive public statements. He feels these actions provoked the Chinese to act. General MacArthur is not to perturbed by this development and feels his forces are more than capable to meet the challenge. There are some reports in the media suggesting the President is not happy with the military situation in Korea."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.3.d:0 "As the war in Korea continues to grind on, General MacArthur is increasingly suggesting the conflict be expanded. He is linking the struggle against communism in Asia with Europe and believes the war should be expanded to target mainland Chinese targets and protect Taiwan. Some of these comments have found their way to the media and has led to editorials supporting the argument. President Truman is said to be infuriated by these developments. He does not agree with the assessment and wishes to keep the war limited to Korea. In particular, Truman is concerned with reports of UN naval forces being deployed towards Taiwan and the mainland coast. Above all else, Truman has expressed his fear that MacArthur is purposely leaking information to the media."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.4.d:0 "President Truman has demanded General MacArthur rein in his public comments and advocacy for a wider conflict. In particular, Truman wishes for MacArthur to avoid commenting or making decisions connected to foreign policy. Truman believes MacArthur is defying executive power and exercising power beyond his domain as a military commander. General MacArthur is said to be frustrated by the President and his apparent ego. Tensions are rising between the executive and military command in Korea."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.5.d:0 "General MacArthur wrote a communique for the senior officers under his command about launching offensive operations against China. MacArthur claims Chinese power is greatly exaggerated and the Korean conflict can be used to deal with the Chinese threat to Taiwan and its push to secure a seat at the Security Council. President Truman had planned on releasing a similar communique and is said to be furious with MacArthur. In particular, Truman is upset with the comments related to foreign policy. He and his advisors believe MacArthur is undermining the presidency and expanding his military command beyond acceptable realms."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.6.d:0 "President Truman has heard from several senior leaders in allied states who have expressed concern over General MacArthur. They say his worldview is contradictory to their own and they fear his judgement may cause the Korean conflict to explode into a global conflict. There are also concerns over his comments to the media as they are often inflammatory. Of more practical concern is his issuance of orders that at times almost contradicts from the policy agreed by political leaders. In one example, MacArthur authorized a major operation right before he received orders to not push on the front, even though he knew those orders were coming. President Truman has assured those leaders that General MacArthur will not dictate policy and the White House is in firm control of the situation."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.7.d:0 "President Truman was recently asked if he would order more offensives in Korea. The President stated such decisions were up to the commander on the ground. General MacArthur took this as permission and gave his commanders permission to conduct offensives on the ground, without consulting the White House. Upon hearing this news, President Truman was again agitated with MacArthur and believes he has once again overstepped his authority. President Truman has decided to call a meeting of his senior military leaders to discuss the future command of General MacArthur. MacArthur continuously issues orders and actions that are right on the boundary of acceptable and he clearly cannot follow the policy as dictated by the White House."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.8.d:0 "President Truman held a meeting with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and his top advisor to discuss the future of General MacArthur. Truman has grown concerned that MacArthur continuously operates independently from the White House and at times he has interfered in foreign policy during the Korean conflict. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary of Defense asked for a day to consider. After consulting the service heads, they concurred that a relief of MacArthur was desirable. With this information, President Truman has decided to finally relieve General MacArthur of command. President Truman asked if MacArthur could be relieved for insubordination, the Joint Chiefs advised against this as MacArthur could then ask for a court martial, instead they suggest he just be relieved. However, Truman is very tempted to call MacArthur out for insubordination to demonstrate executive authority and limit public criticism. The decision must be made."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.9.d:0 "The White House messaged the Army Secretary, currently visiting Korea, to inform General MacArthur that he would be relieved for his insubordination. However, there was an issue with the signals and the Army Secretary never received the message. Instead, Truman informed a reporter of his decision and MacArthur only found out when he heard the news from news reports in Tokyo. Upon hearing he was relieved for insubordination, General MacArthur was said to have reacted furiously and he has already publicly mentioned his intention to be tried in a court martial. In his comments with the media, President Truman stated he had no choice but to act as MacArthur was not controllable."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.10.d:0 "The White House messaged the Army Secretary, currently visiting Korea, to inform General MacArthur that he would be relieved. However, there was an issue with the signals and the Army Secretary never received the message. Instead, Truman informed a reporter of his decision and MacArthur only found out when he heard news reports in Tokyo about his dismissal. General MacArthur is said to be deeply hurt but is complying with his orders to hand over his command. In his press release, President Truman acknowledged the illustrious career of General MacArthur, but noted he was not wholly committed to the national policy and thus had to be replaced. The MacArthur family is making plans for a return back to the United States."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.11.d:0 "News that General MacArthur has been relieved of command has caused a lot of media backlash across the United States. Many editorials are criticizing President Truman for unceremoniously removing the most decorated officer in American history. Many reports note it was the leadership of MacArthur that turned the tide in Korea and his relief was due to what appears to be jealousy from the White House and not military conduct. To the millions of Americans who remember MacArthur for his wartime heroics or served under him during his over fifty years in the Army, his removal is being seen as a slap in the face. Only a few major newspapers supported the President by claiming MacArthur had overstepped his boundaries one too many times and the administration was left with only one choice."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.12.d:0 "Upon returning to the San Francisco from Korea, General MacArthur was met by senior military officers in the region and given a parade attended by half a million people. He was then invited to address a joint session in Congress. Upon landing in DC, senior military and government officials greeted him, however, President Truman slighted the General by not welcoming him. In his speech he denied an interest in partisanship and instead stated his only desire was and remains to serve his country. He denied claims he was a warmonger by stating few people have seen combat like he has, and his greatest desire remains preserving peace. During his address, he was interrupted more than fifty times with ovations. He defended his actions in Korea and lauded his post-war achievements with Japan. After the speech, many representatives and senators expressed their dismay that Truman would remove MacArthur, an officer of unprecedented achievement and class."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.13.d:0 "After addressing Congress, General MacArthur flew to New York City where he received the largest ticker-tape parade in the history of the city. Thousands came to see the old General and cheer him for all his achievements. After New York MacArthur visited Chicago where he addressed a packed Soldier Field with over 50,000 attendees. In all these visits he has defended his actions and highlighted his illustrious achievements. His ability to draw huge crowds from coast to coast is also being looked at by the Republican Party who plan on taking up his cause in the Senate. So far General MacArthur has denied rumors he intends to enter politics or join the party."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.14.d:0 "The Senate Armed Forces Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee are holding an inquiry into the war in the Far East and the decision to dismiss General MacArthur. Many Republican senators and representatives have criticized the President for his action. Senator Robert Taft called the decision vindictive and hasty, stating it proved how unfit President Truman was for the office. Along with the Joint Chiefs, General MacArthur will likely present evidence to the inquiry. The inquiry will decide if President Truman had violated his constitutional authority when he removed the General. The inquiry is a not just a major embarrassment for the President but also threatens to leave him vulnerable for an impeachment vote."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.15.d:0 "The Court Martial requested by General MacArthur to challenge allegations he was insubordinate has ruled in his favor. The military court found that in all incidents cited, he had not violated the military chain of command or carried out orders in contradiction to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They noted at times he came close, but upon a thorough examination, there was no direct evidence of this. This result is a major blow to President Truman who is currently facing a senate inquiry over his handling of the war in Korea and his decision to fire MacArthur. The court chose not to reinstate his command however, although it had the ability to do so."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.16.d:0 "The Senate investigation into the firing of General MacArthur reached its final conclusions. They concluded that President Truman had not breached constitutional authority by relieving MacArthur. However, they noted the circumstances it occurred hurt the national pride of the American people. The inquiry also claimed there was no evidence of major disagreements on military strategy between MacArthur and the Joint Chiefs. During the inquiry, General MacArthur provided powerful testimony defending himself, however, all his claims were rebutted by the Joint Chiefs, greatly weakening his arguments."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.17.d:0 "In a stunning development, the Senate inquiry into the decision of President Truman to relieve General MacArthur of command in Korea concluded that constitutional authority was breached by the President. The inquiry noted that General MacArthur had been relieved on false charges, as he was exonerated in the recent court martial, and that the President abused his authority to have him removed. During the inquiry, General MacArthur gave testimony which was countered by the Joint Chiefs, however, the inquiry noted the Joint Chiefs admitted they had not recommended MacArthur be removed has the President suggested to the press afterwards. The Joint Chiefs only stated they concurred with the decision. Republican representatives have brought articles of impeachment to the house floor."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.18.d:0 "The United States Congress is holding an extraordinary vote on whether to impeach President Harry Truman. If the vote passes, the articles of impeachment will go to the Senate who would try the President. If found guilty, the President will be removed from power. President Truman is being charged with abusing constitutional authority with his decision to relieve General MacArthur in Korea. Republicans are expected to vote for the articles and there are fears that even some Democrats may support the measure considering the public support for MacArthur along with Congressional disdain towards the President. Many still are upset he had not sought Congressional approval before intervening in Korea. In a statement the President stated his confidence that the trumped up accusations against him will not stand."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.19.d:0 "The United States Congress has voted to impeach the President of the United States. This is an unprecedented situation and the latest chapter in a constitutional crisis that has shaken the White House since President Truman decided to relieve General Douglas MacArthur from command in Korea. Many in Congress and in newspapers across the country applauded the vote, stating the vindictive nature of the President and his rash actions demonstrate his inability to lead in this crucial time for the United States. The White House has not issued any statements over the vote as many analysts believe they had been confident the measure would not receive enough votes. General MacArthur stated the vote is a victory for the democratic system."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.20.d:0 "The President of the United States, Harry Truman addressed the nation over the radio to announce his resignation from office. He will be the first sitting President to resign from office. Having recently been impeached by Congress, the President realized the Senate would likely find him guilty and remove him from power. In his address, the President stated he did not want to put the nation through anymore turmoil, especially considering the international situation. He added his decision was not an admission of guilt but a sacrifice for the greater good of the country. The Vice President, Alben W. Barkley will soon take the oath of President. The initial reaction to the speech is largely positive as political leaders and newspapers across the nation expressed admiration for the decision to end the crisis for the sake of national unity."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.21.d:0 "The United States Congress voted against impeaching President Harry Truman. This is a major victory for the embattled Command in Chief. He was facing charges of abusing constitutional authority over his decision to remove the highly decorated and popular General Douglas MacArthur from command in Korea. Although many Congressmen, especially Republicans expressed dismay over the result, it was clear during the process that the charges did not have enough merit to turn Congress against the President. Although President Truman has survived this ordeal, the negative attention and public ire over his decision will make his re-election chances much more challenging."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.22.d:0 "General Douglas MacArthur continues to make statements to the media and address audiences over his dismissal from command in Korea. Although he remains immensely popular due to his five decades of service in the military, his constant attacks on Truman are losing their power. Many Americans who saw MacArthur as a potential presidential candidate are losing interest as MacArthur does not appear to have a clear vision for the future of the country beyond his desire to see Truman lose."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.23.d:0 "Following the decision of Congress to impeach President Truman, General Douglas MacArthur has stepped up his public appearances and media interviews. Many Americans now view him as a victim of executive abuse and are rallying to his corner. Now that Truman has been removed, MacArthur is spending more time discussing his vision for America and its place in the world. His perspective of seeing communism more globally and connected to Asia is resonating among many American voters. There are even rumors he is holding talks with key Republican leaders over a potential Presidential run."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.24.d:0 "The Republican National Convention will soon convene to pick a candidate for President but has become deadlocked on who to endorse. Many in the party see the election as a golden opportunity to seize the presidency after decades of Democratic control. Republicans are divided between Senator Robert Taft and the legendary General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Key Republican leaders are now calling on General MacArthur to start campaigning for the endorsement to break the deadlock as his recent controversy with President Truman has made him a national figure all Republicans can support."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.25.d:0 "Upon careful reflection, General Douglas MacArthur has decided to openly seek the nomination for Presidency from the Republican Party. His decision to join the race has broken the deadlock for the nomination and many in the party were quick to support the General. MacArthur himself stated that as a military man he long rejected involving himself in politics, however, considering the state of the nation, he would be doing a disservice by not answering the call. The Democratic Party is said to be greatly concerned, especially as General MacArthur is currently riding high following the impeachment and resignation of his nemesis, President Truman."
 MacArthur_Dismissal.26.d:0 "General MacArthur informed Republican leaders that he would not actively campaign for the nomination for President. Though if given to him he would consider it. For many Republicans who support the General this is a major setback and hinderance. It is now very unlikely that he will receive the nomination and the party will have to break its deadlock and decide between Senator Robert Taft and General Dwight D. Eisenhower. General MacArthur has privately indicated that when the time comes he will endorse Taft. It appears General MacArthur will now quietly enjoy his retirement at the Waldorf Towers."
 usanews.3.d:0 "At [GetDateText] the worst accident in the history of the U.S. nuclear power industry began when a pressure valve in the Unit-2 reactor at Three Mile Island failed to close. Cooling water, contaminated with radiation, drained from the open valve into adjoining buildings, and the core began to dangerously overheat. After the cooling water began to drain out of the broken pressure valve, emergency cooling pumps automatically went into operation. However, human operators in the control room misread confusing and contradictory readings and shut off the emergency water system. The reactor was also shut down, but residual heat from the fission process was still being released.\n Shortly after 8 a.m., word of the accident leaked to the outside world. The plant's parent company, Metropolitan Edison, downplayed the crisis and claimed that no radiation had been detected off plant grounds, but the same day inspectors detected slightly increased levels of radiation nearby as a result of the contaminated water leak. Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh considered calling an evacuation. Finally, at about 8 p.m., plant operators realized they needed to get water moving through the core again and restarted the pumps. The temperature began to drop, and pressure in the reactor was reduced. The reactor had come within less than an hour of a complete meltdown. More than half the core was destroyed or molten.\nTwo days later, however, a bubble of highly flammable hydrogen gas was discovered within the reactor building. After the radiation leak was discovered, residents were advised to stay indoors. Experts were uncertain if the hydrogen bubble would create further meltdown or possibly a giant explosion, and as a precaution Governor Thornburgh advised \"pregnant women and pre-school age children to leave the area within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility until further notice.\" This led to the panic the governor had hoped to avoid; within days, more than 100,000 people had fled surrounding towns. Slowly, the hydrogen was bled from the system as the reactor cooled and few days later, the whole ordeal was over."
 usanews.4.d:0 "Three Mile Island Unit 2 near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA has suffered a severe accident. Through the failure of an important valve to operate correctly, cooling water to the core was lost, parts of the core were melted and the rest of it destroyed, and a large quantity of fission products was released from the primary reactor system to the interior of the containment structure. The equipment failure was exacerbated by reactor operator error, as the emergency core cooling system was deactivated by operator action because of a misinterpretation of the type of accident that was occurring.\nThe plant's parent company downplayed the crisis and claimed that no radiation had been detected off plant grounds, but the same day inspectors detected slightly increased levels of radiation nearby.\nAt the height of the crisis, plant workers were exposed to unhealthy levels of radiation, but no one outside Three Mile Island had their health adversely affected by the accident. Nonetheless, the incident greatly eroded the public's faith in nuclear power."
