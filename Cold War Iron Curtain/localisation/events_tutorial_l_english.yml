 tutorial.11.t:0 "DEFCON Menu"
 tutorial.11.d:0 "DEFCON is a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. DEFCON now affects how you declare war or how to interact militarily with other countries."
 tutorial.12.t:0 "DEFCON V"
 tutorial.12.d:0 "First, we have DEFCON 5. This means peacetime and has the lowest amount of war action you can do. DEFCON 5 is already selected for you and it already affects what you can do militarily. You will not be able to declare war at all until you either reach 50% world tension or get an event that gets war declared on you or you declaring war on a country. An example would be the Korean War happening and the US being called in. This would unlock DEFCON 3 for use. Proxy wars are more important now as you can't fully declare war, but you can still send land-lease or send volunteers."
 
 tutorial.13.t:0 "DEFCON IV"
 tutorial.13.d:0 "DEFCON 4 is unlocked when there is more than 25% world tension. You can send more volunteers and lend lease to your proxy wars. You can also influence countries more and more with each DEFCON."
 tutorial.14.t:0 "DEFCON III"
 tutorial.14.d:0 "DEFCON 3 is when things start getting serious. You can only activate DEFCON 3 while at war (not a World War, but a proxy war for example. You must have more than 50% world tension. With DEFCON 3 you can now send more and more lend lease and volunteers, but you can now declare your own wars. With DEFCON 2, you need 75% or more World Tension."
 tutorial.15.t:0 "DEFCON II"
 tutorial.15.d:0 "DEFCON 2 can let you send a lot more volunteers and lend lease, and also makes CBs and wars even cheaper. DEFCON 1 requires more than 95% world tension to unlock."
 tutorial.16.t:0 "DEFCON I"
 tutorial.16.d:0 "DEFCON 1 can let you send the max amount of volunteers and lend lease, while declaring your own wars even cheaper. This causes total war and likely ends the world for you as World War III will break out."
 tutorial.17.t:0 "DEFCON: Conclusion"
 tutorial.17.d:0 "Theses are the steps on how it works and we hope this tutorial helps you with it, now go play Global Thermonuclear War!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"
 
 tutorial.22.t:0 "Nuclear Missiles"
 tutorial.22.d:0 "'Nuclear missiles' is a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. There are 2 types of nuclear bombs: Atomic Fission (Atomic Bombs) and Atomic Fusion (Hydrogen Bombs) and 4 types for nuclear missiles: Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM), Short-Ranged Ballistic Missile (SRBM), Intermediate-Ranged Ballistic Missile (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)."
 tutorial.23.t:0 "Nuclear Missiles II"
 tutorial.23.d:0 "SLBMs can be launched from anywhere in the world from ballistic submarines. SRBMs are short range missiles and only have a few hundred kilometers of range. (Example: West Germany to Western Poland). IRBMs range from several hundred kilometers to a couple thousand. (Example: Eastern France to Moscow). ICBMs can virtually hit anything around the world. (Example: Eastern US to West Russia). Here is how to build and work with Nuclear Missiles:"
 tutorial.24.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 1."
 tutorial.24.d:0 "Step 1. Once you open the research tab you will see the tab at the far end. The radioactive symbol is the WMD tree tab. Click it and it will take you to the WMD tree."
 tutorial.25.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 2."
 tutorial.25.d:0 "Step 2. Once you get on the WMD tab you will see all of the missiles and bombs. Now click to research a missile or bomb. For this we will use a missile."
 tutorial.26.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 3."
 tutorial.26.d:0 "Step 3. Once you research a missile, you go go to the production tab. Once there, all missiles and bombs are classified under planes. Once you do that you then build the missile you want."
 tutorial.27.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 4."
 tutorial.27.d:0 "Step 4. After missiles finish being built, you then need to find where they are. They will spawn at airfields and you can position them at airfields wherever you want. You create a new air wing and they will form."
 tutorial.28.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 5."
 tutorial.28.d:0 "Step 5. Now once you placed them at a airfield you can hover over the airfield and see the missile's range. That is as far they can go. If you want a bigger range, research a later tech class of them or research a bigger missile with a bigger range."
 tutorial.29.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 6 (SLBM)."
 tutorial.29.d:0 "(Optional/Only for SLBMs) Step 6. For SRBMs they act like naval planes for aircraft carriers. You have to build a new class of submarine. This class is Ballistic Submarine. Then you do what you regularly do for planes on aircraft carriers and add them there."
 tutorial.30.t:0 "Nuclear Missile: Step 7."
 tutorial.30.d:0 "Step 7. Once you do these steps you are now available to do global thermonuclear war. To do this just click on a province and the vanilla nuclear button will be there. That will send the missile to the province and KABOOM, a nuclear blast goes off and nuclear war begins."
 tutorial.31.t:0 "Nuclear Missile Conclusion"
 tutorial.31.d:0 "Those are the steps on how they work; we hope this tutorial helped you, now go cause Armageddon on the world!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"
 
 tutorial.33.t:0 "Helicopters"
 tutorial.33.d:0 "Helicopters are a new mechanic introduced to our mod, and can be confusing to understand. There is 4 types of helicopters: Cargo, Utility, Attack, Light Attack/Scout, and ASW."
 
 tutorial.34.t:0 "Cargo"
 tutorial.34.d:0 "Cargo deals with supply transport and making sure your troops are supplied."
 
 tutorial.35.t:0 "Utility"
 tutorial.35.d:0 "Utility deals with transporting troops over short distances and move fast and deal a bit of damage due to door guns and gun pods on them. Utility will also make up a new Air Cavalry Division template."
 
 tutorial.36.t:0 "Attack"
 tutorial.36.d:0 "Attack helicopters attack ground units and deal some damage to air units. Attack helicopters are also part of division templates and will give buffs to attack."
 
 tutorial.37.t:0 "Light Attack/Scout"
 tutorial.37.d:0 "Light Attack/Scout mostly deal with recon but can deal some light damage to ground units. Scout helicopters are really fast due to them being light."
 
 tutorial.38.t:0 "Anti Submarine Warfare"
 tutorial.38.d:0 "ASW deals with attacking naval ships or submarines and is the only helicopter that could attack naval units. ASW helicopters attach to Helicopter Carriers and regular Carriers, though you can't fit a lot on regular carriers."
 tutorial.39.t:0 "Helicopters II"
 tutorial.39.d:0 "helicopters may be fast and cheaper to produce, they are easier to take out due to them not being as fast as planes. So choose wisely on what you would want to do."
 tutorial.40.t:0 "Helicopters Conclusion"
 tutorial.40.d:0 "Those are the steps on how it works and we hope this tutorial helps you, now go play Fortune Son in a helicopter!\n\n\n-From the Cold War: Iron Curtain Dev Team"

 tutorial.44.t:0 "NATO"
 tutorial.44.d:0 "NATO is now a defensive alliance since update 3.10. This means that it does not show up on the faction screen and can only be seen through the idea assigned to a country. When one of them gets attacked, the other get the option to join. Their acceptance depends on the strongness/weakness of the enemy country."

 tutorial.55.t:0 "Chemical Weapons"
 tutorial.55.d:0 "Chemical weapons are abilities that can be unlocked through the their research in the WMD Tech tab. You need to produce 50 units of one weapon to be able to use the ability with your commander.\n\nThis requires the Waking the Tiger DLC."

 tutorial.211.d:0 "Cold War Iron Curtain introduces a brand new WMD system, allowing for more complicated and strategic nuclear exchanges over the standard vanilla click every province method. There are 8 basic parts to the GUI. \n 1. The top left screen shows the nuclear powers of the world- in other words, who has armed their stockpile through the political tab policy. \n 2. The Defcon screen shows your Defcon level, and is only available to the USA, USSR, and PRC. Moving the level down will indicate a higher stage of tension.\n \n 3. The middle section of the GUI shows how many of each kind of WMD you have, from vanilla nukes to ICBMs. The Chemical Weapons list on the far right is a WIP, and the denuclearize bit- well, why would you want to do that, anyway? \n 4. Underneath the section discussed in 3 are 3 options, for a level 1, 2, or 3 strike, each offering different amounts of nukes used and different targets. Level 1 is a basic attack on enemy capitals in range. Level 2 is level 1, plus extra nukes for strategic targets, ie. large population or industrial centers. Level 3 is a full, all out, nuclear broadside, and requires one of 2 things- ICBM technology, or for the USSR or USA, missiles in Cuba or Turkey, respectively. \n 5. The big greyed out nuclear button will turn red if all requirements for launch are met, and then you get to play global thermonuclear warfare. \n 6. Underneath the big button is a list of nukes required for the strike. \n 7. To the left of that is a State target list for the strike. \n 8. To the left of that is a list of enemy countries in range of your missiles. \n\n Remember, if you experience any bugs or problems with this system, don't hesitate to list them on steam or discord. \n\n Happy Bombing!"

 TUTOR.666.t:0 "§RDO NOT PLAY AS THE VATICAN§!"
 TUTOR.666.d:0 "§RThe Vatican is intended as a global hub to launch decisions and control the game behind the scenes. Playing as the Vatican will cause crashes, errors, bugs, and generally just not make the game run at all.§!"
 TUTOR.666.a:0 "Ok, damn, calm down. I'll restart the game because I already ruined it."
