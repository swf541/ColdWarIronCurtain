 chemistry_III:0 "Stereoselective Oxidation Reactions"
 chemistry_III_desc:0 "Stereochemistry is a section of organic chemistry that deals with stereoconfigurations in a molecule. Stereoconfigurations are the specific ways in which completely different sections in a joint of a molecule are arranged. Different configurations of the same molecule have the same molecular structure and components but completely different shapes as a result of different orders in which complex joins are placed."
 chemistry_IV:0 "Fullerenes and Theoretical Nanomaterials"
 chemistry_IV_desc:0 "The fullerene is a macromolecule composed of carbon atoms forming a hollow cage. Fullerenes are used as drug delivery systems in the body, as lubricants, or as catalysts.\nNanomaterials are highly advanced materials that would theoretically need to be manufactured using nanotechnology. Without access to nanotechnology, these materials would need to be manufactured at an extreme cost but still have rare applications in supercomputers, science, or extremely advanced high-tech goods." 
 chemistry_V:0 "Carbon Nanotubes"
 chemistry_V_desc:0 "Carbon nanotubes such as Graphene are tubules of carbon atoms that form macromolecules similar to fullerenes but in tube form instead of spherical hollow cages. Graphene is amongst the strongest materials known to man but also very difficult to produce en mass. They are used in highly advanced computers, military technology, and cutting-edge industrial processes in small amounts to fill jobs that cannot be filled by any other material."

 #Materials 
 materials_I:0 "Titanium Alloys"
 materials_I_desc:0 "Titanium Alloys are metallurgical mixtures of titanium and other allows. They have high tensile strengths and extreme corrosive and weather resistance. Titanium in itself, although strong, is a brittle metal. With the addition of other metals, such as vanadium or aluminum, it can retain much of its strength but also gain ductility. Although infeasible for construction or supporting structures, it is used in aircraft, spacecraft, medical devices, in vehicles, and consumer electronics."
 materials_II:0 "Float Glass"
 materials_II_desc:0 "Float glass is a form of glass created by floating molten glass on molten metals such as tin. This gives it uniform thickness. The uniformity makes it better for commercial and industrial uses in optics and most forms of construction. Virtually all glass used in the modern era is float glass because it is inexpensive to make as it is simply soda-lime glass formed on small quantities of molten, cheap metals with low melting points such as tin. Additionally, float glass can be processed further to create reinforced or frosted glass."

 #civil engineering
 civil_engineering_I:0 "Advancement of Prestressed Concrete"
 civil_engineering_I_desc:0 "Concrete has always had trouble dealing with the large loads and tensions of modern construction projects. As such, it was eventually reinforced. However, there are still many projects that were still too demanding for concrete to handle. Prestressed concrete was developed to allow concrete to be reinforced even more. In prestressed concrete, high-strength steel tendons are stressed [or ‘compressed’] and the concrete itself is laid over this to form premade stressed concrete sections."
 civil_engineering_II:0 "Basic Fine Elements Method"
 civil_engineering_II_desc:0 "The Fine Elements Method [FEM] is a mathematical method of solving engineering and physics problems in areas of interest such as structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic potential. In order to solve problems through the FEM, large problems are divided into small problems known as “finite elements”. By dividing large engineering problems in this manner, they can be solved faster and at a more precise level and identify specific fine problem areas."
 civil_engineering_III:0 "Sequential Excavation Method"
 civil_engineering_III_desc:0 "Sequential Excavation Method [SEM] is a method of creating and designing tunnels. The geological strength of the stone is used as much as possible to reduce costs. By controlling the deformation of the ground as it is tunneled and having support be load-deforming, the natural strength of the stone is utilized to the best of its ability. The tunnel is sequentially excavated and supported with each problem analyzed along the way to allow for adaptation to rock conditions as they change."
 civil_engineering_IV:0 "Modern Sctructural Theories"
 civil_engineering_IV_desc:0 "As structures become more complex, the core concepts behind solving engineering problems needs to improve. With the advent of modern structural theories that simplify calculations such as the Shell Membrane Theory which states that thin cylindrical shells have negligible mechanical motion and new formulas to calculate membrane and shear forces more effectively, more engineering problems can be addressed in a shorter amount of time."
 civil_engineering_V:0 "Stone Mastic Asphalt"
 civil_engineering_V_desc:0 "Stone Mastic Asphalt is a form of pavement which is deformation-resistant and highly durable. SMA is made up of aggregate content that forms an internal stone skeleton. The stone skeleton itself is made of asphalt, general filler such as plastics, rubber, and adhesives, and fibres. The stone skeleton provides more stone-on-stone contact that conventional asphalts resulting in higher binder durability and less air voids."
 civil_engineering_VI:0 "Bundle Tube Structural System"
 civil_engineering_VI_desc:0 "The Bundle Tube Structural System, also known as a Generation 4 or “type 4” tower structural system. is a method of constructing large towers in in columns. Some columns are shorter than other and placed further from each-other and help to support larger columns within’ the same tower. This helps skyscrapers to become stronger and resist lateral forces. This also allows towers to take on different shapes other than boxes to be efficient economically and structurally, making cities less ugly." 
 civil_engineering_VII:0 "Advanced Computation Analysis"
 civil_engineering_VII_desc:0 "With more and more complex structures and systems, engineering problems are becoming increasingly complex. Even with simplifiers such as improved membrane and structural theories, the bundle tube system, fine elements, and other methods which make construction more modular and easy to process, the needs of the modern world grow more complex. Eventually problems become too tedious for engineers to solve without aid."
 civil_engineering_VIII:0 "High Quality Structural Steel"
 civil_engineering_VIII_desc:0 "Oxygen Steelmaking creates higher quality structural steel than former methods.Oxygen furnaces blow large quantities of pure oxygen into molten iron and scrapped steel and completes its charge more quickly than open-hearth methods.Up to 350 metric tons of iron and scrap steel can be converted to high quality steel in less than an hour. Additionally, this reduces the cost of steel greatly and makes the system more sustainable by reducing airborne waste and making the system more energy efficient"
 civil_engineering_IX:0 "Slipform Paving"
 civil_engineering_IX_desc:0 "Slipform paving is a method by which roads are paved continuously. Using modern placer/spreader vehicles, the PCC or asphalt mass is pulled continuously to ensure a more consistent design that is produced faster. Afterwards, the paver screeds excesses and smooths the structure and potentially, places reinforcements as it moves.\nBy doing this, road maintenance can be performed more quickly and thin pavements can be made at a greater rate."
 civil_engineering_X:0 "Large Scale CAD Use"
 civil_engineering_X_desc:0 "When computation tools were first developed, their potential and capability was quickly shown. The development of modern Computer Assisted Design tools and their large scale adoption leads to a massive advancement in the efficiency of architectural and engineering design.

 #excavation
 excavation_I:0 "Large Scale Quarry Extraction"
 excavation_I_desc:0 "Around the 1950s, new methods of extraction and equipment were developed to allow large quarry pits to gather stone or gravel. Modern crawler vehicles and stripping equipment was created specifically to allow mass extractions and modular pit sizes. Creating modular tiers that are planned to allow equipment to travel up and down pits at relatively fast rates with standardized slopes and internal logistics systems and relays enable larger pits to remain efficient."
 excavation_II:0 "Bucket Wheel Extractors"
 excavation_II_desc:0 "Bucket wheel extractors are pieces of heavy surface mining equipment that add multiple extractor buckets to a wheel that deposit their loads onto a track as they dig. These extractors continuously scoop material as the wheel turns and are able to carve out vertical sections in a pit. They are highly efficient at harvesting or removing loose material.\nTo date, Bucket Wheel Extractors are the heaviest land vehicles ever made."
 excavation_III:0 "Mountain Top Removal Mining"
 excavation_III_desc:0 "Mountaintop Removal Mining is a method of surface mining at the summit or ridge of a mountain. By removing overburden from a summit or ridge, a large enough level space is created that can be mined downward. Over time, more overburden is removed from the edges of the seams to allow deeper pits from the tops of mountains. This method enables the open pit extraction of rich resources that have been brought up by the seismic formation of mountains without needing to create deep shafts in order to mine them."
 excavation_IV:0 "Landfill Reclamation"
 excavation_IV_desc:0 "Landfill reclamation is the process of gathering waste from a waste landfill for the purpose of processing. Recyclable wastes or scrap is gathered then is shipped off to be sorted and extracted for anything valuable. Metallic wastes can be reforged, plastics can be reprocessed, and anything else that has not degraded can potentially be recycled. Additionally, it aerates the landfill which can help with the degradation of whatever is left behind, aiding in the ecological reclamation of the landfill site in the future assuming toxic materials are also separated from the landfill."
 excavation_V:0 "Transnational Mining Corporations"
 excavation_V_desc:0 "Transnational Mining Corporations are massive conglomerate corporations that seek foreign investment into sites where the local population cannot afford to begin resource gathering operations. TMCs gather greater amounts of resources by investing in large amounts of equipment and manpower to the point of saturation for a resource gathering operation rather than relying on the local expansion of an RGO."

 agriculture_I_desc:0 "Chelation is the binding of organic ions and molecules to metal ions. It involves multiple coordinate bonds between a ligand and a central metal atom. Chelates are very useful for providing nutritional supplements. In agriculture, chelates are used to make complex fertilizers and deliver important micronutrients to the plants to improve their health and nutrition. This greatly improves agricultural output as previous fertilizers failed to provide metallic micronutrients to plants."
 agriculture_II:0 "Widespread Pesticide Adoption"
 agriculture_II_desc:0 "\n\nPests have frequently caused problems for farmers as they consume the crops. Various methods have been taken up to reduce pest problems such as fencing or usage of aromatic repellants. However, these have failed to stop all pests.\nBy adopting poisons that have little effect on humans but are lethal to insect pests and introducing them at a large scale, many insect colonies living near farms can be culled.\n\n§R This is a much better alternative to napalming the wilderness, but has been criticized as nowhere near as badass."
 agriculture_III:0 "No Tileage Agriculture"
 agriculture_III_desc:0 "No-till farming is a sustainable farming method in which the soil is not disrupted or upturned by tillage. This greatly reduces soil erosion and improves the lifespan of the soil. However, several practices must be adopted in this method. Cover crops must control weeds and the fields themselves must be rotated. Sod drainways must be installed to prevent gullies, water-worn ravines, from growing. Farming equipment must conduct direct-drill planting. Excess residue must be removed regularly."

 logistics_IV_A:0 "Consumption-based MRP"
 logistics_IV_A_desc:0 "Consumption-based Manufacturing Resource Planning plans using current and future sales figures in order to manufacture potentially needed products ahead of time, saving time and meeting the demand quickly. However, there are inaccuracies in Consumption-based MRP which leads to waste based on inaccurate projections, which can cost resources and lead to waste. Sometimes, Consumption-based MRP has catastrophic projections failings which lead to liquidations or mass waste."
 logistics_IV_B:0 "Produce to Demand MRP"
 logistics_IV_B_desc:0 "Produce-to-Demand Manufacturing Resource Planning plans based on immediate needs and does not build the product until it is ordered. By doing this, waste is prevented and resources and active factory time are saved. This, however, results in waiting times and puts more pressure on commerce to plan on an individual level for their own products or rely more heavily on customer ahead-of-time ordering. Produce-to-demand can often lead to shortages or order backlogs but prevents resource waste."
 logistics_V_A:0 "Truck-based Container Standardization"

 management_II:0 "Preventive Maintenance" 
 management_II_desc:0 "Preventative maintenance is a core aspect of TPM in which maintenance and inspections are conducted ahead of time before a breakdown occurs. Through systematic inspection, detection, and correction of failures during non-productive hours work is carried out to avoid breakdown or malfunction. The development of PM requires the development of a regime, special maintenance teams and tools, and a training system in order to enable maintainers to detect potential failures or wearing ahead of time."
 management_III_A:0 "Periodic Maintenance"
 management_III_A_desc:0 "Periodic maintenance is a reduction of the TPM regimen scheduled based on the estimated lifespan of machines or parts. Based off of trends, inspections are planned and conducted periodically and is not as extensive as predictive maintenance, as it results in less frequent inspections. Periodic maintenance reduces overall costs, but has less productivity and more common failures due to the less intensive and regular maintenances."
 management_III_B:0 "Predictive Maintenance"
 management_III_B_desc:0 "Predictive maintenance is an expansion of the TPM regimen scheduled based on the condition of equipment. Predictive maintenance is an expansion of inspections conducted regularly on machinery and maintains equipment whenever it shows signs of wear, fatigue, or potential failure. Predictive maintenance is more expensive as it requires an expansion of the TPM regimen, but is more effective at preventing failures and maintaining productivity."
 management_IV:0 "Cellular Manufacturing"

By developing powder coating, metal equipment and products can be more protected against rusting and abrasion far better than they could be with traditional paints."
 production_efficiency_II:0 "Half-Twist Conveyor Belt"
 production_efficiency_II_desc:0 "The half-twist is a method of creating a mobius (1 surfaced 3d object) conveyor by half-twisting one end. This results in conveyor belts lasting much longer because the entire surface area of the belt is worn continuously instead of one side being used in a nontwisted belt. This prevents accidents, breaks, and reduces the amount of accidents and replacements needed in conveyor belts, making production more streamlined and improving the manufacturing process."

Assisting manufacturing using CAM software greatly aids management, manufacturing, and storage and allows the computer system to quickly adjust itself to fit a multitude of different specifications. The precision of CAM allows for greater flexibility in changing production, higher precision for higher quality products, and reduced waste by only using the required amount of material and even reducing energy consumption."
 production_efficiency_VII:0 "Computer-Integrated Manufacturing"
 production_efficiency_VII_desc:0 "Fully integrated computer manufacturing is the extension of computer-aided manufacturing. Fully integrated systems measure, record, and control every section of a manufacturing operation. With this level of control, an entire manufacturing process can be operated and streamlined with regards to every other section in a production line."
 production_efficiency_VIII:0 "Advanced Laser Engraving"
 production_efficiency_VIII_desc:0 "Laser engraving is the usage of lasers to mark an object or leave a laser impression. While laser marking and laser engraving have been used before, developing the technology to mark metal objects with serial numbers or data enables better management of logistics and allows for more permanence than paint or powder marking. Additionally, lasers do not wear out as they do not use tool bits that make contact with the engraving surface."
 production_efficiency_IX:0 "Cold Spraying Coating"
 production_efficiency_IX_desc:0 "Cold spraying is a coating method in which supersonic gas jets spray a surface and impact, leading to adhesion on the surface. This method of coating is much faster than previous methods and enables surfaces of products or machine parts to be manufactured quicker and simpler. It also is more energy efficiency and it can also collect and reuse particles that miss as well as improving overall safety in the workplace."
 production_efficiency_X:0 "Basic 3D Printing"
 production_efficiency_X_desc:0 "3D printing is the process by which liquid or powder materials are solidified to form a solid object. This is primarily used industrially to create thermoset polymer models and create plastic objects. This method is more efficient and less wasteful than plastic molding and can be especially useful in creating medical objects such as implants or replacement tooth crowns."
