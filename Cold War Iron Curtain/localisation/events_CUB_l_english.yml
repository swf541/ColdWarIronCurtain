 Cubatourism.1:0 "Thanks to its location Cuba has long been a popular attraction for tourists from its neighboring nations, playing host to more tourists in the start of the 20th century than any other location in the Caribbean. While this booming industry was severely hampered by the Great Depression and the second World War, tourism on the small island is thriving once again as people flock to relieve stress and enjoy the serenity of the island. Not all is serene on the island though as social tensions mount behind the scenes, with the island's own native population growing increasingly restless with the ever more corrupt and authoritarian government."
 
 CubaRepression.2:0 "The Cuban government is mulling whether to invite Meyer Lansky to Havana. Lansky is a notorious figure with strong ties with the American mob. Over the past couple decades, he has played a major role in guiding mafia activity in Havana, bringing millions in investments. The Cuban government hopes that by bringing him they can negotiate an arrangement to secure profitable hotels and casinos, along with a heavy influx of cash investments. The Cuban government can make Lansky an offer that will guarantee profits in exchange for payoffs to the government to ensure Cuba will have a sizable reserve of cash in case of an emergency. Doing such a deal will offer a lot of potential profit and development, but the risk of having a large organized crime presence from America will alienate Cubans and potentially the United States government. In addition, the impact these investors will have on Cuban politics must also be considered because if they feel threatened, the mafia might resort to bribery or violence against Cuban officials, which can only enflame opposition towards the government."
 CubaRepression.4.d:0 "In the pursuit for creating the largest casino outside of Las Vegas an American businessman named Meyer Lansky has ordered for the construction of a grand casino in our capital of Havana! With hundreds of rooms planned, and each one even being air conditioned! This will surely attract more tourists and prove beneficial in making Cuba the home away from home for every visitor. May the Riviera of the Caribbean shine!"
 CubaRepression.5:0 "President Fulgencio Batista and his Progressive Action Party swept the polls during the 1954 elections in Cuba. Batista unified three Cuban parties and during the electoral campaign many opposition candidates dropped out of the race. Opposition leaders, including former presidents claimed their followers were terrorized by the Batista regime. Certain parties participated in exchange for guarantees from the Batista regime, but most opposition parties boycotted the result. Less than fifty percent of the electorate participated, indicating the boycott was effective. The election was meant to legitimize Batista following his return to power through a military coup, but this appears to have backfired. The election results have turned those who oppose Batista but did not support the revolutionaries waging armed resistance from the mountains to now begin to be more sympathetic to the revolutionary rebels. The election had failed in legitimizing his regime and now even neutral Cubans view the Batista regime as more of a dictatorship."
 CubaRepression.6:0 "President Fulgencio Batista, the Cuban President, defeated a coup attempt launched by hundreds of military officers led by Colonel Ramon Barquin. Colonel Barquin, a professional officer, was said to be distraught by Batista shifting Cuba from a democracy to a dictator. He convinced a number of likeminded officers to join his cause but was unable to overthrow Batista. President Batista was able to rally support among enlisted personnel but the United States explicit backing for Batista convinced many not to join the coup. Colonel Barquin was captured and is currently awaiting a court martial along with his co-conspirators. Although President Batista has survived, his officer corps, especially his professional officers, are now purged and there are fears anti-Batista rebel forces may take advantage of the situation. The attempt indicates that as Batista solidifies his control, he increasingly pushes his opposition to more dramatic acts. Although the coup has been broken with many detained, President Batista is expected to expand the purge of the army and uproot professional officers who may share the vision of Colonel Barquin."
 CubaRepression.7:0 "President Fugencio Batista of Cuba announced he would be suspending the Cuban constitution of 1940. President Batista made the move to consolidate his rule and by suspending the constitution he has ended many of its progressive guarantees. This will allow his regime to more freely crackdown on an increasingly vocal opposition. In addition, elite Cuban landowners and businessmen welcome the ending of certain rights to workers which they long argued hindered their profits. However, while Batista may attract more elite support, both peasants and workers are said to be very unhappy and fear a rollback of their rights. In addition, this action further strengthens the argument by detractors of Batista, who point out this action proves their belief the military coup which returned Batista to power only occurred to satisfy his own political agenda. Many more now agree the coup had been launched not to save the country but to save Batista from political defeat in the upcoming elections."
 CubaSterling.2.d:0 "President Sterling continued his efforts to resolve the crisis in Cuba by announcing a major new policy. He has offered the Cuban revolutionary rebels, many operating in the mountains, a general amnesty. All rebels who wish to end their conflict can move to any government police or military post, surrender their arms, pledge to not rebel in the future, and then return home. President Sterling hopes this mass amnesty will weaken the resolve and thin the ranks of the rebels by offering those who are no longer as committed to the cause a way out without fear of government retaliation. The action will also demonstrate the willingness of President Sterling to engage in a reasonable way to all parties. Certainly, there are elements, particularly among the more rabid anti-communists in the government camp who are not fans of the amnesty and fear rebels may just spread across Cuba or just return to war after they resolve issues at home. However, there is a sense of optimism in Havana with this new approach."
 CubaAguero.1.d:0 "President Andres Aguero of Cuba formally asked the United States to intervene and end the ongoing turmoil plaguing the island nation. Cuban revolutionaries, operating in the mountains along with their urban sympathizers have been waging a brutal offensive against the Cuban government. President Aguero made his request to the United States Ambassador in Havana and added a failure by the Americans to not intervene will leave his nation vulnerable to the radical communists leading the unrest. The President added that in addition to the ideological threat the rebels pose, Cuba has long been a favored destination for American visitors along with American investments. The fall of the Cuban democratic system could see many Americans lose businesses and investments. President Aguero hopes that the United States will be convinced, and his beleaguered government can utilize the support of its powerful neighbor to the north to turn the tide against revolutionary forces which appear to be growing almost daily."

 CubaSterling.1.d:0 "The United States ambassador to Cuba arrived at the White House with an important message from President Sterling, the leader of Cuba. President Sterling urgently conveyed in a letter for the President his need for the United States to act as a mediator to resolve the current political unrest sweeping his country. Many Cubans have grown frustrated with the flawed democratic system which appears to empower elite Cubans at the expense of the working man. In addition, members among the elite, including foreign investors are said to be frustrated with the presidential policy platform of Sterling. President Sterling faces a threat from both revolutionaries advocating a change of governmental system and the fear of either a military or political coup to oust him and push Cuba deeper towards a path of dictatorship. He hopes if the United States agree to act as a mediator, he will be able to negotiate and resolve the problems facing Cuba from both a position of strength and legitimacy."
 CubaRepression.10.d:0 "With the security situation deteriorating by the day, the Cuban government announced it would delay the upcoming elections. The revolutionary rebels in recent weeks called for a general strike, stepped up attacks, and engaged in an urban bombing campaign to try and prevent the elections. President Batista decided it would be best to delay the elections but promised they would be held as Cuba would not be blackmailed by communist thugs. The decision to delay the election has led to more disappointment with the Batista regime as many Cubans now increasingly believe the democratic system has now completely been transformed into a Batista dictatorship. The rebels are also said to be elated that their ability to mobilize urban populations and the general public has increased to such a capacity. The Cuban military is said to be stepping up its own operations in order to ensure the delay for elections is not postponed further as the Batista regime needs the elections to prove its constitutional credentials to a population increasingly skeptical about whether Cuba even has a constitutional law anymore."

 M267_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "One of our Special Domestic Agents has successfully infiltrated the M267 and the informational gain is incredible. We have gained an unprecedented amount of data and a network of confidential informants who will aid our fight against the Cuban insurgency. Already, our network has discovered countless supply depots and is capable of dismantling countless operations, severely weakening the capability of the M267 to do damage against our nation.\nThis success will have profoundly positive implications and protect our nation."
 M267_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "Following the failure of our Special Domestic Agent's attempt to infiltrate the M267, the M267 has patched several vulnerable points in their operations, improved their vetting process, and become more resilient as a whole. Additionally, although our agent resisted interrogation, they were able to learn more about us from his actions and in the coming days, may attempt to use these techniques against lower level targets such as police stations and garrisons.\nThis failure is a stain on our record and will have notable consequences."
 M267_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A hard crackdown on the M267's operations has resulted in astounding success. Our police forces were more than prepared to take down the enemy and caught them off guard. We have seized countless explosives, equipment, and killed many M267 operatives. Additionally, the raid has granted us large quantities of intel as they failed to destroy it in time.\nThis success will weaken their future operations and lower their ferocity."
 M267_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The M267 knew we were coming. They either evacuated their facilities leaving firetraps set to detonate when the police got deep inside, or established ambushes against our police. Not only has this resulted in a severe failure, but the enemy even mounted counterattacks against our police stations and launch opportunistic supply grab attacks while our officers were busy or dead. The M267 is now vastly more well armed and capable of future attacks in the area. For the time being, we have sent in police reinforcements from nearby areas and even assigned soldiers to patrols to bolster the now weakened government forces.\nThis failure will weaken our attempts to fight them in the area and likely increase their ferocity."
 M267_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "After several recon passes and countless hours of preparation, we finally launched our bombing strikes against remote M267 facilities. From apricot farms to beachside modern houses, their militia's facilities were greatly weakened. Our strikes leveled training facilities, made opportunistic runs against supply convoys, destroyed staging areas, and generally knocked out remote bases. The M267 is now vastly weaker and the lack of these remote facilities will disconnect their network of cells operating between cities.\nThe enemy will now be less capable of making attacks and will be less aggressive in the future."
 M267_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "Not only was our intel incorrect, not only did we destroy countless non-targets, but we actually somehow managed to destroy some of our own nation's assets. Guard posts and our own army's supply trains were ravaged by the misdirection. From what our intel director says, the enemy had been feeding our confidential informants misinformation. In the future we may need to coordinate better with the army to ensure that if we do fail, it will not result in friendly fire.\nThis failure will weaken the army's capability to fight the insurgency and prevent attacks, making them more aggressive."

 #News Events
 Cuban_Revolution.1.d:0 "Fidel Castro and his revolutionary rebel fighters recently launched a series of attacks against the regime of Fulgencio Batista. The government troops defending the regime proved largely ineffective as the rebels secured victories against government forces. Many cite the corruption of the Batista regime, the promotion of political officers over professional, and the popularity of the rebels as reasons why the Cuban military appears incapable of stopping the rebels. Batista, the former Cuban strongman, who has dominated Cuban politics since the late 1930s, fled the country with his family the next day, followed by many of his close advisors, senior ministers and officials. They took a vast fortune totaling in the hundreds of millions, plundered from the government or collected through their years in power. As news spread, the rebels no longer faced military resistance and the people of Havana await the arrival of Castro and his rebels. Large parties have already erupted across the streets of Havana as many Cubans celebrate the end of Batista."
 Cuban_Revolution.10.d:0 "Up in the Sierra Maestra mountains of Cuba, the last remnants of the Cuban revolutionary group, called the July 26th Movement, are being destroyed or are surrendering to Cuban military forces. The rebels began their armed revolt against the regime of Fulgencio Batista as they felt his corruption and domination of the Cuban democratic system could only be ended through armed resistance. The group was led by Fidel Castro and other young men who saw revolution as the only way for Cuba to progress and to end the constant instability which has plagued Cuba since its independence. However, the group ultimately was unable to dislodge Batista or garner enough national support to threaten his regime. Batista successfully marshalled his forces against the rebels and finally succeeded in breaking their resistance to his regime. This victory has galvanized Batista who now feels his regime to be secure and many Cubans fear he may soon just overtly replace the democratic regime with his dictatorship. Time will tell whether the revolutionary fervor unleashed by the July 26th Movement will end with its defeat or if it is now a permanent feature of Cuban political life."
