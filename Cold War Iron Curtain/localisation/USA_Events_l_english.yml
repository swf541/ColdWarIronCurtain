 #Watergate and Agnew Event Chains
 watergate.1.d:0 "President Nixon directed his Attorney General John Mitchell to become chairman of the newly formed Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). Mitchell resigned from his cabinet position and will oversee the CPR. The CPR brings together senior financial supporters, political allies, and advisors of the President to ensure his re-election. The Presidential Counsel John Dean and retired FBI agent Gordon Liddy are playing a key role in the organization. They are expected to keep the President in the loop and help direct specific actions. The organization will work on raising campaign funds, directing it more effectively, investigate, and counter Democratic Party tactics. Opponents to the President are already calling the CRP by the insulting name CREEP."
 watergate.2.d:0 "In a recent high-level meeting of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), former FBI agent Gordon Liddy proposed an extensive espionage campaign against the Democratic Party. The Chairman of the CPR John Mitchell rejected the idea as unrealistic. In a subsequent meeting, Liddy proposed a much more toned-down version of the plan, calling for a wiretap and photographic of campaign documents at the Democratic Party National Headquarters. Mitchell and Presidential Counsel John Dean must consider whether they should approve the proposal as the President cannot be notified. Or if they should reject it and trust the CRP can win the party without inside information. Liddy added he planned on bringing in White House consultant and former CIA agent Howard Hunt, an experienced operative, to implement the plan."
 watergate_alt.1.d:0 "After receiving approval and clandestine funding from the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), Gordon Liddy and John Dean worked to put a team together. Liddy brought in Howard Hunt who assembled a team of former CIA and FBI operatives. The team broke into the Democratic Party National Headquarters located at the Watergate complex in Washington D.C. Undetected, the team was able to wiretap the phones of the Democratic Party chairman and his top advisor. Due to time constraints not many pictures of campaign documents were taken. However, the wiretaps have provided invaluable intelligence for the CRP. They have learned details on Democratic Party electoral funding, strategies, and funding priorities, allowing the CRP to counter and take advantage in several states. With this electoral edge the CRP is confident for a President Nixon victory. The team that conducted the wiretap will be compensated from campaign funds for a job well-done."
 watergate.3.d:0 "After receiving approval and clandestine funding from the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), Gordon Liddy and John Dean worked to put a team together. Liddy brought in Howard Hunt who assembled a team of former CIA and FBI operatives. The team broke into the Democratic Party National Headquarters located at the Watergate complex in Washington D.C. Undetected, the team was able to wiretap the phones of the Democratic Party chairman and his top advisor. However, the wiretap on the chairman failed and a second break-in had to be done. This time a security guard noted tape on the doors, eventually arousing his suspicion. He called the police and the operatives were not warned as their watch out man did not notice the plain clothes policemen enter the building. Subsequently the five operatives in the building were arrested by the police. The local press is already investigating this bizarre break-in."
 watergate.4.d:0 "Senior members of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP) and Presidential Counsel John Dean informed President Nixon of the botched operation at the Watergate. President Nixon is especially concerned as the police found contact information for Howard Hunt among the arrested operatives. Hunt is a well-known White House security consultant so the revelation of his involvement will raise suspicions. The President is inclined to go with the majority of those present at the meeting to initiate an immediate cover-up and denial of CRP or White House involvement. The advantage of this would be to prevent it from becoming an election storyline. The other option is to simply admit to the CRP role in the robbery, blame it on overly enthusiastic members of the group and dismiss them from the administration. This would preserve the President but might prove costly for the election." 
 watergate.5.d:0 "One of the first issues facing the cover-up is preserving the public claim that the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP) was not involved in the Watergate burglary. The chairman of the CRP, the former Attorney General John Mitchell is especially concerned about his wife Martha Mitchell. Martha made a name for herself as a publicly outspoken socialite. She gained notoriety for her tendency to call journalists while drinking. Martha is currently in California but John Mitchell informed Nixon administration officials that when she finds out the details of Watergate, she will realize CRP involvement as one of the arrested men was a former family bodyguard. Her bodyguard Steve King is in place and we must decide if we should try to keep her silent for at least a week to limit a media snowball over Watergate. The other option is to let her be and just downplay her statements as eccentric."
 watergate.6.d:0 "The Nixon administration directed the bodyguard of Martha Mitchell, former FBI agent Steve King to keep her detained in California and cut her off from the media and the telephone. However, she managed to discover details of Watergate and eventually called a journalist friend. She stated she would divorce her husband unless he left the Nixon administration due to their role in the burglary. The call was interrupted by King who ripped the phone line. Despite media interest in her situation, they did not get a hold of her for a week. When they did, she claimed to have been held against her will and heavily drugged to prevent her from talking to the media. However, her claims have turned her story into a joke to many in the country. Among the strongest Nixon supporters, the claims of being forcibly detained and drugged appears farfetched, despite the physical evidence she showed reporters."
 watergate.7.d:0 "Since the Watergate break-in reached the media, the Washington Post has been especially dedicated in investigating the potential White House connections. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein are taking the lead on the case, developing White House sources and investigating the origin of the money given to the captured burglars. Senior administration officials have recognized early on how focused the Post is on its investigation and have proposed two ways to handle them. One is to actively discredit and target the Washington Post as having a bias and peddling false allegations. Most other media appear uninterested on Watergate, focusing more on the election campaign and many would support our allegations. The other approach would be to ignore the paper and let them operate, this would demonstrate our lack of concern and may push the paper to consider their investigations may not be as groundbreaking as they think."
 watergate.8.d:0 "Long-term congressman Wright Patman, the Chairman of the Banking Committee concluded its investigation into Watergate. Patman took on the investigation by studying the hundred-dollar bills involved in paying the burglars and trying to trace its origin. However, the White House launched a denial campaign, claiming the investigation was politically motivated. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford played a major role in hindering the investigation, blocking its attempts to subpoena White House officials which led to an incomplete investigation. Other Democrats also refused to aid Patman as they felt his investigation was hindering the electoral campaign and leaving the party open to accusations of being politically motivated. Although Patman failed to find the origins of the money, the Washington Post and other senate investigators are now looking into the money trail as a means to find a White House connection to Watergate." 
 watergate.9.d:0 "Judge Sirica sentenced the give convicted Watergate buglers in court recently. Some pled guilty while others were convicted. Although the White House hoped the final sentencing would mark the end of interest in the case, it appears media interest has only expanded. During the trial details emerged over the money trail from the Committee for the Re-Election of the President to the burglars. This heightened public interest in the case and has pushed the media to investigate what roll President Nixon had in the Watergate burglary. In addition, the trial revealed the participation of Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy. Both are former intelligence agents with known association with the White House. It appears the investigation and media interest is intensifying rapidly." 
 watergate.10.d:0 "With the conviction of the Watergate burglars only leading to more media and government investigation over White House involvement, the President has met with his senior advisors to plan is next move. The President and some of his advisors are inclined to initiate a purge to remove those who did the initial cover-up. Essentially the plan would be to cover-up the cover-up and end speculation of Nixon involvement in Watergate. The other group of advisors argue by firing these officials or moving them out, this will only raise suspicions, increase public support for congressional investigations, and make the White House look guilty. Instead they suggest everyone stay in place and the White House ride out the rest of the media speculation."
 watergate.11.d:0 "The Senate recently voted overwhelmingly to establish a Watergate Committee to investigate the Watergate scandal from different angles. Senior White House officials including John Dean have testified, raising pressure on the White House. Under questioning, White House assistant Alexander Butterfield revealed the White House has a tape-recording system in place. The Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox quickly subpoenaed the tapes. President Nixon cited national security concerns and executive privilege and refused. Now Cox must decide if he will accept this argument from the White House, essentially ending the investigation or if he will refuse to withdraw the subpoena. The interest of congress and the American people appear to be in having the tapes released." 
 watergate.12.d:0 "The refusal of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox to withdraw his subpoena of the White House tapes has reached a boiling point. President Nixon on Friday offered a compromise where Senator Stennis would listen to and transcribe the tapes for the Special Prosecutor. However, Cox refused and the next day, Nixon directed the Attorney General to fire him. The Attorney General refused, as he promised congress he would not interfere and instead resigned. The Deputy Attorney General was then asked to fire Cox and he too refused and resigned. This left it up to the Solicitor General who complied with the request to fire Archibald Cox. President Nixon then attempted to dismantle the investigation but the resignations and firing fueled public, congressional, and judicial anger towards the White House. A new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski will instead be selected. The White House hopes he limits his investigation and not expand it as Cox attempted to do."
 watergate.13.d:0 "The issue of releasing the tapes did not end with the firing of Archibald Cox as the Special Prosecutor. His replacement Leon Jaworski ended up following his predecessor and did not wrap up the investigative as President Nixon hoped. Instead the issue of the release of White House tapes went to the Supreme Court. In a stunning defeat for the President, the Court voted against Nixon and his claims of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes to the Special Prosecutor. The White House complied, and the initial tapes revealed Nixon approved of the cover-up and plans by John Dean to pay off the participants of Watergate. However, the tapes do not reveal if President Nixon was aware of the payoffs from the beginning or even of the plot before it occurred. Regardless, the release of the tapes is a big blow for Nixon and his team."
 watergate.14.d:0 "The White House quietly released a previously unreleased tape from only a few days after the break-in. In the tape President Nixon learns of how the burglars are paid by his campaign and agrees with the coverup plans. He agrees to tell the CIA to contact the FBI to stop their investigation as the President could not predict their investigation. Many argue this discussion indicates a direct involvement of Nixon in the Watergate scandal and a direct attempt to interfere in the investigation. In its defense the White House notes the CIA rightly concluded the break-in was not a national security threat and President Nixon eventually ordered the FBI to complete a thorough investigation. Regardless, the clear proof of the involvement of President Nixon in the cover-up from the earliest days has shattered his political position and legitimacy."
 watergate.15.d:0 "The release of the Smoking Gun tape along with the other actions of President Nixon and his staff has led a delegation of Congressional leaders to visit the President. Senior Republicans congress leaders informed the President that they expected the three Articles of Impeachment to easily pass the House and Senate. The Republican leaders stated the President would barely be able to get a quarter of the vote from the House and his situation in the Senate was worse. The polls also indicated the public had also turned against the President and he is left with two choices. One is to resign and avoid the humiliation of an impeachment vote and Senate trial. The other option is to refuse, stay in power and be forcibly removed from power, perhaps the American people will come around to support him as he faces the wrath of Congress."
 watergate.26.d:0 "In a nationally televised address to the nation, President Nixon announced his intention to resign as President. Nixon stated his regret that he would not finish his term. He stated his resignation was for the best interest of the nation. He hoped his decision would help America move past the controversy of Watergate and heal the country. The following day, Nixon and his family bid farewell to the White House staff. They then exited on a helicopter to Andrews AFB before being flown to their home in California. After years of controversy and shocking revelations, the tumultuous Presidency has come to an end."
 watergate.16.d:0 "The gambit of President Nixon to stay in office despite the loss of Congressional support ended in failure. The American people did not rally behind President Nixon and both houses of Congress quickly convicted him on all three charges in his articles of impeachment. The President will officially be removed from office and will now be open to prosecution. Many believe his successor will likely pardon Nixon though there is no guarantee this will occur. The President said he respected the actions of Congress and will begin preparations to vacate the office as soon as possible."
 watergate.17.d:0 "\nWith President Nixon no longer in office, Vice President Spiro Agnew has taken the oath of President. President Agnew recently survived his own corruption scandal and was able to keep his position. The popular Maryland politician and World War II combat veteran hopes he can unite the American people and spearhead a new campaign of national unity. Nixon had selected Agnew as his running mate due to his centrist political outlook and now it appears the country will need someone like that to restore executive prestige and get legislation passed."
 watergate.18.d:0 "\nWith President Nixon no longer in office, Vice President Gerald Ford has taken the oath of President. President Ford, a moderate former Congressman took over the Vice Presidency from Spiro Agnew who had resigned following allegations of corruption. Nixon selected Ford due to his loyalty to the party and impeccable reputation across both aisles in Congress. President Ford has indicated to his friends that he plans to bring a Presidency of national healing and restore confidence in the office and the Republican Party. Whether he can achieve this remains to be seen."
 watergate.19.d:0 "With President Nixon no longer in office, Speaker of the House Carl Albert has taken the oath of President. Although the Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency, the office of the Vice President is currently empty. The former Vice President, Spiro Agnew had recently resigned amid corruption allegations, unrelated to the Watergate scandal. The position had not been filled because of Democratic obstruction during Vice Presidential confirmation hearings. The delays were such that Nixon could not confirm a Vice President in time for his resignation. In an unprecedented move, the Presidency for the first time has gone to the Speaker of the House. Republicans are particularly outraged as the Speaker is a Democrat and Republicans accuse the Democrats of slowing the confirmation hearings to steal the Presidency. President Albert believes the country needs a strong champion of the law and constitution and that was what he was."
 watergate.25.d:0 "A recent investigation by the US Attorney of Maryland into corruption in Baltimore County took a dramatic turn recently. Although Agnew last held a position at the county years ago and was beyond the statute of limitations, one of the accused claimed to have paid bribes to Agnew after he became Vice president. President Nixon met with Agnew to discuss the accusations, which Agnew emphatically denied. Agnew also went to the media and publicly declared his total innocence to the charges. He said any money he received was for campaign contributions and nothing else. However, the media and prosecutor remain focused on investigating Agnew and trying to undercover and prove the accusations against him."
 watergate.20.d:0 "With the investigation against Vice President Spiro Agnew intensifying, he has decided to visit Speaker of the House Carl Albert to discuss if his status as Vice President protects him from prosecution. The Nixon administration quietly informed Agnew that if the allegations have any truth or prove too distracting, he should consider doing the right thing and resign. Speaker Albert could tell Agnew that Congress could protect him from prosecution. However, Speaker Albert, a deeply devoted constitutionalist, does know that Congress did investigate the Vice President in the early nineteenth century which would be the precedent that Congress could use. He stated Congress had no right to interfere with the courts. If the Democrat Albert tells Agnew he could be charged, Agnew will have to resign, if not, Agnew can try to stay on."
 watergate.21.d:0 "After discussions with the Speaker of the House and increasing pressure from the media, Vice President Agnew has decided to resign. Even after he recently spoke to a large audience in California and proclaimed his innocence. He also came to an agreement with the prosecutor and agreed to a plea agreement in which he would not serve jail time but will have to plead no contest and pay a fine. President Nixon in response wrote a letter in which he praised the former Vice President for his immense patriotism and loyalty to the United States. He stated the resignation was done to protect the country and remove distractions in the executive. Members of Congress were in shock by the news and President Nixon hopes to quickly have a new Vice President confirmed by Congress."
 watergate.22.d:0 "\nFollowing the resignation of Vice President, the White House offered Gerald Ford to Congress as be confirmed as Vice President. The selection of Ford appears to be a smart one as he is a known moderate with an excellent reputation for integrity. However, during the initial hearings some Democrats noted the role Ford played in stopping the Patman Committee. So far Ford has not denied his role in slowing that investigation, stating this was part of his duties as House minority. Democratic representatives approached the Speaker of the House Carl Albert with a proposal. They can drag out the hearings for the foreseeable future. Without a Vice President this would leave the White House for Albert if Nixon resigns. However, Albert, a strict constitutionalist is torn by this idea and feels it maybe a moral crime to not confirm Ford. However, he knows he may have to take drastic action for the national interest."


 CIA_60s.1.d:0 "Last Night on May the 30th El Jefe's' Chevrolet Bel Air was intercepted by a vehicle full of gunman while En Route to San Cristobal from Santo Domingo. The vehicle pulled up behind Trujillo's car on the deserted highway and tailed it before opening fire with CIA supplied M1 Carbines. As Trujillo's damaged car was ground to a stop on the highway's shoulder by his chauffeur, the vehicle containing the armed men pulled in front of it, blocking its path. An intense, although One-sided fire fight ensued between the gunmen and an armed Trujillo along with his chauffeur. Eventually wounded,Trujillo attempted to escape his bullet riddled car only to be gunned down in the middle of the street. The gunman then packed his body into their vehicle and sped away into the night, leaving the wreckage and blood behind for the Local Police to find."
 CIA_60s.2.d:0 "With the continuation of our non-interventionist agenda towards the left dictating our Foreign Policy, the CIA has deemed it necessary to remove the President of Ecuador, Jose Velasco. The CIA had only come to this conclusion after Velasco's stubborn resistance and opposition to the USA's policy of breaking ties with Communist Cuba and suppression of Leftist and Communist activities at home. The CIA has infiltrated the structure of Political Organizations within Ecuador ranging across the political scale, directing all citizens away from support of Communists in Cuba and Anti-American views. It has also began electronic monitoring of Sensitive Frequencies in Ecuador. With all essential information required, acquired, the CIA moved forward with the removal of Velasco from the Office of Ecuadorian President. With the force of the Ecuadorian Military on the CIA's side Velasco had no choice but to surrender power. Velasco has been replaced with his Vice President, Carlos Arosemena, a figure more lenient to American Policies."
 Wallace.1.d:0 "In the wake of the highly controversial President [USA.GetLeader]'s election to the highest office in the United States, the newly elected official has asserted that there will be order in his United States. President [USA.GetLeader] has handed down an executive order declaring martial law in urban areas, citing what he referred to as 'a deplorable criminal epidemic caused by desegregation and godless pinkos.' In the same address, he boasted that he has 'drawn the line in the dust against criminals,' further stating that 'bringing in the United States Armed Forces is the surest way to stomp out the illicit activities perpetrated by these communists and unAmerican undesirables.'"

 usa.1.d:0 "Since 1959, Eisenhower has been writing his final statement to the public. Today, he finally held it.\nThe speech was "a solemn moment in a decidedly unsolemn time", warning a nation "giddy with prosperity, infatuated with youth and glamour, and aiming increasingly for the easy life." Despite being a politician with a military background and the only general to be elected president in the 20th century, he famously warned the nation with regards to the corrupting influence of what he describes as the 'military-industrial complex'. He also expressed his up most concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government."
 usa.2.d:0 "In Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, the Supreme Court, in a ruling written by Justice Earl Warren, held that Mexican Americans and all other nationality groups in the United States had equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers appeared before the US Supreme Court. The ruling is seen as an extension of protection to minority groups within the country and an acknowledgement that groups other than blacks could be discriminated against."

New genres, such as crime and horror comics, have sparked outrage with allegations that these comics inspire illegal behaviour among minors, known as Juvenile Delinquency. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency was tasked by the Senate to investigate these allegations. The infamous Comic Book Hearings took place on April 21st, 22nd and June 4th 1954, and had a profound effect on the future of comic books, with the taste of graphic images in the comics being brought into question. The publishing of the book ‘Seduction of the Innocent' has galvanized public opinion against comic books and given the industry unfavorable press coverage, effectively forcing them to adopt the Comics Code Authority, enforcing self-censorship upon themselves and resulting in the harsh censorship or even cancellation of many long-standing comic series. The ramifications of this are yet to be fully felt, but it's already clear that this is a devastating blow for the already struggling American comic book industry."

With the president committing himself to the cause of desegregation, tensions with the those who advocate for maintaining the status quo have increased considerably. Kefauver himself now faces widespread opposition from Dixiecrat influences in his party, although this is partially offset by increasing support from those sympathetic to the civil rights movement. One thing that is certain, however, is that the process of desegregating American society has been greatly sped up by these developments - and the south may have to embrace the winds of change blowing their way."

In response to such acts of violence, President Ferdinand Marcos mobilized the Philippine Constabulary and broke up the demonstrations violently, if necessary.

Opposition groups claim however that the vast majority of terrorist attacks experienced by the Philippines were orchestrated by the President's inner circle of military generals to promote fear and terror amongst the populace, thereby giving legitimacy to his declaration. Nevertheless, the implementation of Martial Law was swift, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP, able to secure strategic areas detrimental to the Marcos regime, and the implementation of the 'General Orders' placed on the proclamation. Observers are mixed with their response to this declaration, as some sympathize with the government, while others criticize it, believing in the story of the opposition."
 kef.9.d:0 "In a decisive move by President Kefauver of the United States, the process for nominating Democratic candidates has been radically altered to increase the effectiveness of the manner in which Democratic presidential candidates are selected. Traditionally, candidates were selected primarily in secret by party leaders, sometimes resulting in the selection of candidates who had never run as a delegate in a primary election. The President has put forward guidelines on how candidates should be selected, swiftly modernizing the nomination process to take into account the will of the people and effectively forcing states to select their delegates via Presidential Primaries. The result of this reform is that the Democratic voters have a much larger role in the outcome than they had previously, and the move has taken a significant amount of power out of the hands of powerful politicians and into the hands of the people. It's now clear that the future Democratic candidates will represent the people more than they did in previous elections. Whether this will have an effect on future elections remains to be seen."

This decision has prompted great outrage from Liberal elements within the Democratic Party and there are scattered calls for the impeachment of the President.

To no surprise, Truman has announced before congress his intentions to immediately enforce the ruling throughout the country. While causing considerable unrest in the south, actual resistance has been limited. Despite scattered calls for his impeachment by Dixiecrats within the Democratic Party, no solid base of opposition has formed, and it appears that the President will face no considerable political threats in the near future. How the southern states will handle these rapid changes and adapt to the new political climate remains a matter of contention."

Recently, the President has proposed legislation to radically expand the FDA's authority in public health affairs, and today the changes have been officially ratified by Congress. With the bill coming into effect in the following days, the changes will likely be a major factor in the ongoing fight for the improvement of public health, although the changes have drawn criticism from those arguing against what they perceive as too much government intervention in the lives of American citizens."

 kef.1.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American President Estes Kefauver has officially declared war on the Italian-American mafia, vowing to root them out and ‘restore order' to American cities. Originating mainly from descendants of Italian immigrants, the mafia rose to prominence during the prohibition era and remain active in many industrial American cities, such as Chicago, operating a vast and well-organized criminal network. Before his rise to the presidency, Kefauver presided over hearings in 1950 that brought nationwide attention to the growing issue of organized crime, and following his election to the presidency many have expected him to take legal action regarding the issue. Until now, the mafia have faced relatively little opposition from law enforcement in building their criminal empire, but it now appears that this will soon change. Reactions to the President's speech have been varied, however there seems to be a distinct contrast between those strongly in favour of clamping down on organized crime and those who predict the drastic consequences a conflict with the mafia may have on the societies of areas in the direct vicinity of the inevitable conflict. Several congressmen have even suggested that it may be too hard to completely root out the well-established mafia and would only lead to further conflict, anger and damage within urban communities. Regardless of the consequences, this ambitious move will have significant long-term consequences to the lives of many, but whether the attempts will bear fruit remains unforeseeable."
 adlai_civil.2.d:0 "Many conservative southern voters split from the Democrat Party in 1948 to form the Dixiecrat Party, however they performed poorly in the 1948 elections and many returned to the Democrats, causing the end of the Dixiecrats. Following the election of President Adlai Stevenson, many former Dixiecrats have been emboldened by the president's pro-segregationist policies and their influence within the party has grown rapidly. Throughout his term, more vocal Dixiecrats have openly advocated for the president to take further steps to protect southern traditions, and make sure Jim Crow laws are upheld in the south. Recently, pressure on the President from Dixiecrats within the party have intensified, causing many internal issues for the President and pressuring him into action. In response to this pressure, President Adlai has announced before congress his intention to uphold Jim Crow laws in the southern states. This move immediately prompted protests amongst civil rights supporters and many have voiced concerns over the implications of this on the treatment of African-Americans in the south. With the president bowing to Dixiecrat interests, it seems the desegregation movement has suffered a major setback."

 Shanghai_Communique.1.t:0 "Across the Pacific"
 Shanghai_Communique.1.d:0 "Although we have had limited amicable interactions with [PRC.GetNameDef] since the end of the Chinese Civil War, our top diplomats have been able to open diplomatic channels to [PRC.GetNameDef] through [PAK.GetNameDef]. Most presidents have held a strong anti-communist stance since the rise of Stalin's Warsaw Pact and even as far back as the Russian Civil War, but this is an unprecedented opportunity to pave over relations with [PRC.GetLeader] and allow us to focus on our other enemies."
 Shanghai_Communique.2.t:0 "Across the Pacific"
 Shanghai_Communique.2.d:0 "[USA.GetNameDef] has proposed a diplomatic mission to our humble nation headed by none other than President [USA.GetPresident]! This could be monumental for diplomacy between our opposing nations, as well as our status internationally! However, we can also take this opportunity to deny these capitalists the time of day."
 Shanghai_Communique.3.t:0 "Across the Pacific - China Accepts!"
 Shanghai_Communique.3.d:0 "Although our nations have had their differences in the past, [PRC.GetLeader] has agreed to our mission into their lands! Plans are already in motion for President [USA.GetLeader] to fly to Shanghai and meet with the Chairman."
 Shanghai_Communique.4.t:0 "Across the Pacific - China Declines!"

 Shanghai_Communique.5.d:0 "After a brief layover in Hawaii and Guam, President [USA.GetLeader] has touched down in Shanghai! The President was met with a military honour guard and a small crowd on a grey winter's day. Although little was expected, the president was noted as having a hint of disappointment at the lack of "thousands of people in cheering crowds" after the end of decades of hostile diplomacy."
 Shanghai_Communique.6.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]An American in Shanghai"
 Shanghai_Communique.6.d:0 "After decades of hostile diplomacy, [USA.GetNameDef] and [PRC.GetNameDef] have begun the long process of reconciliation. President [USA.GetLeader] has touched down in Shanghai as a part of a week long diplomatic mission to normalize their relations and discuss issues between their nations. The world watches with bated breath as these political giants sit down at the meeting table"
 Shanghai_Communique.7.t:0 "A Meeting with the President"
 Shanghai_Communique.7.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] is approaching Beijing as a part of his trip to our humble nation. Although we can keep this amicable and apolitical, part of the conditions of the visit were a discussion over diplomatic relations between our sovereign nations."
 Shanghai_Communique.8.t:0 "A Meeting with the Chairman"
 Shanghai_Communique.8.d:0 "After a week of travelling north from Shanghai along the Chinese Coast, President [USA.GetLeader] has finally arrived in Beijing. Almost as soon as the American president arrived, Chairman [PRC.GetLeader] summoned him for a brief meeting at Jinjiang Hotel. Upon their meeting, the Chairman coyly said to the President "I believe our old friend [ROC.GetLeader] would not approve of this." Though this meeting was brief, its importance in forwarding diplomacy between western democracies and eastern communist states is doubtless. As a part of this meeting, these world leaders have further attempted to normalize relations. Topics discussed included an agreement to avoid hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as acknowledgement of the one China policy."

 Shanghai_Communique.11.t:0 "A Meeting with the President - The USA Disagrees"
 Shanghai_Communique.11.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] appeared shaken, then angry upon hearing our terms. The President has rejected any chance of reconciliation between our two nations, stating that they would never abandon [ROC.GetNameDef], especially at the request of a foreign nation."
 Shanghai_Communique.12.t:0 "The Shanghai Communique"
 Shanghai_Communique.12.d:0 "As a part of an ongoing visit to [PRC.GetNameDef], [USA.GetLeader] has met with [PRC.GetLeader] in order to iron out diplomatic conflict and ensure peace between the two nations. This has resulted in a signed communique of peace and understanding from the two leaders. They have stated in this joint declaration that there will be no struggle for hegemony between the nations, and that [USA.GetNameDef] acknowledges the one China policy - effectively meaning that it no longer recognizes the nation of [ROC.GetNameDef]. This is a watershed moment in relations between the West and the East, and surely means good things moving into the future."

 Shanghai_Communique.13.d:0 "As a part of an ongoing visit to [PRC.GetNameDef], [USA.GetLeader] has met with [PRC.GetLeader] in order to iron out diplomatic conflict and ensure peace between the two nations. Although there were some bumps in negotiations, the two nations have released a signed communique stating that there will be no struggle for hegemony between the two nations in the Pacific. However, [USA.GetNameDef] has refused to acknowledge the one China policy. With the announcement, President [USA.GetLeader] further elaborated in front of a disgruntled [PRC.GetLeader], stating that "our nation will stay loyal to its allies, through thick and thin." Although this does not seem to be [PRC.GetNameDef]'s desired outcome, it is still a watershed moment in relations between the east and the west, and a brief moment of reconciliation."
 Shanghai_Communique.14.t:0 "The Shanghai Communique"
 Shanghai_Communique.14.d:0 "As a part of an ongoing visit to [PRC.GetNameDef], [USA.GetLeader] has met with [PRC.GetLeader] in order to iron out diplomatic conflict and ensure peace between the two nations. However, things quickly turned south when the president mentioned unease at recognizing the One China policy, which would recognize [PRC.GetNameDef]'s claims on [ROC.GetNameDef]. Upset at this unease, [PRC.GetLeader] ended the negotiations in anger, stating that that in itself was a challenge to their sovereignty and hegemony in the Pacific, and that a refusal to recognize their policies was a refusal to recognize their nation. [USA.GetLeader]'s visit will continue, but an air of tension has replaced the once cheerful tone."
 Shanghai_Communique.15.t:0 "The Great Negotiator"
 Shanghai_Communique.15.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] returned to [USA.GetNameDef] following what has been declared a triumph of diplomacy by papers within the democratic world.

Although the president went to [PRC.GetNameDef] with the goal of diplomacy, he has come back empty handed after his challenge of [PRC.GetLeader]'s terms. Our relations are now as hostile as ever."

 Department_of_Energy.1.d:0 "The federal government recently approved the establishment of a Department of Energy. This will be a cabinet position and seeks to consolidate the various energy programs across the federal government with the defense responsibilities related to the nuclear program. For years energy policy, especially research has been hampered by a lack of focus due to the different programs and agencies involved. Even more significantly, the nuclear program has also been uncoordinated, especially in terms of design, production, and research. With the Department of Energy, all these programs and policies will be coordinated, and the government expects a great improvement in how effectively the United States will be able to develop new energy technologies and implement them across the country."
 Abolish_JCNAE.1.d:0 "The United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was officially abolished. At its peak, the committee held jurisdiction over all bills and regulations related to the military and civilian aspects of nuclear power. It also enjoyed a unique legislative veto that allowed it a voice in executive decision making over nuclear policy. Indeed, it was considered to be one of the most powerful congressional committees in American history. However, over recent years, its jurisdiction and oversight had been greatly reduced due to other senate and congressional committees taking on the oversight of civilian nuclear energy. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency and the establishment of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also made the committee increasingly redundant. With these factors in mind, the committee was formally abolished today in what many see as a victory for the executive branch and its efforts to consolidate nuclear policy in the executive branch." #Abolishment of the Joint Committee on Nuclear on Atomic Energy
 Ford.5.d:0 "President Gerald Ford today announced Nelson Rockefeller, the former governor of New York, as his candidate for Vice President. The decision to select Rockefeller saw immediate backlash among conservative Republicans who felt President Ford was betraying the values of the party by selecting a liberal Republican. Indeed, the congressional confirmation hearings are expected to be grueling as even conservative Democrats are expected to ask tough questions. However, his confirmation is expected to be achieved in the end. Upon making his announcement, President Ford, pointed out the executive experience Rockefeller has and his track record of successfully implementing policy. Observers note that Rockefeller may prove to be a major electoral asset for Ford in the next presidential election. Rockefeller can attract support from communities traditionally opposed to conservative Republicans and his inclusion as Vice President will broaden the appeal of Ford."
 Ford.6.d:0 "President Gerald Ford today announced before Congress that the greatest threat facing the country was inflation. He announced the launch of a new campaign called Whip Inflation Now (WIN) as a voluntary movement for American citizens to come together and battle inflation at home in coordination with his public measures for inflation control. President Ford stated he would also welcome letters from Americans with suggestions on controlling spending at home. The White House later announced those who participate in WIN should wear pins and shirts with WIN written to show solidarity. In addition, this program fits with the belief that it is up to private citizens working with the government to solve the current inflation crisis, not a bigger government. Initial reaction to WIN has been one of ridicule by many Americans and opponents to the President are manipulating the logo to turn into criticisms of the President."
 Ford.7.d:0 "In a nationally televised address to the nation, newly appointed President Gerald Ford announced he was pardoning former President Richard Nixon. President Ford stated the United States needed to move on and heal from the recent controversies and the only way it will end is through the presidential pardon. Former President Nixon resigned over the Watergate Scandal and the recent release of compromising White House recordings. The decision to pardon President Nixon has not been well received. Opponents accuse Ford of colluding with Nixon to elevate himself to President while others suggest Nixon should have faced the consequences for his actions. Political observers note the reputation of President Ford as an honest broker will be hit by this decision. However, supporters of the President insist his decision was not the result of a political deal but the morally correct thing to do and he will take the political backlash in order to heal the nation."
 Albert.1.d:0 "President Carl Albert announced he would confirm the appointment of Gerald Ford as his Vice President. The decision to keep a Republican Vice President is seen as a conciliatory act considering the extraordinary circumstances which led to President Albert assuming his office. Gerald Ford is seen as a moderate Republican with a strong moral character that Democrats and Republicans both respect. President Albert stated he looked forward to working closely with Vice President Ford. Although the press largely supported the decision of President Albert, there were grumblings among Democrats who fear Vice President Ford, a close friend of the former President Richard Nixon, may use his position to undermine proceedings against him."
 Albert.2.d:0 "The trial of former President Richard Nixon concluded in his conviction earlier today. While in office, former President Nixon led a conspiracy to break into the Democratic Party offices at Watergate and subsequently aided in the coverup. President Carl Albert, who as Speaker of the House helped push the congressional investigation, welcomed the decision by the court. He stated that no man is above the law and all men are responsible for his actions. President Albert noted with the trial done he hopes the nation can finally heal and move on to a brighter future and a more transparent government. Many Americans, even supporters of the former President, agree with this sentiment about responsibility."
 Agnew.1.d:0 "President Spiro Agnew has announced the appointment of George Romney as Vice President of the United States. Romney was once a strong candidate for President and seen as a Nixon political rival though he did join his first administration. As governor, Romney was able to garner support in blue collar Michigan and his appeal to working families is seen by many in the Republican Party as an asset for the next presidential election. Vice President Romney also was quite adept at working across the aisles with Democrats which President Spiro also sees as a major asset as he tries to implement policy in Congress. Although not the choice of more conservative Republicans, many across the country have expressed satisfaction with the new Vice President."
 Agnew.2.d:0 "In a nationally televised address to the nation, newly inaugurated President Spiro Agnew announced he was pardoning former President Richard Nixon. President Agnew stated the United States needed to move on and heal from the recent controversies and the only way it will end is through the presidential pardon. Former President Nixon resigned over the Watergate Scandal and the recent release of compromising White House recordings. The decision to pardon President Nixon has not been well received. Opponents accuse Agnew of colluding with Nixon to elevate himself to President while others suggest Nixon should have faced the consequences for his actions. Political observers note the reputation of President Agnew will be hurt due to his close relationship with Nixon. However, supporters of the President insist his decision was not the result of a political deal but the morally correct thing to do and he will take the political backlash in order to heal the nation."
 Amnesty.1.d:0 "The United States announced a program to offer amnesty to those who avoided being drafted by the armed forces. During times of recent conflict, a number of Americans chose to flee the United States or go into hiding to avoid their required military service. Many who avoided the draft or deserted claimed to do so out of a moral conviction or a belief that they could not support military actions. The new program will give those who avoided the draft amnesty if they request it from the government. This policy is seen as a compromise. While draft dodgers will not be directly punished, by requesting the amnesty they are still admitting guilt. The new policy is no doubt a compromise, but the government believes it is essential to resolving the issue of draft dodgers and bring these men back to their families."
 ERA.5.d:0 "\nAlthough originally proposed in the late 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has finally been ratified in the Constitution of the United States of America. The ERA ends any and all legal distinctions between men and women, especially in terms of divorce, property, and employment. Supporters of the bill now argue American women will finally enjoy all the legal rights of men and no longer be second class citizens. However, a number of middle-class women have opposed the ERA as eroding traditional gender roles, threatening the rights of mothers in divorce cases, and opening the door to women being conscripted for military service. They have called the ERA a travesty and are campaigning for states to oppose ratifying the amendment in their legislatures. Regardless of this opposition, the ERA was successfully passed, and large crowds of supporters are said to be jubilantly welcoming the news across the country."
 USA_Marijuana.1.d:0 "The United States has officially approved the decriminalization of marijuana. The drug has long been associated with counterculture and was a target of intense police crackdowns. However, many began arguing such a focus was detracting from the investigation of more serious crimes or the targeting of more harmful drugs in the United States. This was bolstered by recent articles suggesting the impact of marijuana was not much different than tobacco smoking or alcohol use. In addition, many states argued the potential profit to be made from taxes on marijuana may bring huge windfalls of cash to the government. These arguments all worked to sway the government to decriminalize the drug, however, there are opponents who argue this decision will end up hurting the American people as supporters for decriminalization downplayed the negative consequences legalization will cause."
 Clark_Amendment.1.d:0 "The violence in Angola has seen multiple foreign players involving themselves by supporting the different factions all fighting for control. The United States has also been aiding anti-communist groups on the ground with military aid. However, recent reports and exposes regarding incidents of human rights abuses and mass killings against civilians has spurred Congress to act. Senator Dick Clark has passed an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act called the Clark Amendment which forbade the United States to offer aid to private Angolan groups involved in military operations. The Clark Amendment has infuriated anti-communist advocates who believe support for these groups is a vital American interest. However, many Americans also support the act and believe the United States should not help perpetuate the continued violence in Angola."
 ELS_COUP.1.d:0 "The El Salvador government had proved largely ineffective in dealing with economic inequality and the rising influence of the extreme left. This resulted in a coalition between moderate military officers and civilians who launched a coup to overthrow the government and put a civil-military junta, known as Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG), to power. The junta enjoyed the support of the United States who fear a communist takeover. The junta has initiated a policy of moderate reforms to appease the population and brutal repression against what it identifies as the communist left. However, the increasing violence and the rise of government-supported death squads has greatly weakened the reform program and resistance, especially in the countryside is increasing."
 ELS_COUP.2.d:0 "The escalation of violence in El Salvador took a darker turn as news emerged that armed gunmen assassinated beloved Archbishop Oscar Romero as he was finishing a sermon. No group has claimed responsibility, but the brazen assassination of an outspoken human rights activists, clergyman, and champion for the poor, has shocked and angered many in the country. Many are pointing the finger at either the ruling Revolutionary Government Junta or a death squad associated with it. It is believed Romero was killed for his support of human right and recent calls for Salvadorian troops to disobey orders that violate human rights. The government has denied responsibility and say it is a tragic consequence of the escalating violence on both sides and no one can be blamed. The Catholic Church is said to be demanding a full, international investigation into the killing."
 Ford.10.d:0 "Members of the prestigious annual Host Breakfast invited President Ford to address the gathering after the Democratic California Governor refused to commit for the event. Eyeing the potential of galvanizing supporters in the state in preparation of the upcoming Presidential election, President Ford arrived to address the event. Former Manson Family member Lynette Fromme also arrived at the event armed with a pistol. Fromme had recently read of how pollution was threatening to destroy the environment, specifically the California redwood trees. The follower of the infamous serial killer decided that she would kill the President and show the establishment the seriousness of the environmental cause. After the event, President Ford began walking through a park to the California State House to meet leading California political leaders. As he approached, Fromme got to within a few feet of President Ford. She lifted the pistol and aimed it at the President..."
 Ford.11.d:0 "When Fromme pulled the trigger, a click was heard as it turned out the assassin had failed to chamber a round into the gun. Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf wrestled Fromme to the ground as she was noted as laughing at the luck of her not being able to complete her task. President Ford appeared unperturbed by the event and continued his program for the day. Many Americans applauded the President for his bravery in the face of death. The President himself stated he saw her raise the weapon but did not see the threat as serious, especially after Fromme was detained. Upon returning to the White House, Ford was greeted by his jubilant family and is said to be taking some time off. Fromme is expected to face trial for her attempted assassination. The FBI is investigating whether the infamous serial killer Charlie Manson played any role in the actions of his former disciple."
 Ford.12.d:0 "When Fromme pulled the trigger, a bullet hit President Gerald Ford in the chest. The President was rushed to the local hospital as the Secret Service took Fromme into custody. Fromme was heard shouting about how those who kill mother earth will suffer the consequences. Within hours, the President was pronounced dead. News of the assassination has sent shock waves across the country and the world. President Ford long enjoyed a reputation of integrity and honesty and statements of condolences have already begun flooding in. Crowds of mourners are said to be waiting outside the White House. Internationally, many nations are also said to be shocked and uncertain with what the future holds for the United States. Vice President Rockefeller was privately sworn in as the new President and the nation awaits its new future."
 
 Allende.1.d:0 "When President Salvador Allende took power in Chile, his regime announced the beginning of a new socialist experiment for South America. Since taking power he has faced Supreme Court criticism and a Congress resolution calling on the military to act. President Allende pointed out these efforts were undemocratic attempts to remove the democratic choice of the people. Many in the country suspect these efforts are being influenced by the CIA who are desperate to see socialism fail in Chile. Early this morning however, a more serious crisis has emerged as news reached the capital that the navy had seized control of Valparaiso. President Allende now has news that armed troops are seizing locations across the capital and that radio stations have been bombed by the Air Force. A full-blown coup appears to be underway and President Allende must act fast. The next few hours will determine the future of Chile."
 Allende.2.d:0 "When news first reached President Allende that the navy had seized Valparaiso, he sought to contact his senior military officers. He could not reach them and feared the coup leaders had detained the senior officers. However, it turned out the senior officers, except the Navy Chief who was detained, were leading the coup attempt and by the time President Allende realized this it was too late. The coup leaders demanded a resignation, but President Allende refused as he was the elected President of Chile. Instead, armed troops attempted to seize the Presidential Palace but faced resistance from loyal socialist militia fighters. As military forces closed in, Allende addressed the nation, stating he would not legitimize the coup or be a tool for the new regime. Shortly after the new military government announced President Allende had committed suicide. After a brief struggle, Chile is now under the control of the military."
 Allende.3.d:0 "When news first reached President Allende of the coup he feared the coup leaders had detained his senior military officers as he could not contact them. However, it turned out the senior officers, except Admiral Montero, were leading the coup attempt. But the coup plotters failed to detain Admiral Montero who managed to restore his control over the navy. As soldiers began occupying key sites across the capital, news reached that the navy in Vaparaiso returned the city to government authority. The ensuing confusion slowed the military and some regional commanders backed out of the plot. An attempt hours later to seize the Presidential Palace ended in failure as a large number of pro-Allende militia were able to reinforce the Palace from attack. Shortly thereafter the coup leaders surrendered and ordered their forces to stand down. President Allende addressed the nation, announcing democratic rule has triumphed over tyranny and conspiracy."
 War_Powers.1.d:0 "The United States Congress has overridden the presidential veto and have passed a War Powers Resolution or War Powers Act. The new law intends to check executive power by requiring the President to acquire congressional approval for any military action. Many in Congress hail the act as a victory for democracy and a way to ensure no President may use military force for their own agenda or interests. In general, the bill has widespread public support, but the White House noted in such a fast-paced world of changing circumstances, the new law will hinder the ability of the United States to act effectively. Observers of the bill note the law has potential loopholes and time will tell whether the President can truly be challenged in times of crisis."

 NIC_USA.1.d:0 "The Sandinista National Liberation Front emerged from the merging of several youth and student groups at university campuses. The party increasingly espouses a socialist ideology in opposition to the ruling Somoza family. For many Nicaraguans, the Somoza regime has led to economic hardship, political repression, and a policy of capitulating to demands from the United States. The Sandinistas have grown in popularity in recent years due to blatant corruption and the failure of the government to deal with a recent earthquake disaster. The group has campaigned for higher wages and has launched several raids against the Somoza family and their supporters. The United States views the rise of this leftist organization with increasing suspicion and is backing the Nicaraguan government in its efforts to deal with the threat."
 NIC_USA.2.d:0 "The rise of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front and their campaign of kidnapping and fomenting unrest had enraged the Nicaraguan government led by long-term ruler Anastasio Somoza. The Somoza family itself had been ruling the country since the last American military intervention and have enjoyed decades of aid from the United States. The Nicaraguan government has unleashed a brutal campaign of killings and suppression to quell the unrest called the Siege Policy, but this has not ended the unrest. In fact, the scale of the violence has shocked the United States and although they oppose the Sandinistas as an alternative regime, it has been decided to suspend American aid to the Nicaraguan government and Somoza. The Somoza regime was quick to call the move a betrayal of an anti-communist ally, but the United States insists it cannot support the gross human rights violations occurring in Nicaragua."
 NIC_USA.3.d:0 "Following the kidnapping campaign of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front against the Nicaraguan government, its ruler decided to launch a Siege Policy. The long-term Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza has unleased his American trained National Guard to lead a campaign of extra judicial killings, violence, press censorship, and intimidation to target leftists across the country and prevent news from leaking abroad. Although many nations have already condemned this policy as perpetuating human rights abuses, the United States government has decided to endorse the Siege Policy. The American government cannot risk the socialist Sandinistas from coming to power and removing a key American ally. Indeed, an American official told media that the Nicaraguan government was defending itself and the people from communist terror, indicating its support for the Somoza regime."
 NIC_USA.4.d:0 "Pedro Chamorro was editor for the popular newspaper La Prensa, founder of a pro-democracy party, and the relative of two former Nicaraguan presidents. A group of gunmen pulled up to Chamorro in a car and opened fire, killing Chamorro. His death has sparked outrage across the country as the opposition blames the government of dictator Anastasio Somoza responsible for the killing. At his funeral, tens of thousands took to the street, leading to violence and riots targeting the Somoza regime. A general strike also shutdown most businesses for several days. The Somoza regime has blamed a local businessman upset at criticism from La Prensa but most people hold the government responsible."
 NIC_USA.5.d:0 "President Anastasio Somoza has officially resigned as President of Nicaragua. He and his family are said to have already fled, with many suspecting they are fleeing with millions in state assets. The fall of the Somoza regime has seen forces for the Sandinista National Liberation Front enter the capital. A new socialist regime under the Sandinistas is expected to take power as their forces currently control almost the entire country. The failure of Somoza to compromise on demands for reforms, address the decades long economic inequalities, and its use of repression facilitated their downfall. Many in Nicaragua are not mourning the fall of the Somoza family but there is uncertainty regarding what the future of Nicaragua holds."
 USA_NIC_WAR.1.d:0 "The United States military has invaded Nicaragua. This is the first direct military action in Nicaragua since the United States withdrew from the country in 1933. The rise of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front has threatened to turn Nicaragua into a socialist state. For the United States, having a socialist government so close to the continental United States and in a position to spread socialist unrest across is neighbors is seen as unacceptable. The American military stated its objective was to save the people of Nicaragua from an oppressive regime. It added it expected to be well-received by the people and did not anticipate heavy resistance. In neighboring states across the region, many have taken to the street to protest American military action. There are fears that the American intervention is a return to the American gunboat diplomacy of the early twentieth century."
 contra.1.d:0 "The new Sandinista government has started a program of socialist reform for the betterment of Nicaraguan society. However, there are those from the old regime who resist change. For decades these people profited from corruption and exploitation. On top of that, the United States is openly organizing these factions into armed militants in order to destroy the will of Nicaraguans. These militants are calling themselves Contras and are conducting operations against our Sandinista government. Our own sources tell us the Contras are being unified by foreign intelligence agencies and their goal is to destroy socialism in Nicaragua. As the Contras conduct more operations, they are gaining more support from sympathizers and are increasingly instilling fear in the hearts of many Nicaraguans."
 contra.2.d:0 "The collapse of the Somoza regime and the rise of the socialist Sandinistas marked a radical transformation of governance in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas initially promised to respect democracy and end the economic disparity across society. However, several factions of Nicaraguans have grown suspicious of the Sandinistas and believe they are instead building a communist society. These factions have organized into militant groups called Contras that are launching attacks against the Sandinistas. The Contras consist of three main groups, former Somoza regime supporters, anti-communists, and anti-Somozan fighters who feel they were lied to by the Sandinistas after they took power. The CIA is said to be unifying these Contra groups and supporting anti-Sandinista factions in Nicaragua. Many fear the rise of the Contras may lead to civil war and violence."
 USA_NIC.50.d:0 "For the first time since the early 1930s, United States marines have landed in force in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua. The American government had stated the marines would be focused on protecting the embassy and airport but reports from Managua indicate they are being deployed at key military checkpoints. This deployment greatly shores up Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza as he struggles to maintain power against socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front rebels. The Sandinista fighters had been making gains but with the American deployment many expect the tide may turn. President Somoza has been waging a brutal campaign against the Sandinistas, facing widespread international condemnation for human rights violations but the United States continues to consistently stand with him as an essential anti-communist bulwark."
 
 AST_CIA.1.d:0 "The current Australian Labor Party government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam has raised alarm bells with our government. Prime Minister Whitlam has suggested he would consider the possibility of shutting down American military bases in Australia. Such a scenario would be devastating to our interests in the South Pacific. The CIA however has a potential solution. They believe the current Australian Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, is sympathetic and understanding to the importance of an American military presence. One of our agents will approach the Governor-General and request he use his constitutional power to dismiss the weak Whitlam government and not only end the political deadlock in Australia but help in the global defense against communist influence."
 AST_CIA.2.d:0 "The current Australian Labor Party government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam has raised alarm bells with our government. Prime Minister Whitlam has suggested he would consider the possibility of shutting down American military bases in Australia. Such a scenario would be devastating to our interests in the South Pacific. We recently dispatched an agent to ask the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, to use his constitutional power to dismiss the government. Doing so would aid the current political issues plaguing Australia and protect our bases. However, this attempt to get the support of the Governor-General failed as he has decided against dismissing the government."
 AST_CIA.3.d:0 "In a shocking development, the political crisis in Australia boiled into the dramatic dismissal of the ruling Labor Party of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Although Whitman and the opposition appeared to be close to achieving a compromise, the Governor-General instead decided to take the drastic action of dismissing the government. The decision of the Governor-General certainly suits the interests of the United States and its fears that Whitman intended to remove American military bases from the country. The CIA privately is taking credit for convincing the Governor-General to act. Australians are said to be stunned by these actions and fear for the democratic future of the country. However, the new government insists it will hold elections soon and end the recent political turmoil."

 Diem_Coup.1.d:0 "South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu were brutally assassinated during a military coup launched by nationalist officers. A deeply devoted Catholic, the Diem regime struggled in recent years to deal with communist guerrillas operating in the countryside and resistance from the majority Buddhist population. Buddhists protesting the discriminatory policies by the Diem government were met military fire. After the coup plotters in the military isolated Diem from loyalist forces, they assaulted his residence, eventually capturing Diem and his brother who attempted to flee. Despite guarantees from the generals and the United States that Diem would receive safe passage out of the country, on his transportation to the military headquarters, Diem and his brother were bayoneted and shot by a junior officer. Many in the new ruling junta condemned the act but it remains unknown if the killing was accidental or ordered by the junta to hold power."
 PRC_UN.1.d:0 "\nThe UN General Assembly has passed Resolution 2578. 74 nations voted for; 35 nations voted against; 17 nations abstained. Resolution 2578 recognizes the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. Resolution 2578 gives the People's Republic of China UN member status and transfers the Republic of China's permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council to the People's Republic of China. The resolution also expelled Chiang Kai-shek's representative and revokes the Republic of China's UN member status. The Republic of China has constantly criticized Resolution 2578 as illegal, since the expulsion of a of a UN member requires the recommendation of the Security Council and can only occur if a nation has persistently violated the principles in the present chapter according to Article 6 of Chapter 2 of the United Nations Charter."
 PRC_UN.2.d:0 "During the 22nd UN General Assembly the United States vetoed Resolution 2578, which would recognize the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China. The United States's UN representative George H.W Bush has stated that Resolution 2578 was illegal, since the expulsion of a of a UN member requires the recommendation of the Security Council and can only occur if a nation has persistently violated the principles in the present chapter according to Article 6 of Chapter 2 of the United Nations Charter. George H.W Bush also stated that he proposed a draft for Resolution 2578 which would grant both UN member status and the Republic of China's permanent seat on the UN Security Council to the People's Republic of China, but the Republic of China would retain it's right of representation in the UN, however this draft was rejected by the UN General Assembly."
 USA_Secret_War.1.d:0 "The blockade of the Vietnamese coast virtually halted all smuggling of arms and supplies to communist guerrillas in South Vietnam. In response the North Vietnamese expanded the operations of the 559th Transportation Group which had established a series of trails from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. The rout was called the Ho Chi Minh Trail and sprawled from Vietnam into parts of Laos and Cambodia. Efforts by the United States to push the Cambodian and Laotian government to interrupt these supply lines failed. Frustrated about the increasingly infiltration of fighters into South Vietnam, the United States government has decided to start a bombing campaign. The operation seeks to target North Vietnamese forces, facilities, and supply routes in both Cambodia and Laos. This operation greatly expands the Vietnam War but American policy makers believe airpower can greatly hinder the North Vietnamese efforts and tiedown North Vietnamese forces who would otherwise head south."

 #Country Events
 Castro.1.d:0 "The Cuban government announced an attempt to assassinate President Fidel Castro was foiled. The government stated a team of imperialist thugs and traitors to the people attempted to take the life of Castro but were caught red handed. They added that any Cubans caught abetting or aiding the assassins would also be arrested and tried. Justice would be done in the name of the Cuban people. Although details were not provided, the Cuban government also stated they believed the plot to be one by American intelligence agents. The United States did not comment on the accusations of involvement in the attempt but did state these attempts demonstrate the desire of Cubans to be free of Castro and his oppressive regime."
 Castro.3.d:0 "Prior to the Cuban Revolution, American crime bosses owned casinos, hotels, and owned other valuable economic assets across Cuba. However, following the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro led a campaign to curb foreign access to Cuban assets and many American crime bosses lost millions. Today, an attempt to poison the food of Cuban leader Fidel Castro was discovered. Cuban security personnel quickly captured the group which delivered the poisoned dish to Castro and announced the plot was hatched by the American mafia. The Cuban government added the sophistication of the poison and the organization of the plan made them suspect the mafia was working closely with the American government. So far the United States has not commented on these accusations."
 CIA.7.d:0 "Operation HTLINGUAL, the examination of mail products exiting and entering The United States that are bound for Communist countries, has been approved for expansion by the CIA. Originally only intended to collect addresses and names from the exteriors of suspicious mail bound for countries such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The new CIA expansion has funded the opening of two new rigorous inspection centers in New York and Los Angeles to ensure the safety of the American People. While formerly created to obtain intelligence on overseas adversaries the CIA has also began keeping tabs on the mail of possible domestic troublemakers and activists such as Martin Luther King and John Steinbeck."
 usa_flavor.1.d:0 "Reports are flooding in from New York City, calls from reporters about the Stonewall Inn, a bar in the city's Greenwich Village, which serves as a haven for the city's gay, lesbian and transgender community. Despite how often we perform raids on gay bars, they're fighting back now. Two transgender women of color, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, were said to have resisted arrest and thrown the first bottle (or brick or stone) at the cops, respectively. The growing mob outside forced the original NYPD raiding group to barricade themselves, rioters outside pelting them with objects and trying to ram themselves inside. Finally, sometime after 4 a.m., things settled down. Amazingly, no one died or was critically injured on the first night of rioting, though a few police officers reported injuries.\n\nDespite having been torn apart by our officers, the Stonewall Inn opened before dark the next night. Again the police were called out to restore order, including an even larger group of TPF officers, who beat and tear gassed members of the crowd. This continued until the early hours of the morning, when the crowd dispersed.\n\nMore and more supporters showed up, chanting slogans like "gay power" and "we shall overcome." Over the next several nights, gay activists continued to gather near the Stonewall, taking advantage of the moment to spread information and build the community that would fuel the growth of the gay rights movement. Though police officers also returned, the mood was less confrontational, with isolated skirmishes replacing the large-scale riots of the weekend."

 USA_Rhodesia.2.d:0 "\nWith the Soviet Union and their clients across Africa causing unrest and seizing power in different places, there is renewed interest in Rhodesia. Since Rhodesia declared its unilateral independence, the United States stood with its ally Britain in cutting ties and establishing sanctions until Rhodesia accepts the principle of majority rule. However, the Rhodesians possess valuable minerals and are fighting a war against multiple militant groups claiming to fight for independence. However, their left-leaning ideology hints these groups may just be Soviet assets. South Africa and Portugal refuse to enforce the sanctions, allowing the Rhodesians to circumvent its impact on the country. Recently American intelligence, business interests, and white supremacists have begun using South Africa to engage in trade and arms sales with the Rhodesian. Although this is against official policy and blatant, Washington has so far refused to close the loophole, indicating a tacit approval."
 USA_Rhodesia.1.d:0 "In Washington, there is an increasing belief that the many leftist independent movements operating in Africa are communist fronts. These groups try to portray themselves as freedom fighters, but, they are just laying the groundwork for the future when they transform into totalitarian communist states. Nations like Rhodesia once vilified for its strong stance against such groups are now being portrayed as an anti-communist redoubt in Africa. Supporters of Rhodesia are lobbying the White House to ignore communist propaganda and recognize Rhodesia. They want Rhodesia to receive the support needed to continue their resistance to communism. When these advocates are pressed on Rhodesian race policies, they often state it is an internal matter for Rhodesians but one that can be changed overtime with the help of the United States."
 SOVUSA.1.d:0 "The United States, through a secret emissary, have offered to join the Soviet Union and defeat the PRC. The Americans state the Chinese government has proven to be unpredictable, violent, and a source of unrest across the world. Although they possess huge numbers and resources, a joint effort should find success. Some senior party leaders want to accept the proposal, stating American naval and airpower in particular could ensure a swift victory over Beijing. Others worry involving the United States will limit our post-war options as the Americans will insist their puppet regime in Taiwan take power after the war. Such a scenario could be devastating to our interests in Asia."
 SOVUSA.2.d:0 "We recently offered the USSR a proposal for us to join forces and defeat the PRC. The communist regime in Beijing has long been a threat to our interests in the region and more significantly, backing one communist regime to destroy another would only help our interests. However, the Soviet Union informed us they could not accept our proposal. Although they did not give reasons, it appears this is probably due to their fears that American involvement would limit their post-war options and perhaps they did not want their military closely working with ours. This is a disappointing outcome but can be expected considering the naked ambitions of global communism."
 SOVUSA.3.d:0 " We recently offered the USSR a proposal for us to join forces and defeat the PRC. The communist regime in Beijing has long been a threat to our interests in the region and more significantly, backing one communist regime to destroy another would only help our interests. After considering the proposals, the Soviets responded that they accept the proposal. The news was excitedly received in the White House, which quickly ordered the Pentagon to prepare the deployment of troops and assets. Already senor cabinet officials have opened contact with their Soviet counterparts along with senior military staff. Russian translators are being moved from other departments to the Pentagon to help this effort. America has achieved its objective and looks forward to punishing the PRC and asserting its interests in Asia."
 SOVUSA.4.d:0 "Much to the shock of their own domestic populations, the United States and Soviet Union announced it was commencing military actions against China. Both nations cited the brutality of the Beijing government and its involvement in stirring global unrest. News has already reached of Soviet ground forces crossing the border and rumors of American attacks are also coming in. The extent of military cooperation between the two countries is unknown, although both sides are communicating closely. Some suggest this contact is to ensure neither side accidentally targets the other. In Beijing the government was defiant, claiming China faced a national struggle against imperialism but unlike the earlier struggles, the people are ready. Chinese forces are mobilizing and pro-government marches are encouraging resistance and volunteers for the military. With the three most powerful states now at war, many across the globe fear the consequences of such a conflict."
 USA_COUP.1.d:0 "The founder of Indonesia and long-term leader President Sukarno has handed power over to General Suharto. It appears the Indonesian military forced Sukarno to give up power following a series of assassinations against Indonesian military leaders by a mysterious new communist militant group. The militants tried to force Sukarno to endorse their actions, but he refused and as the military cracked down on the radical militants, Sukarno was removed. Suharto has blamed the militant attack as a communist coup attempt and has ordered a crackdown on the Indonesian communist party. It appears the crackdown is violent with reports of killings and heavy fighting between military units and communists. The government is also arresting thousands of suspected communists across the country. It appears the new Indonesian military government is focused on removing communism from political life. The United States is offering intelligence and military aid to support the government in its anti-communist drive."
 latam_coup.1.d:0 "After months of social unrest, especially between the President and miners, the Bolivian military has stepped in and overthrown the government. The Vice President, Rene Barrientos led the effort and has taken power with military backing. Many in Bolivia suggest the coup occurred with American backing. Those who believe this theory point out the United States has economic interests in the country and were growing concerned with the political unrest. With this in mind, America feared an uprising or political shift towards communism and encouraged the military coup. The United States government for its part welcomed the new regime as a stabilizing force and ignored questions on any involvement with the coup."
 CIA_60s.3.d:0 "President Julio Arosemena Monroy tumultuous term as President of Ecuador ended with a military coup. The new Military Junta has declared it opposes communism and its recent spread in Latin America. Opponents to the coup and leftists are being detained and the Junta promises to initiate reforms aimed at alleviating the current economic and political issues plaguing Ecuador. President Monroy had initiated reforms but ran into trouble with the military and legislature by openly praising leftist movements. Recently he began criticizing the regional policies of the United States and insulted its ambassador. Many in the country believe these latest actions pushed the Americans to give their quiet approval to the military action."

 
 #Needs Coded
 Paris_Peace.1.d:0 "The Paris Peace Accords were signed between the United States, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and rebel forces in South Vietnam. The United States was quick to call the agreement a lasting peace for all in the region. The United States agreed to withdraw all its forces from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in addition to removing its blockade on North Vietnam. North Vietnam will release its American prisoners and promise not to send more troops or arms to South Vietnam rebels. North Vietnamese and their allies are allowed to remain in their territories in South Vietnam where they will establish ceasefire lines with the Saigon government. The reaction in South Vietnam to the treaty has been very negative, many calling the allowing of North Vietnamese infiltrators in the South as unacceptable and blaming the United States for coercing the government to agree to its terms to facilitate their withdrawal from the region."
 Camp_David.1.d:0 "After almost two weeks of intense negotiations, the leaders of Egypt and Israel signed a comprehensive peace treaty at the White House lawn. The American government spearheaded this recent effort following a recent thaw in Egyptian-Israeli relations. The two-week negotiations took place at the Presidential retreat at Camp David. Two documents were signed by both leaders. One offered a framework to regional peace, calling for a self-governing Palestinian zone in the West Bank and Gaza. The other document was far more comprehensive and resolved decades of tension between Egypt and Israel. The Sinai will be returned to Egypt in exchange for security guarantees, recognizing Israel, and normalized diplomatic ties. Despite widespread international praise, there has been angry backlash from Arab states and the Palestinians. They have accused Egypt of betraying Arab unity and were especially critical of the first document as it was written without consultation of other regional Arab states or Palestinians."
 Vietnam_War_2.1.d:0 "The United States signed the Paris Accords with every intention of following them through and engage in a spirit of peace with all factions. However, it is clear the North Vietnamese and their allies have taken advantage of our honor and are not living up to the agreement. Because of this, the United States has decided to initiate new military operations. As long as the communists continue to subvert the innocent people of South Vietnam the United States cannot stand idly by. The American people may not completely support our actions, but America has an obligation and duty to the people of Vietnam. We will not halt until the communists stop their senseless aggression."
 SEATO.4.d:0 "Following the recent successes on the battlefield against communist forces, SEATO headquarters announced an expansion of its members. SEATO emerged in the 1950s as a regional organization meant to facilitate cultural, trade, and military ties for nations with an interest of preventing the spread of communism to the region. The nations involved in the Indochina conflict largely stayed away due to their own international agreements preventing their joining, however, several joined as observers. These observer states have now announced their intention to join the organization as the United States pledged to strengthen the organization and promised that SEATO will be the vanguard of anti-communism forces in the region."
 SEATO.5.d:0 " SEATO emerged in the 1950s as a regional organization meant to facilitate cultural, trade, and military ties for nations with an interest of preventing the spread of communism to the region.  In recent years the organization has declined as some members refused to involve themselves in Vietnam and the organization failed to attract many nations from Southeast Asia. With the situation in Vietnam deteriorating and American involvement largely diminished, it was decided to formally disband the group as it no longer has a clear purpose. Although SEATO did not live up to its military potential and will no longer function, the regional connections it fostered will be the lasting legacy of the organization."
 US_Taiwan.10.d:0 "Following the recent thawing of relations between the United States and the PRC, the American government announced it will withhold all aid to Taiwan, effective immediately. The American government cites the changing regional situation and a desire to not contribute to enflaming tensions in the region. Significantly, America will now view the Taiwan dispute as an internal issue that must be dealt with by the two governments. Already the announcement has provoked congressional anger and media outrage in America with many calling the decision a betrayal of a staunch, anti-communist ally. However, the American government insists the decision is in the best interest of the country and not done to appease the any foreign state."
 USA_Afghanistan.1.d:0 "The United States strongly condemns the recent military actions undertaken by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. They call the Soviet invasion illegal, a violation of the Afghan people, and an attack on world peace. In Washington the Soviet ambassador was called to the White House where he was given an official protest. The strong response by the United States was expected but whether this will lead to any involvement in the ongoing conflict is currently unknown. The Secretary of State has already called his counterparts in the region who have also expressed concern over the Soviet action. The Soviet government in response has stated it has acted in the interests of the Afghan people and from the invitation of its government."
 Grain_Embargo.1.d:0 "In an escalation to the American response to the invasion of Afghanistan, the United States announced it will embargo all grain exports to the Soviet Union. The United States hopes the embargo will lead to shortages in the Soviet Union that will push its people to force the government to stop its operations. Although the move is being applauded across America, many experts believe the Soviets will be able to find alternative sources and mitigate its effect. The American government says this decision is part of a multifaceted diplomatic campaign to push the Soviets to end its involvement in Afghanistan."
 US_Olympics.1.d:0 "As part of its multifaceted approach to protesting and diplomatically challenging the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, America announced it will boycott the 1980 Olympics to be held in Moscow. In addition, the United States requested all its allies and nations supporting world peace to join them in the boycott. Almost immediately several states have expressed an interest in supporting the move. The idea to boycott the games emerged from Soviet dissidents who felt such an action would demonstrate global resolve against Soviet aggression. Although the move has gained initial international and domestic support, there are many in the country who feel sports should be separated from politics. In addition, diplomats from some nations have privately told media outlets they feel such a move would be an empty gesture and they do not plan on joining the boycott."
 Sandinista.1.d:0 "The American government publicly denounced the Sandinistas of Nicaragua for their brutal tactics and outrages against the people of Nicaragua. The United States noted Central America has long been an interest to the country and Americans have long sought to aid its people over the years. The Sandinistas represent an existential threat to the Nicaraguan people and the values of its people. The strong condemnation from the United States has raised fears of more American involvement in Nicaragua, though the anti-Sandinista forces in the country welcome the announcement. The Sandinistas in response stated they are fighting for the peasants and workers of Nicaragua and will not bow to imperialist pressure."
 Khomenei_Assasinated.1.d:0 "In an escalation to the brutal suppression unleased by the Shah of Iran against dissidents in the country, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was assassinated. The longtime critic of the Shah had fled the country years earlier and became a symbol of opposition to the Shah. The details of the assassination are still vague, but blame is already being placed on the Shah and his secret police, the SAVAK. The death of Khomeini will be a major blow to the opposition. Already waves of protests from Iranian dissidents and Khomeini supporters are occurring in Europe, Iran, and neighboring states. The blame on the Shah has extended to his ally the United States, with many believing SAVAK acted in conjunction with the CIA. The American government has so far remained silent on the news, though many believe the recent crackdown on dissidents only occurred with the blessing of the United States."
 Oil_Embargo.79.d:0 "Iranian oil production has greatly reduced following the unrest which continues to shake the country. Adding to this pressure is the constant strikes plaguing the Iranian oil industries. This has led to a global panic in regard to energy supply. Adding to this uncertainty is the recent announcement by the American government that it will embargo Iranian oil for the foreseeable future due to their continued defiance of international norms and their hostility to the United States. The President emphasized the measures will punish Iran and arrangements were made to mitigate its effect on the United States, however, the announcement fueled more consumer panic which is hurting economic growth and driving the price of oil up. The Iranian government called this latest announcement an empty gesture by America."
 USA_Rhodesia.3.d:0 "In a controversial move, the American government announced it would recognize the independence of Rhodesia. Like many other nations, the United States previously refused to recognize Rhodesia over its racial policies and unilateral declaration of independence from its ally, Great Britain. However, the rise of communism in Africa has led to a new evaluation by American policy makers. They believe supporting effective anti-communist regimes in the continent will be the most effective way to stop communism. Rhodesia in particular has been exceptionally efficient at resisting leftist guerrilla armies despite a lack of access to Western aid or weapons. The controversial Rhodesian race laws are now to be ignored and treated as an internal affair of Rhodesia. However, the announcement provoked angry protests in the US and abroad. Many condemn the racial policies and view the rebels as freedom fighters, not communists. The extent of American support for Rhodesia is not yet known."
 USA_Portugal.1.d:0 "As part of a new shift in American policy towards Africa, the United States has pledged it will do all it can to preserve the Portuguese position in Africa. Many American policy makers now view the rising number of leftist guerrilla forces fighting for independence as essentially communist forces bent on turning the continent communist. To lose those areas, populations, and resources to the communist world could potentially cripple the American position internationally. The Portuguese and their allies are among the most efficient forces on the ground battling these groups which has led the United States to support them and change its position on decolonization in Africa. The new shift in policy is leading to international and domestic backlash. Many equating the new policy as an active endorsement against decolonization and approval of racial discrimination, which will ultimately isolate America internationally."

 #Iranian Hostage Crisis
 IHC.1.d:0 "In an unprecedent escalation, hundreds of Iranian student protestors seized control of the United States embassy in Tehran. After a brief struggle, the ambassador surrendered. The embassy staff and marines were blindfolded and paraded in front of media cameras. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has endorsed the takeover and the hostages are being held by his supporters. The United States and many other states were quick to condemn this breach of international law. So far, the hostage takers are demanding the Shah of Iran be returned from the United States where he has sought asylum and is undergoing medical treatment. The hostage takers have also seized documents from the embassy which they plan to publicly release to show American involvement in the crimes of the Shah."
 IHC.5.d:0 "As we consider our options to confront Iran, it has been decided that future military operations will be done solely with the aid of NATO. At NATO headquarters, the Americans activated article 5 stating the attack on its embassy was an assault on American sovereign territory. Many NATO members have expressed support for the United States in this trying time. In Washington, there is a broad consensus that if America must act, it must do so with its closest allies. If NATO cannot help, then it would imply the entire American security arrangement is bankrupt. If it comes to war, America will go to it with or without the support of its closest allies."
 IHC.10.d:0 "The United States of America announced its forces were moving from bases in the region to swiftly neutralize the Iranian government. The American President informed the American people that the cause was just and to leave Iran unpunished after it ignored the ultimatum would weaken the country and cause the friends of the United States to question American conviction. The President cited the violations of international laws and human rights abuses as justification for military action. America promises to restore a proper and just government for the Iranian people. Although the invasion so far appears to be going as planned, the size of Iran and its population are raising concerns that a large American presence could provoke major unrest and challenges. Iranian activists opposed to the new regime are said to be cooperating with American intelligence to help facilitate the invasion."
 IHC.15.d:0 "With the hostage negotiations stalling on the excessive Iranian demands and their lack of wiggle room, the President has been approached regarding a military solution to the crisis.  The American special forces and intelligence agencies state they know the hostages are still being held at the embassy and propose an operation that would surgically rescue the hostages and not involve a full-on military assault on Iran. The plan involves US forces establishing an airfield in Iran to be a staging ground. Once that is established, nearly a hundred special forces soldiers will arrive and launch an aerial assault on the embassy. Once the hostages are free, they will be flown out of Iran along with our forces. Although it is a complex operation, the military appears confident and states it will not likely provoke a wider conflict."
 IHC.16.d:0 "The American people were overjoyed to hear news of the successful rescue of American hostages in Iran. Despite some minor fuel issues, the two-night American operation succeeded in first establishing an airbase within Iran, from which American special forces flew in helicopters to assault the embassy and rescue the hostages. The assault when according to plan, with Iranian resistance much lighter than anticipated, it appears they were completely unaware such an operation could even be done. There are no known casualties, but the news is still early. The Iranian mistake had been to keep the hostages together, which made the operation possible. Iranian military attempts to intercept the raiders failed as the temporary American airfield was long empty by the time they reached them. The operation is a huge victory for American special forces and showcases that America will not tolerate being blackmailed by any state or organization, no matter where they are located."
 IHC.17.d:0 "The White House announced that an attempt to free the American hostages being held in Iran has failed. Although the details are still being ascertained, it appears American military personnel did lose their lives, though the hostages remain unharmed. The mission had was called off after the initial phase of the operation ended in disaster. Although the airstrip was established in Iran, there were fuel issues and increment weather which saw the crashing of at least one transport plane and one helicopter. The remaining forces were frantically evacuated, and several aircraft were left abandoned. No personnel were lost to enemy combat and Iran is already calling the failed operation as sign from God. The American people are said to be despondent from the news and morale in the military has taken a hit. In Iran, the hostages are now being dispersed across the country to ensure a similar attempt cannot occur."
 IHC.20.d:0 "The people of the United States have closely followed developments since mobs of Iranian students seized American embassy staff as hostages in Tehran. After a long ordeal, the Iranian government officially released the hostages, allowing them to fly out of the country. After making several stops along the way, to allow military medical staff to check on their health, the freed Americans landed at a military airfield in New York. The former hostages were then bused to the Thayer Hotel at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Throughout the bus route, crowds of Americans cheered the former hostages. After three days, they will be taken to New York for a ticker-tape parade. The families of the former hostages are jubilant to have their loved ones back. For the American government, there is satisfaction and a sigh of relief that the situation has finally been resolved with the hostages safe return."

 #IHC Country Events
 IHC.2.d:0 "Iran has formally opened negotiations with the United States over the American embassy hostages they have. Through Panama they officially requested the return of the Shah to face his crimes against the Iranian people. The American government has refused on humanitarian grounds, stating his weak health and ongoing medical treatments. The Iranians are demanded America apologize for its previous interferences in Iranian internal affairs and an unfreezing of Iranian state funds held by the US. For the Americans, although the release of the Shah is not on the table, they are willing to negotiate further on the other demands, including the potential of a commission to investigate American involvement in Iranian affairs. However, the hostage takers appear quite dedicated and whether the Iranian government can even compromise on their demands appears unlikely."
 IHC.3.d:0 "The recent Iranian provocation and seizing of hostages from the United States embassy has outraged the American people. As a result, the American government has decided that it will not reward such a wanton violation of international law and American sovereignty. It has ruled out any negotiations with Iran and instead has issued an ultimatum demanding the unconditional release of the hostages. In response, the reaction from the Iranian students holding the hostage has been clear defiance, however, it is unknown if the government will be as defiant with the deadline. Many Americans are applauding the strong stance by the government, though there are many who caution such an aggressive stance may put the hostages in much greater risk."
 IHC.4.d:0 "The American government has recently sent a proposal to our government. They have asked us to join an Anti-Iranian Pact and help them remove the new regime in Tehran. In exchange they have offered to withdraw all their support to the Afghan opposition fighting our forces in Afghanistan. Some of our advisors suggest the offer might be fruitful. Ending the Afghan resistance will be a huge benefit and the theocratic nature of the new regime may pose a threat to our own Muslim population. Other advisors, however, note the new regime so far appears to want cordial ties and the previous regime had long been a thorn on our side. Replacing the current regime with another pro-American one may end up posing a greater threat to our interests than the Afghan opposition could ever hope to be. We must think carefully on this American proposal."

 #VFX Program Event Chain
 VFX.1.d:0 "The concept for VFX, our Navy Fighter Experiment began in 1968 when Grumman submitted an unsolicited aircraft proposal. Interested by this, the Chief of Naval Operations recommended a study be made to determine the feasibility of the VFX design. The study came to the conclusion that the new fighter design was feasible and the Navy proceeded with contract definition, five companies submitted their designs, companies such as Grumman, General Dynamics, Vought, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell. What an exciting time to be an aircraft designer! We will chose two finalists and choose from there. We want an aircraft with a crew of two persons, a powerful on-board weapon control radar, capability for long range air to air combat (over 100 miles), it must be a twin-engined interceptor and have a top speed of Mach 2.2. It should also have an M61 Vulcan, and be able to carry six AIM-54s or six AIM-7s and four AIM-9s."
 VFX.2.d:0 "After many interesting designs from many companies, we have boiled down to two manufacturers, the contract either goes to McDonnell Douglas, famous creators of the F-4 Phantom, an extremely reliable aircraft we used during Vietnam, or we award the contract to Grumman, with their revolutionary 303 design. There have been some pressure from within the Navy for McDonnell Douglas to be chosen, as there's definitely a bit of a bias towards them when it comes to naval aviation. Grumman hasn't been known for making great jet fighters, let alone interceptors since they made the F9F Panther, and it's upgraded variant the Cougar."
 VFX.3.d:0 "We have chosen Grumman for the VFX competition and will award them the contract for producing our new interceptor, the F-14. Grumman's work on the VFX began with the study of the "303" concept. Despite their involvement in the failed F-111B from the TFX competition, Grumman used their experience in aircraft making to create the design that ended up winning the competition. The Model 303 came in a number of different variants, both fixed and swing-wing. The aircraft has two General Electric afterburning turbofan engines, it's capable of Mach 2.34, can carry an amazing air to air weapons payload and has met all of our criteria."
 VFX.4.d:0 "We have chosen McDonnell Douglas for the contract of our new interceptor, the F-14. McDonnell Douglas proposed possibly the most ambitious VFX design. Like three of the other four designs, their proposal featured variable geometry wings. They also incorporated canards into the design, as well as a double tail. The wings were mounted low on the aircraft, while engines dominated the fuselage. The fuselage was rather boxy and not aerodynamic, it provided a large space to mount missiles. The ambitious proposal gained favor due to the anticipated good maneuverability that the canards and twin-tails lent themselves to. The design was one of the two finalist designs selected for further development, and in the end, McDonnell Douglas has come out on top over Grumman."
