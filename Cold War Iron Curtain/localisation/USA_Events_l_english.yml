The CIA had only come to this conclusion after Velasco's stubborn resistance and opposition to the USA's policy of breaking ties with Communist Cuba and suppression of Leftist and Communist activities at home. The CIA has infiltrated the structure of Political Organizations within Ecuador ranging across the political scale, directing all citizens away from support of Communists in Cuba and Anti-American views. It has also began electronic monitoring of Sensitive Frequencies in Ecuador. With all essential information required, acquired, the CIA moved forward with the removal of Velasco from the Office of Ecuadorian President. With the force of the Ecuadorian Military on the CIA's side Velasco had no choice but to surrender power. Velasco has been replaced with his Vice President, Carlos Arosemena, a figure more lenient to American Policies."

After the KKK set up in a sympathetic farmer's field the Lumbee men encircled the KKK and proceeded to yell and attack the KKK while shooting at the Klansmen, the Klansmen attempted to return fire but failed and ended up in 4 Klansmen being wounded and the rest fleeing leaving their family, their public address system, and an unlit cross. With Roberson County deputies deputies and sheriffs breaking up the celebration by the Lumbee with tear gas grenades."
 book_releases.1.d:0 "On June 8th, 1949, George Orwell published the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Set in the distant year of 1984, it focuses on three megalithic states and their constant, shifting war on each other and on their own people. During the early 1950s, the United Kingdom becomes involved in a third World War, this time involving nuclear weapons like used over Japan in 1945. Britain falls to civil war, with the authoritarian English Socialist Party, or Ingsoc, emerging victorious. In the authoritarian state, thoughts are policed, history is revised, and a cult of personality to the mustachioed Big Brother reigns supreme."
 kef.2.d:0 "The Golden Age of Comic Books in the USA lasted from 1938 to 1945 and its end saw the sharp decline of superhero comics. New genres, such as crime and horror comics, have sparked outrage with allegations that these comics inspire illegal behaviour among minors, known as Juvenile Delinquency. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency was tasked by the Senate to investigate these allegations. The infamous Comic Book Hearings took place on April 21st, 22nd and June 4th 1954, and had a profound effect on the future of comic books, with the taste of graphic images in the comics being brought into question. The publishing of the book ‘Seduction of the Innocent' has galvanized public opinion against comic books and given the industry unfavorable press coverage, effectively forcing them to adopt the Comics Code Authority, enforcing self-censorship upon themselves and resulting in the harsh censorship or even cancellation of many long-standing comic series. The ramifications of this are yet to be fully felt, but it's already clear that this is a devastating blow for the already struggling American comic book industry."
 little_rock.1.d:0 "In a historic series of events, nine African-American students have been admitted to Little Rock Central High school under protection of the 101st Airborne Division. After the Brown vs Board case, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People registered nine students for attendance at the Little Rock Central High school: Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls, who soon became known as the Little Rock Nine. Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas called in the National Guard to prevent them from attending and images of their plight were spread across world media, bringing in major international attention. After the Guard was removed following legal action and the police took over, mass rioting and protests forced them to remove the students. Following this, President Eisenhower made the Momentous decision to deploy 1,200 men of the 101st Airborne Division to ensure the students attended safely. Despite suffering constant harassment throughout the year, this turn of events represents a significant stride in desegregation efforts across the US and, occurring only a year after the Bus Boycott in Alabama, could help lead to greater rights for African-Americans in the southern states."
 kef.10.d:0 "Massive amounts of arrests and investigations were done today, as the federal government declared a national crackdown on juvenile delinquents, citing the rapid increase of youth related crimes over the past decade. According to the Department of Justice, the amount of youth related crimes has exacerbated over the years. As such, law and order cannot be maintained, and juvenile delinquents have been given lax treatment by the judicial system. Civil rights organizations condemn this act, for it preys on the rights of the youth, and is very prone to abuse."
 kef.7.d:0 "The American Medical Association has come under fire today, as recent reports circulate that its donors, mostly big pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, have influenced its policies and lobbying agendas, making them complicit in corruption and conflicts of interest scandal. The scandal, involving the highest echelons of the organization, were recently given vast sums of donations, half of it goes to themselves and half goes to the organization, in return for favors and influence in the organization's policy. The American Medical Association has yet to respond, but observers state that it would far reaching consequences in the future."
 kef.3.d:0 "President of the United States Estes Kefauver has recently been praised by various civil rights organizations, as the President is embarking on a massive civil rights campaign, calling for the empowerment of minorities and their integration to American society. In a privileged speech, Kefauver said that it is the obligation of the American people to treat everyone equally, regardless of race, religion, sexuality, and other aspects, and judge people solely on a person's character rather than skin color. This however has seen backlash by various white supremacist groups throughout the country, condemning his actions and demand an immediate retraction."
 sab_army_mc.1.d:0 "The McCarthy Hearings have been suspended until further notice today, as recent evidence showing the incompetence of various military officials in said hearings, virtually giving them no right to judge Joseph McCarthy, one of Washington's most prominent senators who has come under controversy for releasing documents pertaining to alleged communist officials in the US Government. This development is a major victory for the Senator, as he can finally continue his so-called 'crusade against communism', a phrase coined by his various supporters. Observers say that should McCarthy continue such crusade, we will be looking at not only a more anti-communist America, but a more undemocratic America."
 cultural_events.9.d:0 "The world community saw the passing of one of it's great, unsung protectors today as English cryptographer Alan Turing was found dead in what appears to be an act of suicide; Doctor Turing, 41, is considered to be the forefather of modern computer science and played no small role in the cracking of "Enigma" the Nazi German navel codes, a key role that aided the allied war effort in the Battle of the Atlantic among others; he is believed to be potentially responsible for saving upwards of 14 million lives and even shortening the length of the second world war by as long two years, The British government has been quick to distance themselves from the death of Turing, however, homosexual laws in the British Isles being what they are, Turing had been forced to stand trial for the crime of being a homosexual and the cryptographer was sentenced to chemical castration not ten years before his untimely passing.\nWhatever controversy that haunted Turing in life, in death, he shall be remembered as the spearhead into the heart of the Axis war machine and a pivotal figure in saving Britain, Europe, and, indeed, the world from fascism and tyranny."
 kef.8.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American president Estes Kefauver has publicly denounced the Southern Manifesto. Signed in March 1956 in response to Brown vs Board, it is the main base of Southern opposition to increasingly persistent federal efforts at desegregation. His speech was met with reactions varying from praise to accusations of treason, even by members of his own Democratic party. With the president committing himself to the cause of desegregation, tensions with the those who advocate for maintaining the status quo have increased considerably. Kefauver himself now faces widespread opposition from Dixiecrat influences in his party, although this is partially offset by increasing support from those sympathetic to the civil rights movement. One thing that is certain, however, is that the process of desegregating American society has been greatly sped up by these developments - and the south may have to embrace the winds of change blowing their way."
 phi_events.2.d:0 "Violence and civil unrest run rampant throughout Manila and the entirety of the Philippine archipelago, as various student activists, civic groups, and opposition factions, most of which have direct links to the Communist Party of the Philippines, have been organizing demonstrations and protests condemning the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and his supposed American masters. Reports have circulated that these demonstrations have rapidly escalated to large scale violence, as these demonstrators have already attacked various government districts, such as Mendiola, which is near proximity to Malacanang Palace, the official residence of the President, and the American embassy, which according to the militants is the de facto seat of power in the Philippines. In response to such acts of violence, President Ferdinand Marcos mobilized the Philippine Constabulary and broke up the demonstrations violently, if necessary. With the rapid increase in civil unrest, along with the Communist threat reaching the academia, observers predict that the Marcos government will institute radical measures to quell rebellion and the Communist threat."
 phi_events.3.d:0 "On September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos has just signed Proclamation No. 1081, a presidential proclamation declaring Martial Law throughout the entire Philippine archipelago. According to President Marcos, Martial Law was declared due to the decay of law and order, along with the ever growing threat of Communism which has gained rapid momentum, claiming that they are in the final works of a revolutionary uprising against his government. Opposition groups claim however that the vast majority of terrorist attacks experienced by the Philippines were orchestrated by the President's inner circle of military generals to promote fear and terror amongst the populace, thereby giving legitimacy to his declaration. Nevertheless, the implementation of Martial Law was swift, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP, able to secure strategic areas detrimental to the Marcos regime, and the implementation of the 'General Orders' placed on the proclamation. Observers are mixed with their response to this declaration, as some sympathize with the government, while others criticize it, believing in the story of the opposition."
 kef.9.d:0 "In a decisive move by President Kefauver of the United States, the process for nominating Democratic candidates has been radically altered to increase the effectiveness of the manner in which Democratic presidential candidates are selected. Traditionally, candidates were selected primarily in secret by party leaders, sometimes resulting in the selection of candidates who had never run as a delegate in a primary election. The President has put forward guidelines on how candidates should be selected, swiftly modernising the nomination process to take into account the will of the people and effectively forcing states to select their delegates via Presidential Primaries. The result of this reform is that the Democratic voters have a much larger role in the outcome than they had previously, and the move has taken a significant amount of power out of the hands of powerful politicians and into the hands of the people. It's now clear that the future Democratic candidates will represent the people more than they did in previous elections. Whether this will have an effect on future elections remains to be seen."

 adlai_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. In a shocking move by President Adlai Stevenson, he has refused to enforce the act and stated that he intends to allow any schools that wish to retain educational segregation to do so. This decision has prompted great outrage from Liberal elements within the Democratic Party and there are scattered calls for the impeachment of the President. However, it seems unlikely any of these calls will come to fruition, and the South's position as well as that of the segregationist movement has been greatly strengthened."
 truman_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the southern states, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Truman has always been known as being in favour of civil rights, passing the very first legislation desegregating the military in 1948. To no surprise, Truman has announced before congress his intentions to immediately enforce the ruling throughout the country. While causing considerable unrest in the south, actual resistance has been limited. Despite scattered calls for his impeachment by Dixiecrats within the Democratic Party, no solid base of opposition has formed, and it appears that the President will face no considerable political threats in the near future. How the southern states will handle these rapid changes and adapt to the new political climate remains a matter of contention."
 kef.6.d:0 "In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration was founded in 1906 to promote public health through the regulation of food safety and various medical instruments. With laws relating to public health constantly being updated, calls to empower the FDA have intensified since the end of World War 2, and following Kefauver's election to the presidency he has appeared somewhat willing to implement reforms to further expand the FDA's power. Recently, the President has proposed legislation to radically expand the FDA's authority in public health affairs, and today the changes have been officially ratified by Congress. With the bill coming into effect in the following days, the changes will likely be a major factor in the ongoing fight for the improvement of public health, although the changes have drawn criticism from those arguing against what they perceive as too much government intervention in the lives of American citizens."

Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Kefauver has always been known as a crusader for civil rights and, only a day after the ruling was handed down, has announced before congress his intentions to ‘uphold the ruling wherever possible'. While only a short speech, this represents a major stride for the civil rights movement in the United States and appears to be a decisive turning point for segregation in America."
 kef.1.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American President Estes Kefauver has officially declared war on the Italian-American mafia, vowing to root them out and ‘restore order' to American cities. Originating mainly from descendants of Italian immigrants, the mafia rose to prominence during the prohibition era and remain active in many industrial American cities, such as Chicago, operating a vast and well-organised criminal network. Before his rise to the presidency, Kefauver presided over hearings in 1950 that brought nationwide attention to the growing issue of organised crime, and following his election to the presidency many have expected him to take legal action regarding the issue. Until now, the mafia have faced relatively little opposition from law enforcement in building their criminal empire, but it now appears that this will soon change. Reactions to the President's speech have been varied, however there seems to be a distinct contrast between those strongly in favour of clamping down on organised crime and those who predict the drastic consequences a conflict with the mafia may have on the societies of areas in the direct vicinity of the inevitable conflict. Several congressmen have even suggested that it may be too hard to completely root out the well-established mafia and would only lead to further conflict, anger and damage within urban communities. Regardless of the consequences, this ambitious move will have significant long-term consequences to the lives of many, but whether the attempts will bear fruit remains unforeseeable."
 adlai_civil.2.d:0 "Many conservative southern voters split from the Democrat Party in 1948 to form the Dixiecrat Party, however they performed poorly in the 1948 elections and many returned to the Democrats, causing the end of the Dixiecrats. Following the election of President Adlai Stevenson, many former Dixiecrats have been emboldened by the president's pro-segregationist policies and their influence within the party has grown rapidly. Throughout his term, more vocal Dixiecrats have openly advocated for the president to take further steps to protect southern traditions, and make sure Jim Crow laws are upheld in the south. Recently, pressure on the President from Dixiecrats within the party have intensified, causing many internal issues for the President and pressuring him into action. In response to this pressure, President Adlai has announced before congress his intention to uphold Jim Crow laws in the southern states. This move immediately prompted protests amongst civil rights supporters and many have voiced concerns over the implications of this on the treatment of African-Americans in the south. With the president bowing to Dixiecrat interests, it seems the desegregation movement has suffered a major setback."

Though this meeting was brief, its importance in forwarding diplomacy between western democracies and eastern communist states is doubtless.

 Department_of_Energy.1.d:0 "The federal government recently approved the establishment of a Department of Energy. This will be a cabinet position and seeks to consolidate the various energy programs across the federal government with the defense responsibilities related to the nuclear program. For years energy policy, especially research has been hampered by a lack of focus due to the different programs and agencies involved. Even more significantly, the nuclear program has also been uncoordinated, especially in terms of design, production, and research. With the Department of Energy, all these programs and policies will be coordinated, and the government expects a great improvement in how effectively the United States will be able to develop new energy technologies and implement them across the country."
 Abolish_JCNAE.1.d:0 "The United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was officially abolished. At its peak, the committee held jurisdiction over all bills and regulations related to the military and civilian aspects of nuclear power. It also enjoyed a unique legislative veto that allowed it a voice in executive decision making over nuclear policy. Indeed, it was considered to be one of the most powerful congressional committees in American history. However, over recent years, its jurisdiction and oversight had been greatly reduced due to other senate and congressional committees taking on the oversight of civilian nuclear energy. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency and the establishment of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also made the committee increasingly redundant. With these factors in mind, the committee was formally abolished today in what many see as a victory for the executive branch and its efforts to consolidate nuclear policy in the executive branch." #Abolishment of the Joint Committee on Nuclear on Atomic Energy
 Ford.5.d:0 "President Gerald Ford today announced Nelson Rockefeller, the former governor of New York, as his candidate for Vice President. The decision to select Rockefeller saw immediate backlash among conservative Republicans who felt President Ford was betraying the values of the party by selecting a liberal Republican. Indeed, the congressional confirmation hearings are expected to be grueling as even conservative Democrats are expected to ask tough questions. However, his confirmation is expected to be achieved in the end. Upon making his announcement, President Ford, pointed out the executive experience Rockefeller has and his track record of successfully implementing policy. Observers note that Rockefeller may prove to be a major electoral asset for Ford in the next presidential election. Rockefeller can attract support from communities traditionally opposed to conservative Republicans and his inclusion as Vice President will broaden the appeal of Ford."
 Ford.6.d:0 "President Gerald Ford today announced before Congress that the greatest threat facing the country was inflation. He announced the launch of a new campaign called Whip Inflation Now (WIN) as a voluntary movement for American citizens to come together and battle inflation at home in coordination with his public measures for inflation control. President Ford stated he would also welcome letters from Americans with suggestions on controlling spending at home. The White House later announced those who participate in WIN should wear pins and shirts with WIN written to show solidarity. In addition, this program fits with the belief that it is up to private citizens working with the government to solve the current inflation crisis, not a bigger government. Initial reaction to WIN has been one of ridicule by many Americans and opponents to the President are manipulating the logo to turn into criticisms of the President."
 Ford.7.d:0 "In a nationally televised address to the nation, newly appointed President Gerald Ford announced he was pardoning former President Richard Nixon. President Ford stated the United States needed to move on and heal from the recent controversies and the only way it will end is through the presidential pardon. Former President Nixon resigned over the Watergate Scandal and the recent release of compromising White House recordings. The decision to pardon President Nixon has not been well received. Opponents accuse Ford of colluding with Nixon to elevate himself to President while others suggest Nixon should have faced the consequences for his actions. Political observers note the reputation of President Ford as an honest broker will be hit by this decision. However, supporters of the President insist his decision was not the result of a political deal but the morally correct thing to do and he will take the political backlash in order to heal the nation."
 Albert.1.d:0 "President Carl Albert announced he would confirm the appointment of Gerald Ford as his Vice President. The decision to keep a Republican Vice President is seen as a conciliatory act considering the extraordinary circumstances which led to President Albert assuming his office. Gerald Ford is seen as a moderate Republican with a strong moral character that Democrats and Republicans both respect. President Albert stated he looked forward to working closely with Vice President Ford. Although the press largely supported the decision of President Albert, there were grumblings among Democrats who fear Vice President Ford, a close friend of the former President Richard Nixon, may use his position to undermine proceedings against him."
 Albert.2.d:0 "The trial of former President Richard Nixon concluded in his conviction earlier today. While in office, former President Nixon led a conspiracy to break into the Democratic Party offices at Watergate and subsequently aided in the coverup. President Carl Albert, who as Speaker of the House helped push the congressional investigation, welcomed the decision by the court. He stated that no man is above the law and all men are responsible for his actions. President Albert noted with the trial done he hopes the nation can finally heal and move on to a brighter future and a more transparent government. Many Americans, even supporters of the former President, agree with this sentiment about responsibility."
 Agnew.1.d:0 "President Spiro Agnew has announced the appointment of George Romney as Vice President of the United States. Romney was once a strong candidate for President and seen as a Nixon political rival though he did join his first administration. As governor, Romney was able to garner support in blue collar Michigan and his appeal to working families is seen by many in the Republican Party as an asset for the next presidential election. Vice President Romney also was quite adept at working across the aisles with Democrats which President Spiro also sees as a major asset as he tries to implement policy in Congress. Although not the choice of more conservative Republicans, many across the country have expressed satisfaction with the new Vice President."
 Agnew.2.d:0 "In a nationally televised address to the nation, newly inaugurated President Spiro Agnew announced he was pardoning former President Richard Nixon. President Agnew stated the United States needed to move on and heal from the recent controversies and the only way it will end is through the presidential pardon. Former President Nixon resigned over the Watergate Scandal and the recent release of compromising White House recordings. The decision to pardon President Nixon has not been well received. Opponents accuse Agnew of colluding with Nixon to elevate himself to President while others suggest Nixon should have faced the consequences for his actions. Political observers note the reputation of President Agnew will be hurt due to his close relationship with Nixon. However, supporters of the President insist his decision was not the result of a political deal but the morally correct thing to do and he will take the political backlash in order to heal the nation."
 Amnesty.1.d:0 "The United States announced a program to offer amnesty to those who avoided being drafted by the armed forces. During times of recent conflict, a number of Americans chose to flee the United States or go into hiding to avoid their required military service. Many who avoided the draft or deserted claimed to do so out of a moral conviction or a belief that they could not support military actions. The new program will give those who avoided the draft amnesty if they request it from the government. This policy is seen as a compromise. While draft dodgers will not be directly punished, by requesting the amnesty they are still admitting guilt. The new policy is no doubt a compromise, but the government believes it is essential to resolving the issue of draft dodgers and bring these men back to their families."
 ERA.5.d:0 "\nAlthough originally proposed in the late 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has finally been ratified in the Constitution of the United States of America. The ERA ends any and all legal distinctions between men and women, especially in terms of divorce, property, and employment. Supporters of the bill now argue American women will finally enjoy all the legal rights of men and no longer be second class citizens. However, a number of middle-class women have opposed the ERA as eroding traditional gender roles, threatening the rights of mothers in divorce cases, and opening the door to women being conscripted for military service. They have called the ERA a travesty and are campaigning for states to oppose ratifying the amendment in their legislatures. Regardless of this opposition, the ERA was successfully passed, and large crowds of supporters are said to be jubilantly welcoming the news across the country."
 USA_Marijuana.1.d:0 "The United States has officially approved the decriminalization of marijuana. The drug has long been associated with counterculture and was a target of intense police crackdowns. However, many began arguing such a focus was detracting from the investigation of more serious crimes or the targeting of more harmful drugs in the United States. This was bolstered by recent articles suggesting the impact of marijuana was not much different than tobacco smoking or alcohol use. In addition, many states argued the potential profit to be made from taxes on marijuana may bring huge windfalls of cash to the government. These arguments all worked to sway the government to decriminalize the drug, however, there are opponents who argue this decision will end up hurting the American people as supporters for decriminalization downplayed the negative consequences legalization will cause."
 Clark_Amendment.1.d:0 "The violence in Angola has seen multiple foreign players involving themselves by supporting the different factions all fighting for control. The United States has also been aiding anti-communist groups on the ground with military aid. However, recent reports and exposes regarding incidents of human rights abuses and mass killings against civilians has spurred Congress to act. Senator Dick Clark has passed an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act called the Clark Amendment which forbade the United States to offer aid to private Angolan groups involved in military operations. The Clark Amendment has infuriated anti-communist advocates who believe support for these groups is a vital American interest. However, many Americans also support the act and believe the United States should not help perpetuate the continued violence in Angola."
 ELS_COUP.1.d:0 "The El Salvador government had proved largely ineffective in dealing with economic inequality and the rising influence of the extreme left. This resulted in a coalition between moderate military officers and civilians who launched a coup to overthrow the government and put a civil-military junta, known as Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG), to power. The junta enjoyed the support of the United States who fear a communist takeover. The junta has initiated a policy of moderate reforms to appease the population and brutal repression against what it identifies as the communist left. However, the increasing violence and the rise of government-supported death squads has greatly weakened the reform program and resistance, especially in the countryside is increasing."
 ELS_COUP.2.d:0 "The escalation of violence in El Salvador took a darker turn as news emerged that armed gunmen assassinated beloved Archbishop Oscar Romero as he was finishing a sermon. No group has claimed responsibility, but the brazen assassination of an outspoken human rights activists, clergyman, and champion for the poor, has shocked and angered many in the country. Many are pointing the finger at either the ruling Revolutionary Government Junta or a death squad associated with it. It is believed Romero was killed for his support of human right and recent calls for Salvadorian troops to disobey orders that violate human rights. The government has denied responsibility and say it is a tragic consequence of the escalating violence on both sides and no one can be blamed. The Catholic Church is said to be demanding a full, international investigation into the killing."
 Ford.10.d:0 "Members of the prestigious annual Host Breakfast invited President Ford to address the gathering after the Democratic California Governor refused to commit for the event. Eyeing the potential of galvanizing supporters in the state in preparation of the upcoming Presidential election, President Ford arrived to address the event. Former Manson Family member Lynette Fromme also arrived at the event armed with a pistol. Fromme had recently read of how pollution was threatening to destroy the environment, specifically the California redwood trees. The follower of the infamous serial killer decided that she would kill the President and show the establishment the seriousness of the environmental cause. After the event, President Ford began walking through a park to the California State House to meet leading California political leaders. As he approached, Fromme got to within a few feet of President Ford. She lifted the pistol and aimed it at the President..."
 Ford.11.d:0 "When Fromme pulled the trigger, a click was heard as it turned out the assassin had failed to chamber a round into the gun. Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf wrestled Fromme to the ground as she was noted as laughing at the luck of her not being able to complete her task. President Ford appeared unperturbed by the event and continued his program for the day. Many Americans applauded the President for his bravery in the face of death. The President himself stated he saw her raise the weapon but did not see the threat as serious, especially after Fromme was detained. Upon returning to the White House, Ford was greeted by his jubilant family and is said to be taking some time off. Fromme is expected to face trial for her attempted assassination. The FBI is investigating whether the infamous serial killer Charlie Manson played any role in the actions of his former disciple."
 Ford.12.d:0 "When Fromme pulled the trigger, a bullet hit President Gerald Ford in the chest. The President was rushed to the local hospital as the Secret Service took Fromme into custody. Fromme was heard shouting about how those who kill mother earth will suffer the consequences. Within hours, the President was pronounced dead. News of the assassination has sent shockwaves across the country and the world. President Ford long enjoyed a reputation of integrity and honesty and statements of condolences have already begun flooding in. Crowds of mourners are said to be waiting outside the White House. Internationally, many nations are also said to be shocked and uncertain with what the future holds for the United States. Vice President Rockefeller was privately sworn in as the new President and the nation awaits its new future."
 
 Allende.1.d:0 "When President Salvador Allende took power in Chile, his regime announced the beginning of a new socialist experiment for South America. Since taking power he has faced Supreme Court criticism and a Congress resolution calling on the military to act. President Allende pointed out these efforts were undemocratic attempts to remove the democratic choice of the people. Many in the country suspect these efforts are being influenced by the CIA who are desperate to see socialism fail in Chile. Early this morning however, a more serious crisis has emerged as news reached the capital that the navy had seized control of Valparaiso. President Allende now has news that armed troops are seizing locations across the capital and that radio stations have been bombed by the Air Force. A full-blown coup appears to be underway and President Allende must act fast. The next few hours will determine the future of Chile."
 Allende.2.d:0 "When news first reached President Allende that the navy had seized Valparaiso, he sought to contact his senior military officers. He could not reach them and feared the coup leaders had detained the senior officers. However, it turned out the senior officers, except the Navy Chief who was detained, were leading the coup attempt and by the time President Allende realized this it was too late. The coup leaders demanded a resignation, but President Allende refused as he was the elected President of Chile. Instead, armed troops attempted to seize the Presidential Palace but faced resistance from loyal socialist militia fighters. As military forces closed in, Allende addressed the nation, stating he would not legitimize the coup or be a tool for the new regime. Shortly after the new military government announced President Allende had committed suicide. After a brief struggle, Chile is now under the control of the military."
 Allende.3.d:0 "When news first reached President Allende of the coup he feared the coup leaders had detained his senior military officers as he could not contact them. However, it turned out the senior officers, except Admiral Montero, were leading the coup attempt. But the coup plotters failed to detain Admiral Montero who managed to restore his control over the navy. As soldiers began occupying key sites across the capital, news reached that the navy in Vaparaiso returned the city to government authority. The ensuing confusion slowed the military and some regional commanders backed out of the plot. An attempt hours later to seize the Presidential Palace ended in failure as a large number of pro-Allende militia were able to reinforce the Palace from attack. Shortly thereafter the coup leaders surrendered and ordered their forces to stand down. President Allende addressed the nation, announcing democratic rule has triumphed over tyranny and conspiracy."
 War_Powers.1.d:0 "The United States Congress has overridden the presidential veto and have passed a War Powers Resolution or War Powers Act. The new law intends to check executive power by requiring the President to acquire congressional approval for any military action. Many in Congress hail the act as a victory for democracy and a way to ensure no President may use military force for their own agenda or interests. In general, the bill has widespread public support, but the White House noted in such a fast-paced world of changing circumstances, the new law will hinder the ability of the United States to act effectively. Observers of the bill note the law has potential loopholes and time will tell whether the President can truly be challenged in times of crisis."

 NIC_USA.1.d:0 "The Sandinista National Liberation Front emerged from the merging of several youth and student groups at university campuses. The party increasingly espouses a socialist ideology in opposition to the ruling Somoza family. For many Nicaraguans, the Somoza regime has led to economic hardship, political repression, and a policy of capitulating to demands from the United States. The Sandinistas have grown in popularity in recent years due to blatant corruption and the failure of the government to deal with a recent earthquake disaster. The group has campaigned for higher wages and has launched several raids against the Somoza family and their supporters. The United States views the rise of this leftist organization with increasing suspicion and is backing the Nicaraguan government in its efforts to deal with the threat."
 NIC_USA.2.d:0 "The rise of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front and their campaign of kidnapping and fomenting unrest had enraged the Nicaraguan government led by long-term ruler Anastasio Somoza. The Somoza family itself had been ruling the country since the last American military intervention and have enjoyed decades of aid from the United States. The Nicaraguan government has unleashed a brutal campaign of killings and suppression to quell the unrest called the Siege Policy, but this has not ended the unrest. In fact, the scale of the violence has shocked the United States and although they oppose the Sandinistas as an alternative regime, it has been decided to suspend American aid to the Nicaraguan government and Somoza. The Somoza regime was quick to call the move a betrayal of an anti-communist ally, but the United States insists it cannot support the gross human rights violations occurring in Nicaragua."
 NIC_USA.3.d:0 "Following the kidnapping campaign of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front against the Nicaraguan government, its ruler decided to launch a Siege Policy. The long-term Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza has unleased his American trained National Guard to lead a campaign of extra judicial killings, violence, press censorship, and intimidation to target leftists across the country and prevent news from leaking abroad. Although many nations have already condemned this policy as perpetuating human rights abuses, the United States government has decided to endorse the Siege Policy. The American government cannot risk the socialist Sandinistas from coming to power and removing a key American ally. Indeed, an American official told media that the Nicaraguan government was defending itself and the people from communist terror, indicating its support for the Somoza regime."
 NIC_USA.4.d:0 "Pedro Chamorro was editor for the popular newspaper La Prensa, founder of a pro-democracy party, and the relative of two former Nicaraguan presidents. A group of gunmen pulled up to Chamorro in a car and opened fire, killing Chamorro. His death has sparked outrage across the country as the opposition blames the government of dictator Anastasio Somoza responsible for the killing. At his funeral, tens of thousands took to the street, leading to violence and riots targeting the Somoza regime. A general strike also shutdown most businesses for several days. The Somoza regime has blamed a local businessman upset at criticism from La Prensa but most people hold the government responsible."
 NIC_USA.5.d:0 "President Anastasio Somoza has officially resigned as President of Nicaragua. He and his family are said to have already fled, with many suspecting they are fleeing with millions in state assets. The fall of the Somoza regime has seen forces for the Sandinista National Liberation Front enter the capital. A new socialist regime under the Sandinistas is expected to take power as their forces currently control almost the entire country. The failure of Somoza to compromise on demands for reforms, address the decades long economic inequalities, and its use of repression facilitated their downfall. Many in Nicaragua are not mourning the fall of the Somoza family but there is uncertainty regarding what the future of Nicaragua holds."
 USA_NIC_WAR.1.d:0 "The United States military has invaded Nicaragua. This is the first direct military action in Nicaragua since the United States withdrew from the country in 1933. The rise of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front has threatened to turn Nicaragua into a socialist state. For the United States, having a socialist government so close to the continental United States and in a position to spread socialist unrest across is neighbors is seen as unacceptable. The American military stated its objective was to save the people of Nicaragua from an oppressive regime. It added it expected to be well-received by the people and did not anticipate heavy resistance. In neighboring states across the region, many have taken to the street to protest American military action. There are fears that the American intervention is a return to the American gunboat diplomacy of the early twentieth century."
 contra.1.d:0 "The new Sandinista government has started a program of socialist reform for the betterment of Nicaraguan society. However, there are those from the old regime who resist change. For decades these people profited from corruption and exploitation. On top of that, the United States is openly organizing these factions into armed militants in order to destroy the will of Nicaraguans. These militants are calling themselves Contras and are conducting operations against our Sandinista government. Our own sources tell us the Contras are being unified by foreign intelligence agencies and their goal is to destroy socialism in Nicaragua. As the Contras conduct more operations, they are gaining more support from sympathizers and are increasingly instilling fear in the hearts of many Nicaraguans."
 contra.2.d:0 "The collapse of the Somoza regime and the rise of the socialist Sandinistas marked a radical transformation of governance in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas initially promised to respect democracy and end the economic disparity across society. However, several factions of Nicaraguans have grown suspicious of the Sandinistas and believe they are instead building a communist society. These factions have organized into militant groups called Contras that are launching attacks against the Sandinistas. The Contras consist of three main groups, former Somoza regime supporters, anti-communists, and anti-Somozan fighters who feel they were lied to by the Sandinistas after they took power. The CIA is said to be unifying these Contra groups and supporting anti-Sandinista factions in Nicaragua. Many fear the rise of the Contras may lead to civil war and violence."
 USA_NIC.50.d:0 "For the first time since the early 1930s, United States marines have landed in force in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua. The American government had stated the marines would be focused on protecting the embassy and airport but reports from Managua indicate they are being deployed at key military checkpoints. This deployment greatly shores up Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza as he struggles to maintain power against socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front rebels. The Sandinista fighters had been making gains but with the American deployment many expect the tide may turn. President Somoza has been waging a brutal campaign against the Sandinistas, facing widespread international condemnation for human rights violations but the United States continues to consistently stand with him as an essential anti-communist bulwark."
 AST_CIA.1.d:0 "The current Australian Labor Party government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam has raised alarm bells with our government. Prime Minister Whitlam has suggested he would consider the possibility of shutting down American military bases in Australia. Such a scenario would be devastating to our interests in the South Pacific. The CIA however has a potential solution. They believe the current Australian Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, is sympathetic and understanding to the importance of an American military presence. One of our agents will approach the Governor-General and request he use his constitutional power to dismiss the weak Whitlam government and not only end the political deadlock in Australia but help in the global defense against communist influence."
 AST_CIA.2.d:0 "The current Australian Labor Party government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam has raised alarm bells with our government. Prime Minister Whitlam has suggested he would consider the possibility of shutting down American military bases in Australia. Such a scenario would be devastating to our interests in the South Pacific. We recently dispatched an agent to ask the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, to use his constitutional power to dismiss the government. Doing so would aid the current political issues plaguing Australia and protect our bases. However, this attempt to get the support of the Governor-General failed as he has decided against dismissing the government."
 AST_CIA.3.d:0 "In a shocking development, the political crisis in Australia boiled into the dramatic dismissal of the ruling Labor Party of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Although Whitman and the opposition appeared to be close to achieving a compromise, the Governor-General instead decided to take the drastic action of dismissing the government. The decision of the Governor-General certainly suits the interests of the United States and its fears that Whitman intended to remove American military bases from the country. The CIA privately is taking credit for convincing the Governor-General to act. Australians are said to be stunned by these actions and fear for the democratic future of the country. However, the new government insists it will hold elections soon and end the recent political turmoil."
