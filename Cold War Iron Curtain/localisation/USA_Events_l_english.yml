 CIA_60s.2.d:0 "With the continuation of our non-interventionist agenda towards the left dictating our Foreign Policy, the CIA has deemed it necessary to remove the President of Ecuador, Jose Velasco. The CIA had only come to this conclusion after Velasco's stubborn resistance and opposition to the USA's policy of breaking ties with Communist Cuba and suppression of Leftist and Communist activities at home. The CIA has infiltrated the structure of Political Organizations within Ecuador ranging across the political scale, directing all citizens away from support of Communists in Cuba and Anti-American views. It has also began electronic monitoring of Sensitive Frequencies in Ecuador. With all essential information required, acquired, the CIA moved forward with the removal of Velasco from the Office of Ecuadorian President. With the force of the Ecuadorian Military on the CIA's side Velasco had no choice but to surrender power. Velasco has been replaced with his Vice President, Carlos Arosemena, a figure more lenient to American Policies."

After the KKK set up in a sympathetic farmer's field the Lumbee men encircled the KKK and proceeded to yell and attack the KKK while shooting at the Klansmen, the Klansmen attempted to return fire but failed and ended up in 4 Klansmen being wounded and the rest fleeing leaving their family, their public address system, and an unlit cross. With Roberson County deputies deputies and sheriffs breaking up the celebration by the Lumbee with tear gas grenades."
 book_releases.1.d:0 "On June 8th, 1949, George Orwell published the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Set in the distant year of 1984, it focuses on three megalithic states and their constant, shifting war on each other and on their own people. During the early 1950s, the United Kingdom becomes involved in a third World War, this time involving nuclear weapons like used over Japan in 1945. Britain falls to civil war, with the authoritarian English Socialist Party, or Ingsoc, emerging victorious. In the authoritarian state, thoughts are policed, history is revised, and a cult of personality to the mustachioed Big Brother reigns supreme."
 kef.2.d:0 "The Golden Age of Comic Books in the USA lasted from 1938 to 1945 and its end saw the sharp decline of superhero comics. New genres, such as crime and horror comics, have sparked outrage with allegations that these comics inspire illegal behaviour among minors, known as Juvenile Delinquency. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency was tasked by the Senate to investigate these allegations. The infamous Comic Book Hearings took place on April 21st, 22nd and June 4th 1954, and had a profound effect on the future of comic books, with the taste of graphic images in the comics being brought into question. The publishing of the book ‘Seduction of the Innocent' has galvanised public opinion against comic books and given the industry unfavourable press coverage, effectively forcing them to adopt the Comics Code Authority, enforcing self-censorship upon themselves and resulting in the harsh censorship or even cancellation of many long-standing comic series. The ramifications of this are yet to be fully felt, but it's already clear that this is a devastating blow for the already struggling American comic book industry."
 little_rock.1.d:0 "In a historic series of events, nine African-American students have been admitted to Little Rock Central High school under protection of the 101st Airborne Division. After the Brown vs Board case, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People registered nine students for attendance at the Little Rock Central High school: Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls, who soon became known as the Little Rock Nine. Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas called in the National Guard to prevent them from attending and images of their plight were spread across world media, bringing in major international attention. After the Guard was removed following legal action and the police took over, mass rioting and protests forced them to remove the students. Following this, President Eisenhower made the Momentous decision to deploy 1,200 men of the 101st Airborne Division to ensure the students attended safely. Despite suffering constant harassment throughout the year, this turn of events represents a significant stride in desegregation efforts across the US and, occuring only a year after the Bus Boycott in Alabama, could help lead to greater rights for African-Americans in the southern states."
 kef.10.d:0 "Massive amounts of arrests and investigations were done today, as the federal government declared a national crackdown on juvenile delinquents, citing the rapid increase of youth related crimes over the past decade. According to the Department of Justice, the amount of youth related crimes has exacerbated over the years. As such, law and order cannot be maintained, and juvenile delinquents have been given lax treatment by the judicial system. Civil rights organizations condemn this act, for it preys on the rights of the youth, and is very prone to abuse."
 kef.7.d:0 "The American Medical Association has come under fire today, as recent reports circulate that its donors, mostly big pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, have influenced its policies and lobbying agendas, making them complicit in corruption and conflicts of interest scandal. The scandal, involving the highest echelons of the organization, were recently given vast sums of donations, half of it goes to themselves and half goes to the organization, in return for favors and influence in the organization's policy. The American Medical Association has yet to respond, but observers state that it would far reaching consequences in the future."
 kef.3.d:0 "President of the United States Estes Kefauver has recently been praised by various civil rights organizations, as the President is embarking on a massive civil rights campaign, calling for the empowerment of minorities and their integration to American society. In a privileged speech, Kefauver said that it is the obligation of the American people to treat everyone equally, regardless of race, religion, sexuality, and other aspects, and judge people solely on a person's character rather than skin color. This however has seen backlash by various white supremacist groups throughout the country, condemning his actions and demand an immediate retraction."
 sab_army_mc.1.d:0 "The McCarthy Hearings have been suspended until further notice today, as recent evidence showing the incompetence of various military officials in said hearings, virtually giving them no right to judge Joseph McCarthy, one of Washington's most prominent senators who has come under controversy for releasing documents pertaining to alleged communist officials in the US Government. This development is a major victory for the Senator, as he can finally continue his so-called 'crusade against communism', a phrase coined by his various supporters. Observers say that should McCarthy continue such crusade, we will be looking at not only a more anti-communist America, but a more undemocratic America."
 cultural_events.9.d:0 "The world community saw the passing of one of it's great, unsung protectors today as English cryptographer Alan Turing was found dead in what appears to be an act of suicide; Doctor Turing, 41, is considered to be the forefather of modern computer science and played no small role in the cracking of "Enigma" the Nazi German navel codes, a key role that aided the allied war effort in the Battle of the Atlantic among others; he is believed to be potentially responsible for saving upwards of 14 million lives and even shortening the length of the second world war by as long two years, The British government has been quick to distance themselves from the death of Turing, however, homosexual laws in the British Isles being what they are, Turing had been forced to stand trial for the crime of being a homosexual and the cryptographer was sentenced to chemical castration not ten years before his untimely passing.\nWhatever controversy that haunted Turing in life, in death, he shall be remembered as the spearhead into the heart of the Axis war machine and a pivotal figure in saving Britain, Europe, and, indeed, the world from fascism and tyranny."
 kef.8.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American president Estes Kefauver has publicly denounced the Southern Manifesto. Signed in March 1956 in response to Brown vs Board, it is the main base of Southern opposition to increasingly persistent federal efforts at desegregation. His speech was met with reactions varying from praise to accusations of treason, even by members of his own Democratic party. With the president committing himself to the cause of desegregation, tensions with the those who advocate for maintaining the status quo have increased considerably. Kefauver himself now faces widespread opposition from Dixiecrat influences in his party, although this is partially offset by increasing support from those sympathetic to the civil rights movement. One thing that is certain, however, is that the process of desegregating American society has been greatly sped up by these developments - and the south may have to embrace the winds of change blowing their way."
 phi_events.2.d:0 "Violence and civil unrest run rampant throughout Manila and the entirety of the Philippine archipelago, as various student activists, civic groups, and opposition factions, most of which have direct links to the Communist Party of the Philippines, have been organizing demonstrations and protests condemning the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and his supposed American masters. Reports have circulated that these demonstrations have rapidly escalated to large scale violence, as these demonstrators have already attacked various government districts, such as Mendiola, which is near proximity to Malacanang Palace, the official residence of the President, and the American embassy, which according to the militants is the de facto seat of power in the Philippines. In response to such acts of violence, President Ferdinand Marcos mobilized the Philippine Constabulary and broke up the demonstrations violently, if necessary. With the rapid increase in civil unrest, along with the Communist threat reaching the academia, observers predict that the Marcos government will institute radical measures to quell rebellion and the Communist threat."
 phi_events.3.d:0 "On September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos has just signed Proclamation No. 1081, a presidential proclamation declaring Martial Law throughout the entire Philippine archipelago. According to President Marcos, Martial Law was declared due to the decay of law and order, along with the ever growing threat of Communism which has gained rapid momentum, claiming that they are in the final works of a revolutionary uprising against his government. Opposition groups claim however that the vast majority of terrorist attacks experienced by the Philippines were orchestrated by the President's inner circle of military generals to promote fear and terror amongst the populace, thereby giving legitimacy to his declaration. Nevertheless, the implementation of Martial Law was swift, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP, able to secure strategic areas detrimental to the Marcos regime, and the implementation of the 'General Orders' placed on the proclamation. Observers are mixed with their response to this declaration, as some sympathize with the government, while others criticize it, believing in the story of the opposition."
 kef.9.d:0 "In a decisive move by President Kefauver of the United States, the process for nominating Democratic candidates has been radically altered to increase the effectiveness of the manner in which Democratic presidential candidates are selected. Traditionally, candidates were selected primarily in secret by party leaders, sometimes resulting in the selection of candidates who had never run as a delegate in a primary election. The President has put forward guidelines on how candidates should be selected, swiftly modernising the nomination process to take into account the will of the people and effectively forcing states to select their delegates via Presidential Primaries. The result of this reform is that the Democratic voters have a much larger role in the outcome than they had previously, and the move has taken a significant amount of power out of the hands of powerful politicians and into the hands of the people. It's now clear that the future Democratic candidates will represent the people more than they did in previous elections. Whether this will have an effect on future elections remains to be seen."

 adlai_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. In a shocking move by President Adlai Stevenson, he has refused to enforce the act and stated that he intends to allow any schools that wish to retain educational segregation to do so. This decision has prompted great outrage from Liberal elements within the Democratic Party and there are scattered calls for the impeachment of the President. However, it seems unlikely any of these calls will come to fruition, and the South's position as well as that of the segregationist movement has been greatly strengthened."
 truman_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the southern states, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Truman has always been known as being in favour of civil rights, passing the very first legislation desegregating the military in 1948. To no surprise, Truman has announced before congress his intentions to immediately enforce the ruling throughout the country. While causing considerable unrest in the south, actual resistance has been limited. Despite scattered calls for his impeachment by Dixiecrats within the Democratic Party, no solid base of opposition has formed, and it appears that the President will face no considerable political threats in the near future. How the southern states will handle these rapid changes and adapt to the new political climate remains a matter of contention."
 kef.6.d:0 "In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration was founded in 1906 to promote public health through the regulation of food safety and various medical instruments. With laws relating to public health constantly being updated, calls to empower the FDA have intensified since the end of World War 2, and following Kefauver's election to the presidency he has appeared somewhat willing to implement reforms to further expand the FDA's power. Recently, the President has proposed legislation to radically expand the FDA's authority in public health affairs, and today the changes have been officially ratified by Congress. With the bill coming into effect in the following days, the changes will likely be a major factor in the ongoing fight for the improvement of public health, although the changes have drawn criticism from those arguing against what they perceive as too much government intervention in the lives of American citizens."

Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Kefauver has always been known as a crusader for civil rights and, only a day after the ruling was handed down, has announced before congress his intentions to ‘uphold the ruling wherever possible'. While only a short speech, this represents a major stride for the civil rights movement in the United States and appears to be a decisive turning point for segregation in America."
 kef.1.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American President Estes Kefauver has officially declared war on the Italian-American mafia, vowing to root them out and ‘restore order' to American cities. Originating mainly from descendants of Italian immigrants, the mafia rose to prominence during the prohibition era and remain active in many industrial American cities, such as Chicago, operating a vast and well-organised criminal network. Before his rise to the presidency, Kefauver presided over hearings in 1950 that brought nationwide attention to the growing issue of organised crime, and following his election to the presidency many have expected him to take legal action regarding the issue. Until now, the mafia have faced relatively little opposition from law enforcement in building their criminal empire, but it now appears that this will soon change. Reactions to the President's speech have been varied, however there seems to be a distinct contrast between those strongly in favour of clamping down on organised crime and those who predict the drastic consequences a conflict with the mafia may have on the societies of areas in the direct vicinity of the inevitable conflict. Several congressmen have even suggested that it may be too hard to completely root out the well-established mafia and would only lead to further conflict, anger and damage within urban communities. Regardless of the consequences, this ambitious move will have significant long-term consequences to the lives of many, but whether the attempts will bear fruit remains unforeseeable."
 adlai_civil.2.d:0 "Many conservative southern voters split from the Democrat Party in 1948 to form the Dixiecrat Party, however they performed poorly in the 1948 elections and many returned to the Democrats, causing the end of the Dixiecrats. Following the election of President Adlai Stevenson, many former Dixiecrats have been emboldened by the president's pro-segregationist policies and their influence within the party has grown rapidly. Throughout his term, more vocal Dixiecrats have openly advocated for the president to take further steps to protect southern traditions, and make sure Jim Crow laws are upheld in the south. Recently, pressure on the President from Dixiecrats within the party have intensified, causing many internal issues for the President and pressuring him into action. In response to this pressure, President Adlai has announced before congress his intention to uphold Jim Crow laws in the southern states. This move immediately prompted protests amongst civil rights supporters and many have voiced concerns over the implications of this on the treatment of African-Americans in the south. With the president bowing to Dixiecrat interests, it seems the desegregation movement has suffered a major setback."
