 LUX_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "FN-49"
 LUX_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "With design stretching back to early 1930s, the FN-49 is available as both a semi-automatic rifle and as a selective fire automatic rifle with 10-round magazines.\nWhile well regarded for its high build quality and reliability in comparison to the rifles of the time, its marketability was limited, as it was not developed in time for use in World War II but later, as many militaries had already begun the switch to selective fire battle rifles. An unknown number of FN-49s were produced as selective fire automatic rifles, but the small 10 round box magazine limited the usefulness of the fully automatic feature."
