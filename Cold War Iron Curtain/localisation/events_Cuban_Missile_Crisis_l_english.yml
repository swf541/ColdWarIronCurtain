 cubamc.1.d:0 "The White House directed the Pentagon to begin deploying squadrons of nuclear armed Jupiter missiles to Italy and Turkey. The deployment in Italy will guard against communist aggression from the Soviet bloc. The missiles in Turkey will defend the southern flank of NATO from overwhelming Soviet aggression. The Italians and Turkish governments agreed to the deployment following one on one meetings with American officials. The Jupiter missiles are Medium Range Ballistic Missiles and their deployment is being met with great concern from the Soviet Union. Moscow believes the missiles are a first strike weapon that are being positioned so close to Soviet territory in order to reduce their potential response time in the event of war. For the American government the deployment is meant to shore up its NATO allies who live under constant fear of potential Soviet aggression."
 cubamc.2.d:0 "The deployment of American Jupiter nuclear missiles to Turkey and Italy is a direct threat to the stability and defense of the Soviet people. Senior military leaders and Premier Nikita Khrushchev have developed the outlines of a plan to secretly deploy Soviet missiles in Cuba called Operation Anadyr. This would restore strategic balance and make the Americans think twice about surrounding our nation with such weapons in the future. To lay the groundwork for this we must secure the cooperation of Cuba and its leader President Fidel Castro. The head of our Strategic Missile Force, Marshal Sergey Biryuzov is being dispatched to Havana and ask for Cuban support."
 cubamc.3.d:0 "Marshal Sergey Biryuzov held initial talks with the Cuban leader President Fidel Castro. He outlined the planned secret deployment of our forces on the island and urged his cooperation. Castro appeared at times enthusiastic over the proposal, saying this would punish the Americans for their aggression towards the Cuban people. However, he expressed worry that accepting the deployment of such weapons would make him appear as a Soviet client and hurt the cause of revolution in the Americas. Instead of a missile deployment, Castro offered a counteroffer where the Soviets sign a Defense Alliance with Cuba. This would guarantee Cuban independence from further American aggression and humiliate them for their failure to suppress the Cuban Revolution. We must direct Biryuzov to insist on a missile deployment, or we can accept the counteroffer."
 cubamc.4.d:0 "Our representatives politely declined the Cuban counteroffer, we explained the United States is already aware of the close relationship between our nations. We then reiterated our desire for the deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. Such a result would not just humiliate the Americans but also firmly put them in the position they have put the Cuban people in with their constant threats of invasion. After some consideration, we are pleased to report President Fidel Castro accepted and announced Cuba would warmly welcome the Soviet deployment. With approval received, plans are already being made to load freighters with building equipment, weapons, and personnel so that we can quickly bring the missiles into operation. Our first deployment will likely take a month."
 cubamc.5.d:0 "Our representatives politely declined the Cuban counteroffer, we explained the United States is already aware of the close relationship between our nations. We then reiterated our desire for the deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. Such a result would not just humiliate the Americans but also firmly put them in the position they have put the Cuban people in with their constant threats of invasion. Unfortunately, President Fidel Castro declined again. He insisted the best way forward would be the signing of a Defensive Alliance. He stated his worry that if the secret deployment of sophisticated Soviet weaponry were discovered, the Americans will portray him as a Soviet client. This would be catastrophic for the cause of revolution in the Americas. It is clear the Cubans will not help us in Operation Anadyr. We must decide whether we sign the alliance, which would hurt the standing of the United States in the region, or just tell the Cubans we will think it over and end the talks."
 cubamc.6.d:0 "In Havana today, senior representatives of the Soviet Union signed a Defensive Alliance with the Cuban government led by President Fidel Castro. The treaty guarantees both nations will come to the others defense in case of aggression. The agreement is being portrayed and seen as a direct response to the United States. President Castro in his remarks noted the treaty shows how deeply the Soviet people care for the oppressed peoples of the world as they agreed with full knowledge of the hostile intentions of the Americans. The Soviet government released its own statement saying it will never abandon the people of Cuba and will continue to aid their revolutionary path. In the United States newspapers criticized the White House for losing Cuba to the communist bloc and raised fears that the Cubans may expand its destabilizing efforts across the region. Analysts also claim the treaty directly challenges the cherished Monroe Doctrine which declares the Western Hemisphere as part of the American sphere ofi influence."
 cubamc.7.d:0 "Freighters from the Soviet Union, carrying troops, engineers, leaders, and heavy moving equipment recently landed in Cuba. Moving secretly, they have already begun upgrading Cuban airfields and preparing launch sites for the nuclear missiles to be loaded on to. The personnel chosen for this assignment are among the best and most loyal in the whole Soviet Union. We do not expect the Americans to discover our activities from intelligence sources on the island. The base and missile crews are being guarded by a large Soviet force and the Air Force will also deploy fighter jets to shore up the air defense of the sites."
 cubamc.8.d:0 "The CIA was conducting regular aerial reconnaissance flights over Cuba to determine their intentions and find evidence of Soviet deployments. However, recently these flights were stopped due to the risk of international incidents and the arrival of sophisticated Soviet anti-air weaponry for the Cuban military. A Navy recon flight recently noticed a Soviet freighter that appeared to be carrying crates of Soviet aircraft parts to Cuba. In addition, intelligence reports indicated the deployment of SAM sites in Cuba along the pattern of those setup to defend Soviet nuclear missile sites. With this information, spy plane flights were resumed, under Air Force control. The subsequent photographs were analyzed, and Soviet nuclear missile launch sites were identified. The President was soon informed, and he immediately called a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council to formulate a response. For many in the government, Soviet nuclear deployments in Cuba was akin to placing nuclear weapons on American soil."
 cubamc.9.d:0 "President Kennedy convened the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOM) to go over the photographs of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba and decide on a response. All the members agreed a decision must be made as soon as possible. In the end, President Kennedy had three options. His first, presented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff called for hundreds of targets to be struck in airstrikes immediately, followed by an invasion of Cuba. The President noted such an option would likely see Berlin fall to the Soviets and weaken NATO. The second option, endorsed by most of the members, would be to establish a blockade to prevent the arrival of more offensive weapons to the island. Finally, there was the option to not respond. Some committee members believed the Soviet deployment was too small to upset the balance of power and making it into an issue could cause unnecessary panic embolden the Soviets."

 cubamc.10.d:0 "News from Havana says American planes have bombed sites and infrastructure across the island. They are apparently targeting our construction sites and Cuban defense infrastructure. The American navy is being mobilized and the Cubans expect a land invasion soon. There are already rumors of American paratroopers or special forces already operating on the island. The Cuban President, Fidel Castro urgently requested our help. We must decide on an adequate response. One option is to back Cuba completely and launch a full nuclear retaliation against the United States, which would devastate both our nations. The second option could be to authorize our forces already on Cuba to engage invading forces, this would be a more limited response, but reduces the risk of a nuclear exchange. Our forces combined with the Cubans may turn the tide of battle. Finally, we can cut our losses and inform President Castro he is on his own."
 cubamc.11.d:0 "Forces from the United States and its allies in West Berlin surrendered to the Soviet military. The American commander made the decision in order to prevent the loss of civilian lives and with a recognition that any armed resistance would lead to the annihilation of his own forces for no gain. The Soviet seizing of Berlin is retaliation to the United States invasion of Cuba. The Soviets claimed its actions were justified as they were securing their own sphere of influence as America claimed it was doing in Cuba. American allies in Europe are said to be fuming over the news with many blaming the reckless actions of the United States over Cuba for provoking this latest Soviet action. It is unknown how the United States will respond or when or if the Soviets plan on returning the surrendered forces. Many in Europe fear the situation is escalating into a new world war."
 cubamc.12.d:0 "The Navy informed the White House its blockade was active. To reduce an escalation in violence or provide an excuse for the Soviets to escalate, the State Department was able to get the blockade approved not as an act of war but as a defense measure to protect the Western Hemisphere. This was done by getting approval from the Organization of American States and pledging that the blockade is only meant to prevent the arrival of offensive weapons to the island as per the terms of the 1947 Rio Treaty. In addition, we provided an ultimatum to the Soviet government that our actions will not cease until all offensive Soviet missiles were removed from the island."
 
 cubamc.13.d:0 "\nThe American people were stunned this evening when President [USA.GetLeader] informed the nation of the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba. In his address [USA.GetLeader] noted that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any state in the Western Hemisphere would be seen as a direct attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. The President also informed his plan of setting up what he described as a quarantine of Cuba. He stated any ships found to carry offensive weapons will be turned back, but those that did not would be allowed entry. He added the United States Navy would implement this quarantine from international waters. He emphasized the quarantine was not going to halt the import of necessities of life or nonmilitary goods. American forces across the globe are also being mobilized."
 cubamc.14.d:0 "The Americans discovered the details of Operation Anadyr and know we intend to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba. Their recent declaration of a blockade and ultimatum to our government to withdraw the missiles show the operation is no longer a secret. We already have freighters bound for Cuba carrying weapons and the American blockade can easily be the first step in a major escalation in conflict. The leadership has decided to issue orders for our forces in Cuba to prepare for an invasion and our ambassador will inform President Castro that the Americans are aware we already have missiles on the island, and he must prepare his own forces."
 cubamc.15.d:0 "It is clear the American navy intends to board and inspect all our ships as they have already boarded and inspected a ship from Lebanon. The American navy is already moving its ships in the path of our approaching freighters. The captains of our ships are desperate for orders. We must decide whether we want to have the ships hold position and try to negotiate a deal with the Americans or if we should push forward, challenge the blockade. If we go with the second option, the freighters will be followed closely by our submarines in the area. The tension continues to mount as Soviet forces across the world are going on higher alert."
 cubamc.16.d:0 "After tense messages between Moscow and Washington, the White House received a firm offer from Premier [SOV.GetLeader]. The Soviet leader promised to withdraw all nuclear weapons from Cuba on the condition we withdraw our nuclear missiles from Turkey and promise not to invade Cuba. Upon hearing the offer, many in the administration immediately insisted we reject the proposal and demand an unconditional Soviet withdrawal. To them the Soviet offer shows weakness. However, the President and his close advisors appear inclined to accept the deal, a war in Cuba would be costly and the missiles in Turkey were largely obsolete. Essentially the United States would lose nothing and achieve its goals while the Soviets could save face internationally. However, not the President must decide which position he will take, the lives of millions are in the balance."
 cubamc.17.d:0 "News reached Premier Nikita Khrushchev and his top officials that the American government accepted his proposal to resolve the crisis in Cuba. Few in the room could hide their delight and relief that a solution had been reached. The Soviet military is already being directed to withdraw forces from Cuba and call back freighters headed for the island. The Americans agreeing to withdraw their missiles from Turkey is being hailed a strategic victory. More importantly, by achieving a guarantee from the Americans not to invade Cuba, we have secured the Cuban revolution. President Fidel Castro did express some disappointment over the result, but he will soon realize this was the best outcome."
 cubamc.18.d:0 "After a tense two weeks in which the world held its collective breath, the Cuban Missile Crisis came to an end. The United States and Soviet Union were able to secure in agreement that will see the Soviet Union dismantle and remove its nuclear forces from Cuba. In exchange the United States pledged it will respect the sovereignty and rights of Cuba. Many are viewing the agreement as a victory for the United States though there are rumors that the American government may have made other concessions regarding the deployment of its nuclear forces. Regardless, the American people are praising the President for his firm leadership during the crisis. Within the Soviet Union, their appears to be tension among the Politburo as many members felt the crisis should not have reached the stage of brinkmanship."
 cubamc.19.d:0 "We have received word that the American government has rejected our sensible proposals and are demanding the unconditional withdrawal of our nuclear weapons from Cuba. The senior military leadership says we now have only two choices. One is to admit the Cuba project has failed and begin the process of withdrawing our forces, thankfully this would not be a difficult process. However, this would be a devastating diplomatic setback for the state. The other option is to order our freighters to push on and try to get past the blockade. This may put the pressure back on the Americans and they will decide whether they want war or not. The decision is ours, the future of the global revolution is on the line."
 cubamc.20.d:0 "The world is breathing a lot easier now that news reached that the Soviet Union will begin dismantling and withdrawing all its nuclear forces from Cuba. The United States insists no agreement was made and the Soviets have decided to make the right decision. News of the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba are being met with praise from American allies while socialist states are reportedly very angry at the apparent Soviet capitulation to American demands. The Cuban government is said to be despondent over the Soviet withdrawal and Fidel Castro is furious that the Soviets have apparently abandoned the Cuban nation. Crowds emerged in cities across America to celebrate the strong leadership of the President throughout the crisis."
 cubamc.21.d:0 "The Pentagon informed the White House that Soviet freighters, likely carrying offensive weapons are attempting to cross the blockade. Our warships have issued stern warnings, but the vessels are ignoring them. We must make a critical decision, order our ships to open fire and neutralize the Soviet vessels or back off and let them pass. Some cabinet officials point out the Soviet presence and nuclear weapons will hardly have an impact on the strategic balance, and we should stand down rather than risk a cataclysmic exchange. Others, especially the military leaders call for our forces to implement the blockade and demonstrate the serious of our position by firing on the disobeying vessels. A monumental decision must be made."
 cubamc.22.d:0 "When Soviet vessels passed through the naval quarantine of the United States and arrived in Cuba amidst much fanfare, it quickly became apparent the American policy failed. The United States previously warned that any vessels violating their quarantine would risk forcible seizure or fire, but this did not happen. Already the naval forces enforcing the quarantine are returning back to their bases. In a national address, the American President stated he ordered the ships to stand down to preserve international peace and prevent the deaths of countless innocents. He accused the Soviets of playing with the fate of the world. The Soviets in contrast stated the United States had ended its illegal piracy and that the Soviet presence on Cuba was meant to defend the small island nation which had already faced American aggression. Internationally the Soviets are viewed as the victors in the Cuban Missile Crisis and are expected to expand its presence in the region, as the world returns from the brink."
 cubamc.23.d:0 "Reports form our freighters pushing towards Cuba is that American warships are firing on the vessels. The ships have virtually no armaments and the Americans appear to be firing to stop the vessels not destroy them in order to inspect their cargo. However, our submarines escorting the vessels are moving in to engage the American naval ships. The Americans have no regard for the safety of the world, or our men; and we have given the submarines orders to defend the freighters at all costs. Hopefully with the element of surprise our vessels will prevail."
 cubamc.24.d:0 "Reports from Havana indicate that nuclear detonations have occurred off the coast of Cuba. These came after news that warships from the United States Navy were engaged in active combat against Soviet naval vessels, including submarines. A representative at the Pentagon addressed the reports by stating Soviet submarines armed with nuclear torpedoes recklessly launched them at American ships implementing the quarantine as endorsed by the Organization of American States. He did not have information on casualties or losses for either side. In Moscow, the Soviets claimed American naval vessels launched an unprovoked attack on unarmed freighters forcing the Soviet submarines to respond in force. Mass chaos is descending in cities across the world as fears of a full-scale nuclear exchange rise."
 cubamc.25.d:0 "In a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior cabinet members, and top advisors, the President of the United States finds himself in a situation he desperately wished to avoid. The use of nuclear weapons by the Soviet navy against American naval ships cannot be left unanswered. There are some calls for an equivalent nuclear strike on a Soviet naval target, but the senior military leaders insist such an approach would only allow the Soviets more time and opportunity to hit American targets. The President agrees and has given orders for the United States to unleash a full nuclear retaliation to ensure the Soviet Union can no longer threaten the world. He also ordered the country implement nuclear defense protocols and prepare for a devastating loss of life. The mood was somber, but all those present knew there was no alternative left."
 
 cubamc.26.d:0 "Senior military commanders informed the Politburo that the Americans were retaliating with a full-scale nuclear attack. The time for politicking or measured responses has passed. The military commanders noted that despite the imminent destruction awaiting huge swaths of the country, we still possess the means to punish them for their aggression. The Soviet Premier next ordered the Strategic Missile Forces to prepare and launch their own full-scale attack. If the Americans chose to destroy the Soviet nation, they will face similar ruin. There was no joy or discussion when the order was given, just a grim realization that everyone had done their duty, and this was the only outcome."
 cubamc.27.d:0 "The visiting Soviet delegation insisted we accept their plans to deploy strategic missiles on our island. They want to do this secretly and claim this would be a more meaningful action than a public treaty of defense as we suggested. If we agree to the Soviet request, it will strengthen our ties and demonstrate the sincerity of our people. In addition, deploying such weapons systems, even secretly, would likely give us the benefits of a defense treaty but avoid the American scrutiny and interference which would surely follow if a formal treaty were signed. However, if the Americans were to discover these secretly deployed weapons, they would paint us as a Soviet puppet, hurting our revolutionary credentials. We must decide to either accept the secret deployment of strategic missiles or inform the delegation we want a mutual defense treaty."
 cubamc.28.d:0 "Following an intense and extensive aerial bombing campaign meant to neutralize Soviet missile sites and Cuban defenses, the United States announced its forces were now landing in Cuba. The United States seeks to neutralize the Cuban government and ensure its people and land are not used as a launching pad to inflict untold destruction on the American people. The Soviet government is said to be formulating a response while it remains unknown how many casualties they or the Cubans received in the initial bombings. Cuban leader Fidel Castro defiantly announced his forces would resist and called on all Cubans to join the defense of the island from imperialist aggression. The United States believes it had to act following the discovery of secret Soviet nuclear missile sites being built on Cuba, which is less than a hundred miles from American soil."
 cubamc.29.d:0 "With American immaturity rearing its ugly head over the situation in Cuba and them claiming we interfered in their sphere of influence, we decided to return their actions in kind. Allied occupied Berlin is within the heart of the socialist world and thus interferes in our sphere of influence. We recently directed local commanders to occupying and evict the occupying forces from their section of Berlin. Thankfully the enemy commanders realized their situation and they stood down with no violence. We will repatriate them back to NATO territory. The taking of Berlin is being well-received by the people and the NATO allies of the United States are reportedly infuriated that American adventurism led to the fall of Allied occupied Berlin."
