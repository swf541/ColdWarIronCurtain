  BEL49_Election.0.d:0 "The 1949 election is heavily contested between the Christian Social Party’s nominee, Gaston Eyskens, a member of the Belgian House of Representatives, and Paul-Henri Spaak, the incumbent Prime Minister since 1947, representing the Belgian Socialist Party. Who will the people choose?"
  BEL49.1.d:0 "During the German occupation of Belgium, many citizens turned to assistance with their captors rather than resist, creating feuding political parties and groups such as the Flemish VNV, DeVlag, and the Rex Party. 15,000 Belgians served in two separate SS divisions, including the 28th SS \"Wallonien\" Division, composed mostly of French-speaking fascists. Now that the war is over, and Belgium is not under the German boot, we must quickly hasten to prosecute and convict all of the estimated 53,000 Belgians that worked for our occupiers."
  BEL49.2.d:0 "In addition to our continued prosecution and conviction efforts of all former German collaborators within our borders, we will continue to repress all sort of right-wing activity, limiting the freedoms and rights of those suspected of working for the Germans. They will be labeled as traitors, as they very well should be, for cowing to the oppressors and murderers of our people. No collaborator will ever be the same, so that they must live with what they’ve done."
  BEL49.3.d:0 "The Koningskwestie, or \"Royal Question\" is a major political crisis, surrounding the legitimacy of the King of the Belgians, Leopold III. During the German invasion of Belgium in 1940, the King and his government came into contention, with Leopold taking control of the army and exhibiting extremely authoritarian tendencies, being placed under house arrest while under German occupation, and eventually being deported to Germany in 1944. After the war, Leopold was forced to turn to Switzerland for exile. The people remain stoutly in conflict on whether the King should be allowed to return and resume his duties, or whether he should remain in exile."
  BEL49.4.d:0 "Without any consultation or semblance of democratic authority, the Christian Social Party, led by Gaston Eyskens, has decided to allow Leopold III, King of the Belgians, to return from exile in Switzerland to Brussels. It is not known what caused this decision to take place, but the King is expected to arrive within a matter of days. This will no doubt cause high levels of tension, particularly in Wallonia, but the CSP seems to have taken this into consideration when making their decision."
  BEL49.5.d:0 "After a successful victory in the royal referendum by his supporters, the King has returned to Brussels, landing at Brussels Airport to a crowd of loving subjects. It is expected that there will be hundreds of protests in Wallonia and Brussels, brought upon by the anti-royalist coalition, decrying the arrival of the supposedly authoritarian and former collaborating king. This will no doubt spark continued political tension but Leopold is expected to give a speech in Brussels city center and quickly resume his duties as King."
  BEL49.6.d:0 "With the end of the referendum and the victory by the anti-royalist coalition, led by the Belgian Socialist Party, the Belgian government has officially denied the King any of his previous constitutional duties, those that he completely lost in 1940 with the German invasion. This prevents King Leopold from having any authority or duties within the government, and presents a great victory for anti-royalist supporters. Celebrations are occurring around the country, especially in Wallonia, where the majority of the vote came from, although small counter-protests are expected in the coming days."
  BEL49.7.d:0 "With the large majority of leftist support in the Senate with the victory of the BSP, the role of Belgium’s largest trade union, the FGTB-ABVV, becomes even more significant. Formed in 1945 between the Belgian Trade Union Confederation, the communist Belgian Association of Unity Syndicates, and various other unions and syndicates, the Algemeen Belgisch Vakverbond or Fédération Generale du Travail de Belgique has flexed its muscle through its 5-year lifespan. The government’s willingness to empower the FGTB-ABVV represents better communication between the state and its economic base."
  BEL50_Election.0.d:0 "The snap 1950 elections come at a particularly tough time in Belgian politics. The CSP’s nominee, Jean Duvieusart, a former member of the Belgian House and Senate, as well as Minister of Economic Affairs, sets off against Max Buset, president of the Belgian Socialist Party. Who will the people choose?"
  BEL50.1.d:0 "Having not properly settled the Royal Question, and sensing the particular level of displeasure from the people, the Belgian Senate elected to begin a vote of no confidence on the Prime Minister, Jean Duvieusart. Receiving only minimal opposition from several CSP hardliners, the motion introduced by several BSP legislators passed in a landslide, setting in motion the removal of Duvieusart and the search for a new PM."
  BEL50.2.d:0 "With CSP dominance in the government and the return of Leopold III in Belgium once again, it seems fitting that the King resume his duties as enshrined in the 1831 constitution as the law provides. After a brief oath ceremony, the National Institute of Radio Broadcasting, the national radio provider, broadcast the King’s speech to the entire nation."
  BEL50.3.d:0 "Desperate to find a replacement after voting Jean Duvieusart from his position as Prime Minister, the CSP has nominated Joseph Pholien. A veteran of World War I, as well as the Minister of Justice in 1939 before the German invasion, Pholien is capable of powerful leadership. Set to be confirmed in the coming days, Pholien will be Prime Minister, hopefully for longer than his predecessor."
  BEL50.4.d:0 "Under tremendous pressure from the previous Duvieusart government, Leopold announced on August 1 that he would be abdicating, leaving his rule in the place of his son, Baudouin. It is suspected that this was done to relieve tension in Wallonia and the entire country from his return to Belgium and his somewhat infamous legacy during World War II. This may please some, but he will also be missed."
  BEL50.5.d:0 "After his father’s abdication in August, the Crown Prince, Baudouin I of Belgium has taken the crown of the King of the Belgians, along with all constitutional powers associated with it. His father Leopold having signed his abdication the day before, crowds gathered in Brussels to see the coronation and following speech, where the new King promised to respect the government and the laws and wishes of the Belgian people. However, it was important to mention the several disturbances during his speech, including one shouted by the communist leader Julien Lahaut, known for his revolutionary beliefs. Celebrations continue tonight all around Belgium after this most exciting day."
  BEL50.6.d:0 "With the Royal Question settled, a new King, and a new Prime Minister, the Repressie must be loosened. The harsh treatment of collaborators cannot be completely stopped for our national security and the legacy of the War continues on, but such barbaric measures such as death sentences and public shamings must be slowly taken out of the culture."
  BEL50.7.d:0 "With the sudden departure of Joseph Pholien as Prime Minister after only a year and a half, the Christian Social Party has nominated Jean Marie Joseph, Baron van Houtte, a former professor of law at Ghent University and Minister of Finance under both Jean Duvieusart and Joseph Pholien’s governments. Set to be confirmed in the coming days, van Houtte is hopefully expected to serve for longer than his two predecessors, offering strong leadership to Belgium."
  BEL50.8.d:0 "Sensing the spirit of postwar cooperation with our allies and the need for mutual assistance and security of Western Europe, the Belgian General Staff has authorized a major defense review, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the Belgian Armed Forces and setting major targets for the future. After months of study, the report’s authors concluded the major threat being the actions of the Soviet Union and its satellite states in the Western European region, and set targets for an expansion of the military, to three active divisions, two reserve divisions, 400 aircraft and fifteen ships, as well as numerous anti-air defense units, radar, and command systems."
  BEL50.9.d:0 "The treatment of our citizens accused of being German collaborators must stop. The government will continue prosecuting and convicting collaborators, but the cultural tradition of publicly shaming those people, including shaving their heads and locking them in makeshift zoos and stocks. The stigmas associated with these citizens must stop, although they will be prosecuted for their crimes accordingly."
  BEL50.10.d:0 "Our policy of liberalization concerning collaborators has proven ineffective at both reigning in public discontent and allowing the free passage of justice of former German collaborators. The Repressie, as it is known, must be increased, only slightly, to finish the job of cleaning up the mess of former German war criminals in our country."
  BEL50.11.d:0 "In response to the Royal Question, and amidst simmering political tensions in Brussels in the government, several large trade unions in Wallonia, including the FGTB, have organized mass strikes and protests against the return of the King, as well as the lack of labor reforms concerning industry. These strikes have no likely end point and it is up to the government to figure out how to deal with them before things get excessively violent."
  BEL50.12.d:0 "In response to socialist and anti-royalist protests in Wallonia, the local government has dispatched the gendarmerie to make sure that the protests are peaceful. Donning riot gear and shields, the police took up station in main squares in Liege, Charleroi, and Brussels, watching the protestors move forward, countering them. Some protests turned violent, and a few police and protestors were injured in various scuffles. Generally, the political situation has been fairly nonviolent, but contempt of the government from socialists has increased."
  BEL50.13.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, the recently elected government, led by the Belgian Socialist Party, has offered little resistance to the massive strikes and protests taking place primarily in Wallonia, Brussels, and Liege. This event has left political scientists and spectators amazed, and public opinion towards the government has increased, with a government representative speaking of incoming labor negotiations in the coming days. Local police have been advised to keep an eye on protests to prevent further violence, but little is expected, aside from some monarchist resistance."
  BEL50.14.d:0 "Efforts by local gendarmeries to prevent the violence have failed. The CSP-led government, seeking the need to control the riots before a further conflict takes place, have asked the Belgian General Staff to deploy several divisions of the Belgian Land Component to major cities. All units are regular military personnel and conscripts, and include the 2nd Infantry Division, deployed to Liege, and the 6th Infantry Division, deployed to Brussels. Reserves will not be called up, but the soldiers deployed will be tasked with maintaining order and martial law, if the government deploys it."
  BEL50.15.d:0 "In the midst of the peaceful socialist protests and strikes, monarchist counter-protestors have disturbed and done damage to the people and their demands. The BSP government has declared that \"all monarchist protestors interfering in the peaceful protest of workers will be arrested\". Already, several hundred monarchists have been arrested and detained, either by the local police or by protestors taking the law into their own hands."
  BEL50.16.d:0 "Infamous communist leader Julien Lahaut has been assassinated outside his residence in the town of Seraing by two unknown gunmen. This may have been precipitated by the regency of Prince Baudouin, who, while taking the oath of regency, was interrupted by a communist deputy who yelled \"Vive le republique!\". The deputy was thought to be Lahaut, whose actions during the Royal Question have sparked anger among monarchists. Lahaut’s death has been blamed on monarchists, and a massive funeral is set to be held soon, attracting up to 300,000 people. More strikes are planned, as the left becomes more angry in the time of widespread political violence."
  BEL54_Election.0.d:0 "After the settlement of the Royal Question, the country seems to have stabilized. The CSP’s nominee, Jean van Houtte, the current Prime Minister and a former professor of law at Ghent University and Minister of Finance under both Jean Duvieusart and Joseph Pholien’s governments. The BSP’s nominee is Achille van Acker, Prime Minister from 1945-1946 and leader of the Belgian Labor Party. Who will the people choose?"
  BEL54.1.d:0 "The Flemish Diamond is the Flemish reference to a network of four metropolitan areas in Belgium, including Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, and Leuven. This area is the most industrialized and urbanized in Belgium, comparable to the Ruhr Valley or Randstad in the Netherlands. Covering around 51 miles, the Diamond also features many institutes of higher education, such as Hasselt University and the University of Ghent."
  BEL54.2.d:0 "Belgian beer production has been vastly improved upon and is catching steam on the world stage. The national beer industry brews many different styles of beer, including Trappist beers, Abbey beers, Pils, white ales, and Flemish red beers. More than 80% of Belgian beer is imported, produced by companies such as Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, and Leffe. Festivals are organized throughout Belgium, including the Weekend of Belgian Beers and the Karakterbieren Festival."
  BEL54.3.d:0 "Henri Moreau de Melen, the famous veteran of the Korean War and commander of the Belgian Battalion of the United Nations Command, has been awarded by the Belgian Minister of Defense. Colonel de Melen, before his participation in Korea, served in World War II, becoming a POW, then becoming a senator and then Minister of Justice from 1948-1949. During the government of Joseph Pholien, de Melen served as Minister of Defense, making the decision to deploy troops to Korea. Becoming disillusioned in the midst of the Royal Question, de Melen resigned his position and enlisted into the battalion, becoming its commanding officer. He served with dignity and will be hailed as a hero throughout Belgium."
  BEL54.4.d:0 "The Second de Taeye Act, named after the Minister of Health and Minister of the Family, Alfred de Taeye, was enacted. This law gives compensation to cities and municipalities for demolition permits, which allows local governments to buy land and destroy the buildings there, being allowed to sell the rubble for a profit. This law has faced much protest for giving too much power to governments and allowing low-income housing to be destroyed, but supporters argue the economic benefits and profits that cities will gain, culminating in less taxes for all."
  BEL54.5.d:0 "A major mining disaster took place in the Bois du Cazier coal mine in Marcinelle, Hainaut Province in Wallonia. Caused by a failure of a hoist mechanism and subsequent underground fire, 262 miners died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Rescue operations continued until 23 August, with only 12 survivors. A large majority of the dead were Italian guest workers, in addition to 95 Belgians and various other Europeans. Italy has immediately asked for better working conditions and the management at the mine will be investigated for negligence."
  BEL54.6.d:0 "In response to the continuation of separate Catholic schooling by the Christian Social Party, the Belgian Socialist Party and the Liberal Party have organized mass protests in the major cities, in response to an announcement by the government. These protests are mostly taking place in Brussels, as well as Liege, Antwerp, and Ghent, focusing on strictly secular education, with some protestors making signs and some holding their small children in the air. Some students have also attended the protests, recounting their experiences in Catholic schools and urging the government to adopt secular measures. It is unclear whether this will have any effect on the current decision, but time will tell."
  BEL54.7.d:0 "The education laws put into place by Minister of Education Pierre Harmel during the term of Joseph Pholien have been repealed by the majority BSP government! This will allow secular schooling, as well as a major separation of church and state in the school system. It is not clear if or when there will be a replacement for the Harmel education laws, but the streets are erupting with joy. Many CSP members and Catholics are rumbling about these developments, and there are talks of protests in the coming days, both in secular and religious circles. This may turn into another cycle of political violence once again."
  BEL54.8.d:0 "Even though the Harmel education laws have been repealed, protests continue throughout the country, even by socialists who argue the non-existence of an education law only benefits the Catholic schools. Protests are continuing, especially in Brussels, where BSP protestors are clashing with CSP counter-protestors, resulting in a few scuffles and arrests by armed police. It is the government’s opinion that the socialist and liberal protests should be stopped, and police have been called up to disperse crowds and invoke a curfew if applicable."
  BEL54.9.d:0 "Even though the Harmel education laws have been repealed, protests continue throughout the country, even by Catholics who argue the constitutionality of limiting private, religious schools.. Protests are continuing, especially in Brussels, where CSP protestors are clashing with BSP counter-protestors, resulting in a few scuffles and arrests by armed police. It is the government’s opinion that the Catholic and conservative protests should be stopped, and police have been called up to disperse crowds and invoke a curfew if applicable."
  BEL54.10.d:0 "The Collard Act, named after the current Minister of Education and BSP member Leo Collard, provides subsidy cuts to the Belgian education network and removes approximately 110 Catholic intermediaries from the system, as well as an increase in teacher salaries and provisions for technical schools and freedom of choice. This is seen by many as a suitable alternative to the now defunct Harmel education laws, which unfairly gave an advantage to Catholic schools. This law will face much protest but in all likelihood will provide a brighter future for Belgium’s schoolchildren."
  BEL58_Election.0.d:0 "The 1958 regular election is contested between the CSP's nominee, Gaston Eyskens, and the BSP nominee, Achille van Acker. Eyskens is a previous Prime Minister and economist, while van Acker is also a previous Prime Minister during the late 1940s. Who will the people choose?"
  BEL58.1.d:0 "With the transition from the European Coal and Steel Community to the new European Economic Community, the overall price of coal is becoming cheaper with greater transportation between countries. Our coal industry must remain constant, and the Government feels obliged to decrease prices in order to remain competitive with other markets. Our industry is beginning a drawdown, but in the meantime, it must remain."
  BEL58.2.d:0 "The School Pact, the agreement solving the Second School War, is the result of work carried out in September 1958 by the National School Commission and negotiations between the BSP, CSP, and Liberal Parties. It is a contract solving the issues of education in Belgium, and stipulates the freedom of choice in schools, the clear distinction between public and private school, and the prohibition of political activities in schools."
  BEL58.3.d:0 "The government has been alerted of outbreaks of civil disorder in the capital of the Belgian Congo, Leopoldville. The rioting began after members of ABAKO, or the Alliance des Bakongo political party, were not allowed to gather for a protest concerning Belgian atrocities in the Congo. The violence is beginning to strike the common people, with parts of the city being looted and burned. A response is needed as soon as possible."
  BEL58.4.d:0 "The Force Publique, the gendarmerie and police force of the Belgian Congo, have been deployed to respond to the mass riots in Leopoldville. Led by General Emille Janssens, the 13th FP Battalion is authorized to use lethal force in order to quell protests, assault, and looting. This should only be a temporary measure in order to stop further protests and violence."
  BEL58.5.d:0 "In the wake of the riots in Leopoldville, sensing general discontent with Belgian colonial rule, and following the lead of other colonial powers, the Belgian House of Representatives has convened to hold public hearings on the Ministry of Colonies and their actions in recent memory, including possible atrocities. As well, thoughts must be considered of Congolese independence in the very near future. It is the hope that these hearings will uncover the truth."
  BELFA.1.d:0 "On November 5, 1955, the Benelux Parliament was formed in conjunction with the Benelux Economic Union. Designed as an advisory group only with no decision-making power to enact legislation, the Parliament is composed of 49 members; 21 each from Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as 7 representatives from Luxembourg. The chair alternates between the three countries every two years, beginning in Brussels with Frans van Cauelwart as the first chairman of the assembly."
  BELFA.2.d:0 "As an augmentation of the 1944 and 1947 updated customs agreement between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the three countries have signed into force the establishment of the Benelux Economic Union. Using the Benelux Parliament as an advisory body, the union has committed itself to free movement of people, goods, and services between the three countries."
  BELFA.3.d:0 "During the 1956 Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom held right here in Belgium, discussions on a European nuclear energy community took place. With the signing of the Euratom Treaty during the Treaties of Rome in 1957, the European Atomic Energy Community, known as Euratom, was established to create a single common market for nuclear power."
  BELFA.4.d:0 "With the beginning of the war on the Korean peninsula and passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 84, authorizing the formation of a unified command, Belgium sees it fit to contribute as many men as possible to the ongoing police action. Up to 2,000 eligible men have arrived in Leopoldsburg in order to join the command, and they must be inspected and trained. As early as 1951, the BUNC will be able to deploy to Korea."
  BELFA.5.d:0 "The unsanctioned and unjust invasion of South Korea by the Soviet-backed North Korean People’s Army is unacceptable. The government of Belgium wishes to convey its condemnation of the conflict, a spokesperson remarked in a press conference on the situation. There are no plans by the Belgian Ministry of Defense to send any troops to assist in United Nations operations at this time, the spokesperson also said."
  BELFA.6.d:0 "As the Netherlands received much more damage during the 1953 North Sea flood than in Belgium, we will do our very best to support our Dutch brothers to the north. Soldiers have been sent to assist in rescues, as well as the establishment of a National Relief Fund. All funds of the Belgian Red Cross will go towards both domestic and Dutch flood reconstruction."
  BELFA.7.d:0 "The city of Brussels is proud to host the 1958 World’s Fair, known informally as \"Expo 58\". The first major international expo held after World War II, the Expo was most well-known for the large Atomium, as well as the Belgian Congo pavilion and pavilions of various countries such as the United States, Soviet Union, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. More than 41 million visitors attended over six months, making it quite an impressive World’s Fair."
  BELFA.8.d:0 "In preparation for the Brussels World’s Fair taking place soon, the Belgian government has commissioned the construction of a new building, named the Atomium, that is in the shape of an iron crystal cell. With its signature metal spheres connected by various staircases, the Atomium will become a monument for the city of Brussels, although it is not expected to live past the end of the World’s Fair."
  BELColonial.1.d:0 "The colonial history of Belgium has been fraught with cruelty and controversy. Of the three colonies and three concessions that Belgium owns or owned, the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi are the most infamous. First being solely owned by King Leopold II in the 1880s, the Congo was returned to Belgium in 1908, after years of violence by Congo Free State officials, who used forced labor, murder, and mutilation to maintain control and the flow of rubber and uranium from the colonies. Participation in the Second World War by the Congolese greatly helped the East African campaign. The colony of Ruanda-Urundi is also significant, gained in 1922 after World War I and now made a UN trust territory administered by Belgium. Maintaining this small but mighty colonial empire is a challenge, and looking at neighboring colonial powers, such as France, keeping our colonies stable and modernized will certainly be a feat of man."
  BELColonial.2.d:0 "After the Second World War, it is clear that the Congo needs a new economic plan, and fast, to accelerate new modern economic potential. Beginning in 1949, a Ten Year Plan was established, to focus on rapid investment and construction of transport infrastructure, to replace aging systems. A \"Société de Développement Colonial\" will be established within the colony to coordinate strategic goals, and with the introduction of new manufacturing processes, the industrial production rate in the colonies will only increase, helping to supply countries across the world."
  BELColonial.3.d:0 "The Central Bank of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, or CBBCRU, on 1 July 1952, has formed a central colonial bank and a more stable financial future in the colonies. Prior to this, the Bank of England has assumed responsibility for bank note issuance, due to Belgium|'|s tenuous history of German occupation, particularly during the Second World War. This will finally place currency in the people|’|s hands, not a foreign power, and will unite the African colonies, making it easier for loans or bonds to be taken out regardless of the location."
  BELColonial.4.d:0 "Belgian native policy is changing surrounding the political and economic freedoms of our colonial subjects in the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. The new Royal Decree of 14 July 1952 allows greater political freedom throughout the colonies, including the creation of a great number of political institutions, such as provincial, district, and municipal native representatives, all the way up to a High Council, all designed for more self-government among the indigenous people and less foreign interference by the colonial government, although some vestiges must remain for territorial security and well-being. It is the hope of the king that this decree is not abused, but used freely to promote democratic ideals."
  BELColonial.5.d:0 "His first major undertaking as royal, King Baudouin has conducted a state visit to the Belgian Congo, visiting major cities such as Leopoldville, Stanleyville, and Albertville. During his visit, he seemed enthusiastic, as well as countless crowds cheering him on as he toured the streets. In a speech given in the capital of Leopoldville, the king remarked upon the Governor-General|'|s ideas on a \"Belgo-Congolese community\". Foreign observers are noticing that all seems normal during the visit, even though in the shadows, rumblings of union rights, linguistic differences, and education - issues that affect Belgium domestically; are starting to hit the colonies."
  BELColonial.6.d:0 "Discussions of wage gaps between white Europeans and black indigenous workers have hit the very heart of the colonial government. This has stemmed from the influx of educated Congolese, who are demanding equal pay for all and have formed the Auxiliary Civil Servants Trade Union, or APIC, to solve this issue. As well, the wage issue, affecting most native Congolese, is entwining itself with a popular emancipation movement, which presents a security threat to the colonial government. Negotiations have been set up immediately between the Governor-General’s Office and the APIC to discuss the wage gap and hopefully take off some of the pressure within the population."
  BELRec.1.d:0 "Since the end of the Second World War, Belgium has made much progress in recouping its losses during the German invasion and occupation from 1940-1944. Upon our liberation, welfare reforms were introduced, as well as demand for our most popular exports, including coal, steel, and textiles. Programs such as the \"Battle for Coal\" and the Gutt Plan increased coal production and reduced the money supply respectively. The labor shortage in Belgium is still a large issue, and there is still more work to be done. Our economy is improving but could be better, and we must continue to work towards that lofty goal."
  BELRec.2.d:0 "Belgium has sent a diplomatic contingent to sign the Treaty of Paris, which is set to form the European Coal and Steel Community, the first inter-European governmental body and open economic market. France’s Jean Monnet is set to be the ECSC’s first chairman of the High Authority, with Belgium being represented by Paul Finet, former general secretary of the ABVV trade union and politician. It is our hope that this partnership will heavily help our economy as our imports of coal and steel are needed throughout the Continent."
  BELRec.3.d:0 "As a part of the Mutual Assistance Plan offered by the United States, known as the Marshall Plan, Belgium is set to receive approximately $777 million in total in aid, which will be used towards infrastructure improvements, improvements in industry and manufacturing processes, as well as maintaining our welfare system, currency amount, and exports."
  BELRec.4.d:0 "Developed by none other than Paul-Henri Spaak, the Treaty of Rome has been signed in Rome today, with representatives from West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg present. This is a pivotal founding document for European cooperation, as it outlines the basic structure of a body known as the \"European Union\". We hope that this treaty will only expand the ECSC and allow greater economic freedom throughout Europe among allies."
  BELRec.5.d:0 "We have persevered through the worst of the recovery and are now greatly improving. Our economy has become the strongest in its history, and with the help of the ECSC and now the EEC, the signing of the Treaty of Rome and the eventual integration into this European Union, we have recovered. More is yet to come in the future, with changing times."
  BELFlavor.1.d:0 "Georges Prosper Remi, more commonly known as Herge, is a Belgian cartoonist best known for his comic series, the Adventures of Tintin; considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. Born in Brussels, Herge first forayed into cartooning by illustrating the Belgian Scouting magazine Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Revolving around the travels of reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, as well as other various characters, Tintin was used as conservative propaganda to children, using travels to the Soviet Union as anti-socialist propaganda and presenting the native Congolese in the Belgian Congo as childlike idiots. After the German invasion of Belgium in 1940, Herge worked for a collaborationist newspaper and faced criticism after the war for supporting the Germans. In 1950, Studios Herge was founded to facilitate easier production of Tintin comics, especially coloring."
  BELFlavor.2.d:0 "After World War II, the Belgian comics scene split into two major groups, Dutch Flemish and French Wallonian, with the latter being massively more popular in series such as Tintin and Spirou in main magazines. Other competitors include daily newspaper comics in Flanders and French-language paper supplements. This is commonly referred to as the Golden Age of Belgian comics, featured by a period of constant growth and expansion."
  BELFlavor.3.d:0 "While not as popular as their French-language counterparts, the small Flemish comics scene is still significant to Belgium. No local magazines would be able to equal the success of Tintin or Spirou, but some went independent, such as ‘t Kapoentje as well as Jommeke, who debuted in 1955. Some Flemish designers, following in the steps of Berck, turned to working for French-language magazines instead."
  BELFlavor.4.d:0 "Belgian television has existed since 1953, under the purview of the Institut national belge de radiodiffusion (INR) or the Belgian National Broadcasting Institute. Formed by law in June 1930, the INR was responsible for Belgian radio until the German invasion, when it was forced to stop broadcasting. However, some personnel were able to escape and formed Radio Belgique in England under the Office de Radiodiffusion Nationale Belge, or RNB. After the war, the INR and RNB existed together until they were merged by Royal Decree in 1945 under the INR. Since then, the INR has contributed to the foundation of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950, and began television broadcasting in 1953, with two hours of programming daily."
  BELFlavor.5.d:0 "The first plans for a metro subway system in Brussels came as early as the 1890s. After the end of the Second World War, more support to make underground rail lines grew as more space would be available for above-ground motor traffic. Due to the ever-growing number of traffic jams between cars and trams, the Societe des Transports Intercommunaux des Bruxelles / Maatschappij voor het Intercommunaal Vervoer te Brussel (STIB/MIVB) was formed in 1954 to operate the tram, bus, and subway networks in Brussels."
  BELFlavor.6.d:0 "The pavilion of the United States of America at Expo 58 is quite spacious, designed by architect Edward Durell Stone. Featuring a concert venue for the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra and University of California Marching Band as well as a 360 degree movie attraction known as Circarama, the pavilion had plenty of features. In 1959, this pavilion would appear again at the American National Exhibition in Moscow before returning to the United States to Disneyland in Anaheim, California."
  BELFlavor.7.d:0 "In contrast to the American pavilion, the pavilion of the Soviet Union is a similarly large and impressive building, which was folded up and returned to Russia at the end of the exhibition. Features included a model of the Lenin nuclear icebreaker and Soviet automobiles GAZ-13 Chaika and GAZ-53 truck. Awarded with a Grand Prix award, the pavilion also had a model of the Sputnik satellite which mysteriously disappeared, leading to accusations that it was stolen by the United States."
  BELFlavor.8.d:0 "King Baudouin’s visit to the Congo in 1959 presented a sharp contrast to his previous visit four years before in 1955. After making his speech on 13 January promising Congolese independence, the king was pelted with rocks upon arriving in Leopoldville by black citizens angry with the imprisonment of Patrice Lumumba.
