Post-war, the OH-58 would receive many modifications, with an engine upgrade (bringing it up to par with the later OH-58C), a thermal imaging system, a communications package for law enforcement, enhanced navigational equipment and high skid gear. These upgraded variants of the 'Kiowa' (named for a Native American tribe originally from Montana and Colorado) would take part in the Army National Guard's RAID Anti-Drug operations."
