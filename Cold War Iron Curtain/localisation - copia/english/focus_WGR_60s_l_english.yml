 WGR_found_the_gsg9_desc:0 "As a consequence of the mismanagement of the 1972 Olympic tragedy, the West German government created the GSG 9 under the leadership of then Oberstleutnant Ulrich Wegener so that similar situations in the future could be responded to adequately and professionally. Many German politicians oppose its formation, fearing GSG 9 would rekindle memories of the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel (SS). The decision was taken to form the unit from police forces, as opposed to from the military, like the equivalent forces in other countries, on the ground that German federal law expressly forbids the use of the military forces against the civilian population."

 WGR_Establish_the_Ministry_of_Health_desc:0 "With the economy skyrocketing during the Wirtschaftswunder, Germany quickly transformed into a welfare state. This offered her citizens easy access to various supportive measures should they ever experience dire times. A major element of this concept is the healthcare system and its mandatory health insurance for workers and officials. By now, it has become an ever-growing task to organize and maintain such a bureaucratic juggernaut. Consequentially, the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (Federal Ministry of Health) shall be established under the purview of our Minister of Health. It is tasked with guaranteeing the stability and high quality of our healthcare system while also reining in the numerous health insurance companies."

In 1955, the foundations were laid for the Bundeswehr, the new army for a new Germany. Since then, we have come a long way to equip our forces with modern weapons, create an efficient administration and implement new tactics. At the dawn of the 60’s, rising international tensions and ever so advancing technology demand further modernizations, improved organizational structures and most importantly further expansion of the Bundeswehr. „Wir.

So far, we have invested a lot of money and effort to rebuild and expand the road system, but there sure is potential for even more improvement!

 WGR_Expand_North_German_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The revival of Germany’s industrial heartland in Nordrhein-Westfalen was an utter success. At steady pace, new factories are built, companies founded, and workplaces created. While this development is most welcoming, our economy will only continue growing when produced goods can be efficiently transported to purchasers. While national distribution of consumer goods is important, quick access to the export and import hotspots in the ports of Hamburg or Bremen are just as crucial for keeping up with international competition and keeping our own industry supplied with foreign materials. It is therefore in our best interest to further improve the infrastructure in the North."

These days, the sight of rarely any buildings triggers the memories of the disastrous destruction mere fifteen years ago. But in this new age of technology, our architects should go above and beyond themselves and not only recreate the former cityscape but modernize it! An excellent example for such efforts is the recently inaugurated metro stop Ritterstrasse in Hamburg. With the continuously growing metro system of our largest city, the masses can travel to and depart from this commercial arcade with ease, providing the stores and shops with waves of new costumers. And, of course, the government with additional tax income."

Starting in the 14th century with the “Hanse”, a trading cooperation between the large port cities of Hamburg, Bremen, Rostock and Lübeck, these towns have experienced a massive increase in economic and political power over centuries within the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire. During World War II, their commercial role and strategic importance as the birthplaces of the Kriegsmarine brought massive destruction with it. Our recent reconstruction efforts saw the revival of piers and docks, but the continued economic growth, combined with an increased need for export and import capacity, demands a second expansion of our ports in Hamburg, Bremen, and Kiel.

Aside our citizens, the industry is also to be provided with fresh, clean running water. Production often involves water cooling, or the liquid itself as a base for other goods. And let us not forget about agriculture…well, the list goes on. For a fact, it is an imperative that a reliable, hygienic, and durable water infrastructure exists in Germany, reaching to even the most rural areas. While we do have such system already, there is still room for major improvements. What kind of industrial nation in the first world would we be without universal access to clean water?"

 WGR_Hannover_Medical_School_desc:0 "With the continued expansion of our Healthcare System, we are in dire need of new medical staff. Although a new medical university in Hannover should provide more than enough capacity for the near future, founding director Professor Rudolf Schoen demands a reformed medical curriculum. One major change in young doctors’ education will be “learning next to the patients’ bed”, as he put it. In other words, Prof. Schoen suggests a stronger emphasis on practical and social skills contrary to the almost exclusively theoretic approach of the past. This will result in a better quality of treatment, and a closer bond between the gods in white and their patients."

With the Marshal Plan and the Wirtschaftswunder, this important mainstay of our economy has returned once more. Although in the case of West Berlin, the isolated and besieged city state has a major problem: Factories need to be supplied with material, which is hard to come by when surrounded by closed borders. Consequentially the newest economic sector of our modern times has found its way to the old capital: The tertiary sector. Offices for information, marketing and communication are founded in record time. Those do not need many resources, but masses of willing white-collar workers and a few managers."

 WGR_Establish_Nature_Parks_desc:0 "The rapid industrialization in the 19th century and continued growth during the first half of the 20th century did not pass without leaving deep scars on nature. Forests were cut down to create additional area for agriculture, wetlands were dried up for new settlements, rivers channeled for better shipping routes and so on. What little remains of truly untouched nature in Germany is threatened by pollution, tourists, and further exploitation. Suggested by various groups and initiatives for some time now, nature parks shall be established to properly protect various ecosystems which present unique compositions, qualities, or species. Not only do we owe that to mother nature and the national heritage; our citizens will be thankful for preserving the beauty of nature for them and future generations to enjoy!"

In the States, he learned about new business strategies and imported this knowledge to Germany where Berger’s fresh ideas were met with fascination. Soon, a major assignment by the large travel agency Touropa presented the golden opportunity for his office to enter the international stage. Over the years, the focus changed from Marketing (selling products and services) to Strategy (achieving business goals). These days, it is one of the largest consultant agencies worldwide."

Although the advent of television is changing the information market, almost every German household and car is equipped with a radio. With such a large audience, the government eagerly established a public service broadcast branch in the ether: The Westdeutscher Rundfunk 3 (West German Broadcast 3). Inspired by the third radio programme of the BBC, the third programme of the WDR is aimed towards the more sophisticated listener.

What was dubbed the Republikflucht is the reaction to low living standards, economic instability, and repression in the East. To counter this increasingly problematic trend, a simple yet crude solution was realized on August 13th, 1961, by the regime in East Berlin. A wall was built to separate West Germany from East Germany, while West Berlin was completely walled in, isolated in the red sphere. The official reason for this action was stated as “protection from fascist influence”, but obviously presented the DDR’s desperate attempt to prevent mass emigration. The reaction of our allies to this division was so far disappointing, merely consisting of pro forma reprehension. But our party shall shout out loudly what every German thinks of this atrocious affront!"

This action resulted in a political scandal for the sitting party CDU and was heavily condemned by various groups and students. After much turmoil, including the protest resignation of five ministers, the Minister of Defense Franz Josef Strauß (CDU) abdicated, two state secretaries in charge of the prosecution were fired, the arrested journalists were freed, and Chancellor Adenauer had to form a new cabinet. This resulted in a decisive political power loss for the CDU and was praised as a major victory for the freedom of press."

Quite contrary, the ESCS signatories of France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg vowed to share a common market for coal and steel to stop competition over natural resources.

Although mostly successful, Adenauer also dropped a few bricks for being a rather pigheaded fellow. Being the most noteworthy, the infamous Spiegel Affair was the catalyst for his resignation on October 15th, 1963. In addition, his advanced age of 87 years also called for temperance. One day after the formal abdication, the former Minister of Economy and father of the Wirtschaftswunder Ludwig Erhard was nominated as Adenauer’s successor."
