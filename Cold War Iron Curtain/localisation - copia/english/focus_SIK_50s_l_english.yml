 ETR.100.d:0 "We have sent a confidential message to the governor of Sinkiang from the Soviet Union. It tells the governor if he agrees to form a coalition with our state and then proclaim independence, the Soviets will promise our protection. The Soviet offer, if accepted, would likely free our people from the yoke of China. However, opponents to the offer point out it may just replace Chinese domination with Russian. More importantly, it appears the Soviets would try to acquire rights to our rich natural resources. But at the same time, that may be the cost for freedom."
 ETR.105.d:0 "The Soviet Union has been a friend to the East Turkestan Republic at times but its interests do change at certain times. Since 1945 they have held our former President Elihan Tore under house arrest. The Soviets thought he was too independent thinking and militant during a time they were pursuing peace efforts in the region. To solidify our state and demonstrate we can talk with the Soviets as equals, we have sent a request for the Soviet Union to release Elihan Tore."
 ETR.106.d:0 "To the delight of the East Turkestan Republic and its people, the Soviet Union announced it would release our former President Elihan Tore from house arrest. The news of his returned will no doubt delight the people and raise the profile of our government. However, the Chinese and their allies in the region are said to be quite unhappy with the Soviet action as they felt Elihan Tore will become a voice of separatism and violence in the region."
 ETR.107.d:0 "Our government recently requested the Soviet Union release from house arrest the first President of East Turkestan, Elihan Tore. It was felt that his detention and separation from his people gave made the people view the Soviet Union negatively. However, it appears the Soviet government did not heed our concerns as they declared they would not be releasing Elihan Tore. The failure of our government to bring back the former President will hurt relations with the Soviets and hurt our standing with the people."
 ETR.125.d:0 "The government of the East Turkestan Republic announced it would be reshuffling and reorganizing the National Ruling Council. Once decisions are made on which politicians and political factions will receive what positions, the nation will be informed. Our nation has different factions all vying for influence and positions, but it is hoped in the end an effective National Ruling Council will be assembled to guide the nation through this difficult time."
 ETR.20.d:0 "The Chinese government continues to put pressure on our nation both politically and on the border with troops. In order for our regime to survive and for the dreams of our people to be achieved, we must request an intervention from the Soviet Union. Soviet support will enable us to defeat whatever machinations are being plotted by the Chinese and their local sympathizers in the region. If the Soviet Union accepts our request and intervenes, it will have the love of our people and we will no doubt be receptive to Soviet needs in terms of our natural resources."
 ETR.21.d:0 "We have received crushing news today. The Soviet Union responded to our request for intervention by saying it would not intervene on our behalf. We believe the Soviets are simply not willing to alienate the Chinese as they seek closer relations. The people of the East Turkestan Republic apparently are not worthy Soviet help. This rejection confirms that the Soviet Union never cared for our cause and only used us for their interests."



#News Events
 ETR.1001.d:0 "The East Turkestan Republic today declared its independence. It stated centuries of foreign, especially Chinese occupation had come to an end. It stated it will be a homeland for the steppe people across the region. It noted the recent arrangement of a coalition government with the Chinese state had failed to aid the people in Sinkiang. The Chinese government reacted to this announcement by claiming it came from a rogue regime of foreign-born miscreants. Most likely referring to the Soviet education background of many East Turkestan Republic leaders. Many await the Soviet reaction to this announcement as their support for East Turkestan Republic independence would me a major blow to Chinese efforts at pacifying the region."
 ETR.22.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it would intervene in favor of the East Turkestan Republic (ETR). The Soviet government noted the Chinese had failed the people of the region and the only way forward will be for the people of the ETR to go their own path. Soviet support greatly bolsters the legitimacy of the ETR and its leaders were quick to praise the Soviets for their stance. Soviet forces on the border are said to be mobilizing with rumors that some units may have already crossed into the ETR. The Soviets warned that any military moves by the Chinese against the ETR will be dealt with severely. The Chinese government has yet to issue a statement following this dramatic Soviet announcement."
