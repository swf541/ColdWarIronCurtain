 USA_aam_short_range_0:0 "AIM-9B Sidewinder"
 USA_aam_short_range_0_short:0 "AIM-9B"
 USA_aam_short_range_0_desc:0 "Development of Sidewinder began in 1950 at the NOTS later renamed as NWC (Naval Weapons Center) at China Lake. The idea was to create a very simple heat-seeking air-to-air missile by equipping a 12.7 cm air-to-air rocket (based on the 5" zuni) with a lead sulphide photo cell in a hemispherical glass nose to detect IR radiation. Another simple, yet effective, idea was the use of "Rollerons" (sliptream-driven wheels at the fin trailing edges acting as stabilizing gyros) as roll-stabilizing devices. The first test missiles were fired in 1951, and on 11 September 1953, the first air-to-air hit on a drone was scored."
 USA_aam_long_range_0:0 "AIM-7D Sparrow"
 USA_aam_long_range_0_short:0 "AIM-7D"
 USA_aam_long_range_0_desc:0 "The AAM-N-6a (AIM-7D) was similar to the -6, but used a new Thiokol liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's F-110A Spectre (F-4 Phantom) fighters in 1962, known to them as the AIM-101. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built."
 USA_aam_short_range_1:0 "AIM-9E Sidewinder"
 USA_aam_short_range_1_short:0 "AIM-9E"
 USA_aam_short_range_1_desc:0 "The AIM-9E was the first version specifically developed by the USAF. It was an improved AIM-9B with a new seeker with thermoelectric (Peltier) cooling, and a higher tracking rate of 12°/s. The Peltier cooling method allowed unlimited cooling time while the missile was on the launch rail. Externally, the AIM-9E differed from the AIM-9B by its longer conical nose section. About 5000 AIM-9Bs were converted to AIM-9E. The AIM-9E-2 is a variant with a reduced-smoke motor."
 USA_aam_long_range_1:0 "AIM-7F Sparrow"
 USA_aam_long_range_1_short:0 "AIM-7F"
 USA_aam_long_range_1_desc:0 "In January 1972, Raytheon began development of the vastly improved AIM-7F. It featured a new dual-thrust (boost/sustain) rocket motor (usually a Hercules MK 58, but sometimes an Aerojet MK 65), which greatly increased the missile's range. The AIM-7F also had a completely new solid-state electronic guidance and control system (GCS), designated AN/DSQ-35, which was also compatible with modern pulse-doppler radars."
 USA_aam_short_range_2:0 "AIM-9L Sidewinder"
 USA_aam_short_range_2_short:0 "AIM-9L"
 USA_aam_short_range_2_desc:0 "In 1971, the USAF and U.S. Navy agreed to jointly develop the AIM-9L, a vastly improved Sidewinder based on the AIM-9H. Major development goals were ALASCA (All-Aspect Capability) and effective use against violently manoeuvering and high-speed targets at all ranges. All AIM-9L features resulted in a vastly improved missile which could acquire targets at all aspects, and had a much improved tracking, manoeuvering, terminal homing, and killing performance. Production started in 1978, and more than 16000 AIM-9Ls have been built."
 USA_aam_long_range_2:0 "AIM-7M Sparrow"
 USA_aam_long_range_2_short:0 "AIM-7M"
 USA_aam_long_range_2_desc:0 "The next version of the AIM-7 was the AIM-7M, whose main new feature was the new inverse monopulse seeker for look-down/shoot-down capability in a new WGU-6/B (later WGU-23/B) guidance section. he AIM-7M also has a new WDU-27/B blast-fragmentation warhead in a WAU-17/B warhead section. The first firing of a YAIM-7M occured in 1980, and the AIM-7M entered production in 1982."
 USA_aam_short_range_3:0 "AIM-9M Sidewinder"
 USA_aam_short_range_3_short:0 "AIM-9M"

It features a reduced-smoke rocket motor, an improved guidance section designated WGU-4/B, better countermeasures resistance (IRCCM - Infrared Counter-Countermeasures), and improved overall reliability. Production began in 1982, and so far more than 7000 missiles have been built by Raytheon."

They have further improved IRCM detection circuitry, and the latest versions of the rocket motor (MK 36 MOD 11), guidance section (WGU-4E/B), and AOTD (DSU-15B/B).

The NSVT is well known for being mounted on Soviet MBTs such as the 64, the 72, and the 80.\nThe 2B14 is a modern light indirect fire mortar designed in 1983 by the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant for use in airborne and light infantry forces. The weapon fires a 82mm modern mortar and has a fire rate of approximately 24 rounds per minute. Its high rate of fire and efficient logistical design made it an excellent weapon for the Soviets and saw usage well outside its intended purpose including motor rifle units. Its success was seen largely during the Afghan war."

The weapon has extensive changes over the former NSVT including a rotating bolt replacing the pivoting breech lock, an improved gas system, and reworked muzzle baffle. The gun has much less recoil giving it higher accuracy and longer sustained fire times, making it better for suppressing fire and long range fire support. It is also vastly lighter and produces a higher volume of fire. It has seen combat in a large variety of modern Russian and Russian-sphere conflicts including the Russo-Georgian war and the Syrian Civil war. There are also reports that it has been seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with the US albeit rarely.\nThe ASG-30 is a heavy grenade launcher developed in 1990 by the KBP bureau for the Soviet Union but was not adopted until after the dissolution in 1995 by the Russian federation. It fires at a rate of 400 rounds per minute and is equipped with a blowback action. Its design is based heavily off of the AGS-17 and is massively lighter, more mobile, has a longer range, and is more accurate. The launcher has gained notable prestige in its capability to take down fortified enemies. Its capability was proven in the second Chechen war where it proved to be a highly capable weapon."

It was developed to provide a modern, improved variant of the RPG-7 and is reloadable unlike the RPG-18. It fires rockets at an effective range of approximately 600 meters and is not limited by a timed warhead. It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel. This means it is not as easy to use and requires a level of protection for its user but makes it more effective.

KBM finished development of the Strela-3 in 1974 and it proved to be far more capable. Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive.

In the mid 1950s, Convair began studying the use of infrared guidance to create a portable surface to air missile system. Convair began looking at early air-to-air missiles to create their weapon and managed to scale it down to a smaller level. The Redeye was used in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan."

 USA_manpads_2_desc: "The Redeye II is an anti-air MANPADS which was developed by General Dynamics in 1967. It uses an infrared homing surface to air missile to home in on its target. It featured a higher end computer and general improvements to parts and overall design to make it more reliable. Although the Redeye II was an improvement over the Redeye I it wasn't widely manufactured and remained a prototype as most of its improvements could simply be added to the Redeye I. It can be considered that developing the Redeye II in this context is improving the computer of the Redeye I and manufacturing the better equipment."

The SG-43 used a tilting breechblock and came with an apparatus on the bottom that allowed to to be mounted on tripods, wheeled mounts, or on vehicles as a support weapon. The barrel is air-cooled and very dense making it difficult to cool in most temperatures but comes with a chromium-plated bore that can sustain them. This makes it unreliable in higher temperatures. It saw heavy usage around the end of WWII. It has been licensed to vast numbers of countries resulting it it seeing combat in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Although the weapon itself also has a track record of being involved in many, many civil wars.\nThe M1938 mortar is a 120mm soviet mortar used heavily by the Soviet army during WWII. Its design is a near-copy of the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm. The mortar itself is very easy to limber and unlimber and could move around quickly to avoid counter fire. It uses very heavy 120mm shells and had a high rate of fire, making it a strong weapon for hitting enemy encampments or infantry in heavy cover such as buildings."

 SOV_protection_equip_1_desc: "The steel bib is an extremely early model of infantry protection equipment based from the steel cuirass and was made during WWI. The breastplates themselves were implemented around 1942 and results of usage during combat were mixed. The breastplates themselves worked in infantry heavy urban environments, but were burdensome in the field."
 SOV_protection_equip_2: "SN+SSh40"
 SOV_protection_equip_2_short: "SN+SSh40"
 SOV_protection_equip_2_desc: "The SN body armor and SSh40 helmets were developed close to the end of the second world war. The helmets themselves were sturdier than their previous versions."
 SOV_protection_equip_3: "6B5-15+STSh-81"
 SOV_protection_equip_3_short: "6B5-15+STSh-81"
 SOV_protection_equip_3_desc: "The 6B5-15 vest was developed by the Stali Soviet research institute and produced from 1986-1998. The vest itself used kevlar materials to protect the user and came with a series of multicam camouflages. The STSh-81 helmets are titanium and steel helmets also produced by Stali for the Soviet Union. The STSh-81 helmets demonstrated considerable strength in combat."
 SOV_protection_equip_4: "6B7"
 SOV_protection_equip_4_short: "6B7"
 SOV_protection_equip_4_desc: "Over time, the 6B5-15 ballistic armor would need to have more and improved harnesses and accessory components. Stali set out to create a full set of modern gear setups for most environments around the world that could be manufactured at will by the Soviet Union. The 6B7 helmets were an improved version of the STSh-81 helmets and acted as successors to their former design. Stali made them with more modern materials such as an improved internal steel structure that could more effectively deflect the force coming from bullets."
 SOV_protection_equip_5: "6B45+6B47"
 SOV_protection_equip_5_short: "6B45+6B47"
 SOV_protection_equip_5_desc: "Techinkom developed the 6B5 vests and infantry equipment in the early 2000s to meet the needs of modern combat. They were more maneuverable, durable, and effective than before. They featured modern shock-absorbing plating, came with weather and moisture resistant lining, and could easily give any soldier a massive edge in infantry combat. The 6B47 helmet and its equipment attachments provide greater protection for its wearers than before offering greater protection."

 IND_support_equipment_desc:0 "A large assortment of high-quality equipment purchased from the civilian market. Medical equipment and supplies, logistics equipment, binoculars, construction equipment and tools, and various other assorted publicly available items. It's not difficult to find, order, or contract a vast majority of the support equipment used."
 IND_support_equipment_0_desc:0 "A large assortment of high-quality equipment purchased from the civilian market. Medical equipment and supplies, logistics equipment, binoculars, construction equipment and tools, and various other assorted publicly available items. It's not difficult to find, order, or contract a vast majority of the support equipment used."
 IND_motorized_equipment_1_desc:0 "A sturdy and reliable 1.5 ton 4x4 farm truck. While not as good as proper military-grade trucks, large bed farm trucks often suit their purpose just fine. Farm trucks are built with reliability in mind and capable of hauling large loads of cargo in various terrains. Farm trucks can haul fair amounts of cargo and carry up to 10 soldiers in the back. Although reliable and somewhat strong they often have trouble carrying notably heavy loads and may require conversions or trailers to suit their purpose. As such these farm trucks come with custom ordered equipment or specifications."
 IND_motorized_equipment_4_desc:0 "An exceptionally strong 6x6 5-ton heavy-duty offroad truck built for industrial purposes with custom modifications and built to order off the civilian market. Capable of carrying up to 12 soldiers and hauling just as much weight as military utility trucks, the 6x6 civilian market industrial trucks perfectly suit the military's needs. These trucks often share most of the same elements as military-grade vehicles and sometimes are the same designs."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:0 "A simple but elegant early market helicopter. Helicopters have numerous uses in industry, public services, emergency services, commerce, and sometimes personal usage. Civilian market helicopters rarely live up to the specifications of military-grade helicopters and will not be anywhere near as capable."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "A commercial helicopter purchased on the civilian market. These helicopters are intended for a variety of civilian purposes including emergency or public services and commerce. These helicopters can be fitted for a variety of military roles by custom order or by retrofitting by military professionals."
 IND_utility_helicopter_equipment_5_desc:0 "An exceptionally strong and capable heavy-duty helicopter built for emergency services and industrial use. These helicopters are fast, strong, and somewhat comparable to military-grade helicopters in the era they are available for purchase. They can be fitted to serve virtually any role a military utility helicopter can and serve a direct combat or support role. Additionally, with minor custom specifications they can even be equipped with countermeasures or weapons you produce or purchase from military contracts."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_3_desc:0 "A mixture of numerous different surplus transport planes left over from WW2 and sold by a large variety of independent surplus traders. Many nations after WW2 had surplus equipment they no longer desired to kept or wanted to replace with more modern planes after the war. As such, these surplus WW2 transport planes come in varying states of repair, mileage, and design. But you can't put a price on antiquity."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_5_desc:0 "After the creation of efficient air freight in 1950s, commercial and industrial uses for cargo planes skyrocketed. These commercial cargo planes are more than capable of efficiently transporting cargo or serving military purposes. Commercial cargo planes need minimal refitting for military purposes unless they are used for airborne operations in which case their design would need to be altered heavily to fit that role. However, they often have no trouble in most situations."
 IND_transport_plane_equipment_8_desc:0 "Comprising numerous different categories of cargo jets, these commercial cargo jets can be anything from combi planes to belly cargo planes or even comprise international postal service cargo planes. These cargo jets are often used to transport cargo that needs to be delivered quickly and cannot arrive on a freighter's time. These jets are often capable of serving military roles but it is heavily recommended that you custom order them for airborne operations in combat zones."
 IND_cargo_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "A prototype/early-adoption civilian market cargo helicopter. While the civilian world had countless uses for utility helicopters, making heavy-duty cargo helicopters for commercial or military purposes took some time. There were plenty of early adopters for cargo helicopters and large numbers of independent manufacturers that could take cargo helicopter contracts and orders."
 IND_cargo_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "A fully capable industrial/commercial civilian market cargo helicopter. These helicopters are capable of filling numerous roles in industry or commerce and are used extensively in emergency services. Besides emergency services and some divisions in industry and commerce, they are often a luxury or novelty as smaller utility helicopters fill the same roles just as fine for civilian needs. However, it isn't hard to find civilian industrial manufacturers that are able to and willing to produce these."

Civilian merchant vessels can serve in military logistics perfectly and are ubiquitously available with countless manufacturers and drydocks readily available to mass manufacture these ships. Cargo freighters handle the bulk of international trade in the world and are divided into classes based on the type of cargo they carry. They can be general cargo vessels, container ships, tankers, dry bulk carriers, multi-purpose vessels, RORO ships (for wheeled vehicles), or reefer ships (refrigerated)."
