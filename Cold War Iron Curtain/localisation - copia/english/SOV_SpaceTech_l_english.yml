 SOV_woodmetal_frames_short:0 "R-1"
 SOV_woodmetal_frames_desc:0 "The R-1 rocket (NATO reporting name SS-1 Scunner, Soviet code name SA11, GRAU index 8A11) was a tactical ballistic missile manufactured in the Soviet Union based on the German V-2 rocket. Even though it was a copy, it was manufactured using Soviet industrial plants and gave the Soviets valuable experience which later enabled the USSR to construct its own much more capable rockets. The R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950."
 
 SOV_pressure_vessel1:0 "R-5 Pobeda"
 SOV_pressure_vessel1_short:0 "R-5 Pobeda"
 SOV_pressure_vessel1_desc:0 "The R-5 Pobeda ("Victory") was a theatre ballistic missile developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The R-5M version was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-3 Shyster and carried the GRAU index 8K51. The R-5 was originally a development of OKB-1 as a single-stage missile with a detachable warhead reentry vehicle. The R-5M was a nuclear armed missile – the first nuclear missile to be deployed by the Soviet Union – with greater payload and weight but better reliability than its predecessor. The R-5M gave the Soviet Union the ability to target many strategic targets in Europe. The R-5M entered service on 21 May 1956 (retired in 1967), and in 1959 was installed at Vogelsang, Zehdenick and Fürstenberg/Havel in East Germany - the first Soviet nuclear missile bases outside the USSR."
 
 
 SOV_pressure_vessel2:0 "Vostok"
 SOV_pressure_vessel2_short:0 "Vostok"
 SOV_pressure_vessel2_desc:0 "Vostok (Russian: Восток, translated as "East") was a family of rockets derived from the Soviet R-7 Semyorka ICBM and was designed for the human spaceflight programme. This family of rockets launched the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) and the first crewed spacecraft (Vostok) in human history. It was a subset of the R-7 family of rockets. On March 18, 1980 a Vostok-2M rocket exploded on its launch pad at Plesetsk during a fueling operation, killing 48 people. An investigation into a similar – but avoided – accident revealed that the substitution of lead-based for tin-based solder in hydrogen peroxide filters allowed the breakdown of the H2O2, thus causing the resultant explosion."
 
 SOV_pressure_vessel3:0 "N1/L3"
 SOV_pressure_vessel3_short:0 "N1/L3"
 SOV_pressure_vessel3_desc:0 "The N1/L3 (Raketa-nositel', "Carrier Rocket"; Cyrillic: Н1) was a super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to deliver payloads beyond low Earth orbit. The N1 was the Soviet counterpart to the US Saturn V and was intended to enable crewed travel to Earth's Moon and beyond, with studies beginning as early as 1959. Its first stage remains the most powerful rocket stage ever built, but all of the four flown N1 Block A first stages failed because a lack of static test firings meant that plumbing issues and other adverse characteristics with the large cluster of thirty engines and its complex fuel and oxidizer feeder system were not revealed earlier."
 
 
 SOV_pressure_vessel4:0 "Energia"
 SOV_pressure_vessel4_short:0 "Energia"
 SOV_pressure_vessel4_desc:0 "Energia (GRAU 11K25) was a super-heavy lift launch vehicle. It was designed by NPO Energia of the Soviet Union for a variety of payloads including the Buran spacecraft. Control system main developer enterprise was the Khartron NPO "Electropribor". The Energia used four strap-on boosters each powered by a four-chamber RD-170 engine burning kerosene/LOX, and a central core stage with four single-chamber RD-0120 (11D122) engines fueled by liquid hydrogen/LOX. The launch vehicle had two functionally different operational variants: Energia-Polyus, the initial test configuration, in which the Polyus system was used as a final stage to put the payload into orbit, and Energia-Buran, in which the Buran-class orbiters were the payload and the source of the orbit insertion impulse.The launch vehicle had the capacity to place about 100 tonnes in Low Earth orbit, up to 20 tonnes to geostationary orbit and up to 32 tonnes by translunar trajectory into lunar orbit. The launch vehicle made just two flights to orbit before being discontinued. Since 2016, there have been attempts to revive the launch vehicle."

 SOV_pressure_vessel5_desc:0 ""Angara-A5" - Russian heavy-class launch vehicle of the "Angara" family. Environmentally friendly rocket fuel (oxygen + kerosene) [86] allows to reduce the environmental load from launches on the environment. It is launched with five universal rocket modules URM-1, which are equipped with RD-191 engines (four modules in the first stage and one in the second)."

 SOV_pressure_vessel6_short:0 "Yenisei"
 SOV_pressure_vessel6_desc:0 "Yenisei, project name RN STK-1 (Raketa-Nositel' SverkhTyazhologo Klassa - Launch vehicle super-heavy class), is the first super-heavy launch vehicle being developed by the Russian space industry. The main developer is RSC Energia. It is being developed within the framework of the federal target program "Creation of a super-heavy class space rocket complex for 2020-2030" and the program cost is estimated at 1.5 trillion roubles. It is the main rocket of the Russian Lunar program. The final design for the rocket is expected to be complete by autumn 2021. The first launch is expected to happen in 2028 from the Vostochny cosmodrome. Based on the Yenisei launch vehicle, the Don launch vehicle (RN STK-2) is being developed by adding another stage."
 

# Propulsion
 SOV_liquid_propellant:0 "NK-9 (8D517)"
 SOV_liquid_propellant_short:0 "NK-9 (8D517)"
 SOV_liquid_propellant_desc:0 "NK-9 (8D517) is a liquid-propellant rocket engine developed by the SNTK im. ND Kuznetsova. Since May 1959, the development of liquid-propellant rocket engines began. One of the first rocket engines developed was the NK-9 engine. NK-9 was intended for the first stage of the GR-1 "Global-1" intercontinental missile (SS-10 according to NATO classification). It was the world's first oxygen-kerosene engine in the thrust class over 1 MN, made in a closed circuit with generator gas afterburning in the combustion chamber. For the second stage of this rocket, the NK-9V engine was developed. Its trials began in September 1962. In the early 1960s, on the basis of the NK-9, the NK-19 and NK-21 LPREs were created for the third and fourth stages of the N1 launch vehicle."
 

 SOV_nuclear_pulse_propulsion:0 "RD-0410"
 SOV_nuclear_pulse_propulsion_short:0 "RD-0410"
 SOV_nuclear_pulse_propulsion_desc:0 "RD-0410 was a Soviet nuclear thermal rocket engine. The engine was ground-tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and its use was incorporated in the Kurchatov Mars 1994 crewed mission proposal. This engine had slightly higher performance (exhaust temperature and specific impulse) over NERVA (the U.S. nuclear thermal rocket engine project). The design of the reactor core included thermal insulation between uranium carbide/tungsten carbide fuel and the zirconium hydride moderator. This solution allowed for a very compact reactor core design. Hydrogen flow cooled the moderator first allowing to keep very low neutron energy and high fission cross-section, then it was heated by the direct contact to the fuel rods. To prevent the chemical reaction between carbide and hydrogen, about 1 percent of heptane was added to the hydrogen after the moderator passage."
