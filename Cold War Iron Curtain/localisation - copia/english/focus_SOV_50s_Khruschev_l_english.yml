 Tblisi.1.d:0 "Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinization would begin to tear down the cult of personality formed around the totalitarian during his lifetime, but not all would approve. Many have come to see Stalin as a national hero who bravely led the Communist world against the evils of the Axis powers and the Imperial oppressors. Stalin remains especially popular in his home region of Georgia, where Khrushchev has grown increasingly unpopular due to his anti-Stalin reforms. Khrushchev's closed door speech to the 20th Congress which rallied against Stalin and his Georgian loyalists would only further cause frustration. In retaliation, on March 4th, Georgians would gather around a monument of Stalin to mourn the third anniversary of his death. Within the coming days, an organized protest movement against Khrushchev would begin to gain major traction as thousands of people took to the street. Quickly, the situation has devolved with many Georgian nationalists calling for the secession of Georgia from the Soviet Union entirely. Georgian local authorities are entirely blindsided and wait for instructions from Moscow. " 							#The Tbilisi Riot (over removal of Stalin monument)
 destalinization.3.d:0 "After nearly 6 days of paralyzing riots in the Georgian SSR, Moscow has finally reasserted full control over her region. Following an intense standoff against local police forces, the military was sent in to disperse the crowds.  The situation would meet its head when a civilian delegation would be arrested by the government and the protesters would storm the military and police to rescue them. Soviet tanks would storm into Lenin Square Follower by troop battalions which would have no qualms in gunning the crowd down with live ammunition. By the 10th of March, protesters were arrested and killed in mass with hundreds others disappearing within the middle of the night. Order has been restored but the legitimacy of Khrushchev and his leadership are now questionable." 					#Restore Public Order (Aftermath of Tbilisi Riot)
 malenkov_resign.1.d:0 "Following the death of Lavrentiy Beria, pressure would quickly amount on Premier George Malenkov to step down. Khrushchev and the rest of the Politburo were quick to denounce Malenkov for his close connection to Beria and his willingness to betray others for political gain. Without much of a choice in the matter, he would announce his resignation in February of 1955. Following this, he would return as a regular member on the Politburo disgruntled. With this, new leadership of the Soviet Union can finally begin." 					#Malenkov Resignation

 Beria_Arriest.1.d:0 "Head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria, once seemed to be in a position to take the reigns of the Soviet Union following the death of Stalin. However, his scheming would fall short as his rivals were one step ahead. During a meeting with his close advisors, military forces would circumvent the NKVD and arrest Beria and his collaborators. Quickly after, a makeshift trial absent of a defense counsel would find Beria guilty of treasonous actions in coordination with London and terrorism against the state. Beria and six of his cohorts were quickly put to a firing squad with their remains burned. With one of the darkest figures of the Stalin era put to rest, what awaits the future of the Soviet Union remains undecided as many figures still hold great sway over the Politburo."

 KHRUSCHEV_Reveal_the_Factitious_Doctors_Plot_desc:0 "The Doctors Plot was a bunch of corn cooked up by a paranoid old Stalin near his deathbed in a fever dream. As a result, all of Moscow's prominent Doctors- most of them Jewish, all of them innocent- have been executed. This is a bad look for the government and Moscow has no doctors. We need to tell the public we had no part in this affair."

 KHRUSCHEV_Gain_the_Backing_of_the_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army is very influential in modern Soviet politics, as indicated by Marshal Zhukov's great aid in our rise to power. However, we need to gain the rest of the Army's support if we are to truly be secure."

 KHRUSCHEV_Loosen_Freedom_of_Speach_Restrictions_desc:0 "For decades, free speech has been largely but a dream for many of our citizens, as the NKVD and now the KGB have been cracking down on any sign of political dissent. However, perhaps it is time to relax restrictions."

 KHRUSCHEV_Promote_Limited_Cultural_Liberalization_desc:0 "We have tried throughout the years to create and maintain one Soviet Socialist culture and way of thought, but diverse as our Union is, some regions haven't taken so well to it.

 KHRUSCHEV_Counter_the_Anti_Party_Group_desc:0 "The Anti-Party Group is, true to their name, a group that opposes and condemns the dominance of Nikita Khrushchev in the CPSU. Spearheaded by Malenkov, Foreign Minister Dmitry Shepilov and Ranking official Lazar Kaganovich, they recently have been planning to oust our beloved leader from power. Thankfully, we have caught word of this plot and can pre-empt their attempt."

 KHRUSCHEV_Ensure_Khrushchevs_Socialism_Existence_desc:0 "It is now quite evident for all to see that not only is Nikita Khrushchev here to stay, but he is also a true Socialist and a fitting leader of our great Union. He will surely have a good grip on the helm of the USSR for years to come."

 KHRUSCHEV_Crackdown_on_the_Russian_Orthodox_Church_desc:0 "The Russian Orthodox Church has been a thorn in our side for years, promoting the opiate of the masses and indoctrinating our people. It is time they learned their place."
 KHRUSCHEV_Exile_Clergymen:0 "Exile Clergymen"
 KHRUSCHEV_Exile_Clergymen_desc:0 "Certain upstart Priests have refused to de-escalate their religious rhetoric, so we will be forced to escalate our responses. A stay in Siberia should do wonders for them."

 KHRUSCHEV_Open_Psychiatric_Asylums_for_Opponents_desc:0 "A convenient way of disappearing religious and political opponents is to have a state-ordained and employed psychiatrist mark them is clinically insane and ship them off to an asylum."
 KHRUSCHEV_End_Cultural_Indulgences:0 "End Cultural Indulgences"
 KHRUSCHEV_End_Cultural_Indulgences_desc:0 "Our trial of renewed cultural liberalization has failed. Our people have taken our gracious gift and used it to defame our government, slander our nation, and embarrass our Premier. If they will not use our gift wisely, they will not have it anymore."

 KHRUSCHEV_Appoint_Molotov_Ambassador_of_Mongolia_desc:0 "Molotov is no longer head of the government, but he is still dangerous. We cannot just execute or exile him, as he is too popular, but an enterprising official has suggested the following- make him ambassador to Mongolia. In effect, it is exile, as he will have to live in that far away steppe for most of the rest of his days."

 KHRUSCHEV_Exile_Kaganovitch_and_Shepilov_Beyond_the_Urals_desc:0 "Kaganovich and Shepilov deserve worse than exile for their role in the failed Anti Party Group coup, but exile is what they shall receive. We hope that they enjoy the trip to Siberia!"

 KHRUSCHEV_Limit_Public_Officials_Terms_desc:0 "Too many old guard, narrow minded party officials are hanging on to their positions and dragging down our efforts to improve the Union and party with them.

 KHRUSCHEV_Prepare_a_New_Generation_of_Cadres_desc:0 "Now that we have begun removing old officials, we need new and energetic party members to replace them. Thankfully, our eager Komsomolets are more than ready to take up the mantle of public service to the Union."

 KHRUSCHEV_Supply_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam_desc:0 "The North Vietnamese have been battling for their survival against the old world imperialist West for a long time, and despite their technological disadvantage have performed spectacularly.

 KHRUSCHEV_Expand_Indochinese_Guerilla_Operations_desc:0 "The Vietcong and Khmer Rouge are already mounting successful guerilla warfare campaigns against the Capitalists, but that doesn't mean they don't need any help. Soviet arms and advisors would aid them greatly in their quest for freedom."

 KHRUSCHEV_Reach_Out_to_Thai_Communist_desc:0 "Though Thailand is helping the West fight the oppressed Vietcong and other freedom fighters in Indochina, it has a large amount of Communist supporters itself. Perhaps that is something we can use to our advantage."

 KHRUSCHEV_Cut_Ties_with_Mao:0 "Cut Ties with Mao"
 KHRUSCHEV_Cut_Ties_with_Mao_desc:0 "Diametrically opposed to Tito is Mao. He is greedy, power hungry, aggressive, and poses a threat to our security in the East. Unfortunately, we and the Chinese will be going our own ways now."

 KHRUSCHEV_Form_the_Warsaw_Pact_desc:0 "The COMINFORM/COMINTERN political and military alliance structure is outdated and antiquated, especially when compared to the high organization of NATO.
