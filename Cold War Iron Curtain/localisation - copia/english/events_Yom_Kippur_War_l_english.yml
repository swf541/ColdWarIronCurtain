 EGY_1973.1.t:0 "Egypt Launches Operation Badr"
 EGY_1973.1.d:0 "After months of preparation, our armed forces are ready to launch Operation Badr. Operation Badr will allow our forces to breakthrough Zionist formations and penetrate the Sinai. The mistakes of previous conflicts will not be repeated. This time the war will be on our terms and we are prepared to drive through the enemy. The Zionists have grown complacent and many of their forces are on leave for Yom Kippur.  We are attacking in Ramadan, a most auspicious month which will only strengthen the belief of our soldiers on the front."
 EGY_1973.1.a:0 "So it begins..."

 EGY_1973.2.t:0 "The Sinai is Ours!" 
 EGY_1973.2.d:0 "The Zionists have long proclaimed the Sinai as an unbreakable fortress but today our forces have not only breached their walls but now control the Sinai. Sinai is an arm of the Egyptian nation and its return to our just control inspires the nation. Millions across Egypt welcome the news and the morale of our forces on the front is overflowing. The decision facing our government and military is whether to offer a cease fire or press on. Since we have secured the Sinai, sovereign Egyptian land, we can fortify our positions and offer a ceasefire from a position of strength. However, doing so will risk alienating our Arab brothers who will want us to push on toward Jerusalem. Considering how well our forces are driving the enemy back, pressing on to end the Zionist threat once and for all is also an option. Achieving total victory would allow us to determine the future of the region but the resistance can be expected to intensify, and we risk wearing down our own forces." 
 EGY_1973.2.a:0 "Offer a ceasefire"
 EGY_1973.2.b:0 "Let us complete our conquest!"

 EGY_1973.3.t:0 "More Gains in Palestine!"
 EGY_1973.3.d:0 "From the Sinai, our troops have continued to press on into the Zionist territory, liberating swaths of Arab lands in Palestine. The Zionists continue to resist our forces, but our commanders have quietly expressed their own surprise at the success of our forces. However, as the military advances, it is moving further away from supply lines and there is a worry of over-extension from senior commanders. It must now be decided whether we declare a ceasefire and negotiate with the Sinai and key parts of Palestine under our control, or if we should continue to press for a final victory. Certainly, a ceasefire now would give us a great negotiating position. However, total victory would allow us to dictate the terms, but pushing on may entail more international pressure and risk our forces to a Zionist counter-attack."
 EGY_1973.3.a:0 "Offer a ceasefire" 
 EGY_1973.3.b:0 "Let us complete our conquest!"

 EGY_1973.4.t:0 "Ultimatum from the United States"
 EGY_1973.4.d:0 "The Americans revealed themselves to be the Zionist stooges we always knew them to be. As our forces continue to pummel the Zionists and liberate more Palestinian land, we received a note from the United States. They have demanded we offer a ceasefire to the Zionists or they will intervene. Considering the Americans power and influence, such a threat cannot be taken lightly. We have already achieved so much and offering a ceasefire will be done from a position of strength. Perhaps now is the time to stop and celebrate our amazing achievements over the enemy. However, a number of senior officials point out this may all just be a bluff as the American government may not be able to rally its people to support a war which risks widening into a confrontation with the Soviet Union. Especially if it is over the fate of a foreign state."
 EGY_1973.4.a:0 "Offer a ceasefire" 
 EGY_1973.4.b:0 "Ignore"

 EGY_1973.5.t:0 "The United States Intervenes"
 EGY_1973.5.d:0 "Cairo has been in a state of shock since news reached that the United States has joined the Zionists and will be deploying its military against our brave men. We had underestimated how deep the Zionists influence over the United States and thought they would not risk global peace for the sake of a foreign state. We plan on holding immediate talks with the Soviet ambassador to see if they can help. Despite this diplomatic setback, the success of our forces on the ground and the morale of our people will ensure we will be ready to face whatever challenges the Americans throw our way in their doomed effort to save the Zionists."
 EGY_1973.5.a:0  "So they were not bluffing..."

 EGY_1973.6.t:0 "The Zionists Accept our Terms!"
 EGY_1973.6.d:0 "Operation Badr saw our brave forces breach the Zionist fortifications in Sinai, defenses they had proclaimed impenetrable. Once we broke through, our men were able to pressure the enemy and drive them out of the Sinai. Securing the Sinai has returned the sacred land back to the motherland. Our position of strength secured, we graciously offered the Zionists a ceasefire with the Sinai under our control. The cowardly enemy accepted our terms and now our troops are the masters of the Sinai. Thousands have taken to the street across Egypt to celebrate our stunning success over the Zionists. However, other Arab states have criticized us for halting, but that does not matter, we have restored Egyptian honor and delivered a crushing blow to the Zionists."
 EGY_1973.6.a:0 "Victory!"

 EGY_1973.7.t:0 "The Zionists Accept our Terms!"
 EGY_1973.7.d:0 "The war began with Operation Badr in the Sinai. Its stunning success saw us drive off the Zionists from and liberate that sacred Egyptian land. Our forces then pushed on and in a series of victories have liberated a large portion of western and southern Palestine. With these lands secured, we offered the Zionists a ceasefire and the cowards accepted. Egypt now controls the Sinai and our brave armed forces will remain in Palestine to protect its people and oversee the removal of any Zionist presence within that land. Across the Arab world, hundreds of thousands have taken to the street to celebrate the victory of Arab arms and the liberation of Arab lands from years of occupation."
 EGY_1973.7.a:0 "Victory!"

 EGY_1973.8.t:0 "The Zionists Refuse Ceasefire"
 EGY_1973.8.d:0 "Our forces have been routing the Zionists since the conflict began. They suffer defeat after defeat against our brave forces. We graciously offered them terms for a ceasefire and only ask that they accept our forces will remain in the land they have currently liberated. Yet despite our generosity, the Zionists instead rejected our terms. Their foolishness and delusions are their own fault and now our forces will have no choice but to keep on moving forward against the enemy."
 EGY_1973.8.a:0 "So they choose death..."

 EGY_1973.9.t:0 "The Zionists Offer Ceasefire"
 EGY_1973.9.d:0 "Our brave forces continue to battle the Zionist foe. Where we advance, they fall back and where they attack us, we bleed them down. The Zionists remain stunned at the tenacity, genius, and fighting prowess of our armed forces. As a result, they have offered us a ceasefire that would see both sides return to prewar borders. Of course, our men are doing exceptionally well in the field, but the commanders have noted the advance has been slow. We have proven ourselves as fighting men and perhaps a ceasefire will allow us to negotiate from a much stronger position now. However, although the advance has been slow, it may just be a matter of time before we breakthrough and turn the tide completely, why else would they offer a ceasefire?"
 EGY_1973.9.a:0 "Accept ceasefire"

 EGY_1973.10.t:0 "The Zionists' Second Ceasefire Offer"
 EGY_1973.10.d:0 "The Zionists once again have offered a ceasefire to end the hostilities. Our brave men have stiffened their opposition and although we have lost key territories, the defense of Cairo remains strong. Among the senior officials, some argue accepting a ceasefire at this stage may reduce the harshness of the Zionist demands. However, another group argues negotiating or groveling to the enemy would be a disgrace to our great Arab nation. The choice is now to either accept the Zionist ceasefire or fight on to the last man, or, with the help of God, we may even change our fortunes."
 EGY_1973.10.a:0 "Accept ceasefire" 
 EGY_1973.10.b:0 "We will fight to the last!"

 EGY_1973.11.t:0 "The Soviet Union Intervenes"
 EGY_1973.11.d:0 "The Soviet Union has long been a friend to the people of Egypt and in our greatest struggle, they have come to our aid. The Soviet support will bolster our brave armed forces and raise the morale of our people. The Soviets had prepared a number of specialized troops for rapid deployment and we can expect them to start arriving soon. The Zionists and their gang of supporters will have to now deal with the Red Army and our forces."
 EGY_1973.11.a:0 "We were not expecting special forces."

 ISR_1973.1.d:0 "From forward positions in the Sinai and other intelligence assets, we have received multiple reports that the Egyptians have begun mobilizing their forces. The massing of Arab troops and equipment to our border is of concern. Some in the cabinet feel the mobilization may just be posturing to placate the domestic population and warn an escalation by our forces could turn international opinion completely against us. Others however, advocate we cancel the Yom Kippur leave many of our personnel are enjoying and deploy them to the front immediately. They advocate we cannot give the initiative to the enemy."

 ISR_1973.3.d:0 "Our brave warriors in the IDF continue to resist the Arab aggression in the Sinai. Despite our best efforts however, the troops have been forced out of the Sinai and are now positioned to defend the homeland from aggression. The Egyptians, no doubt aware their treacherous attack no longer has the surprise it did have offered us a ceasefire that accepts their occupation of Sinai. If we accept the ceasefire now, we will still have our land intact and can focus on other threats and regrouping from the initial losses. However, some IDF leaders suggest the Egyptians have spent all their tricks and soon we will be able to strike back and drive them over the canal."

Against overwhelming Arab aggression, the IDF continues to fight and bleed the enemy for every inch of our sacred soil they take. This is why the Egyptians have recently sent a ceasefire offer to us. Accepting it will mean allowing Arab armies to occupy Sinai, Gaza, and southern Israel. Although we would be losing our land, at the very least it will buy us time to regroup and ensure the survival of the rest of Israel. However, some senior officials suggest we fight on, trust in our faith and people. To be at the mercy of our enemy would be a worse fate than death."

 ISR_1973.5.d:0 "In what many in Israel liken to a biblical miracle, the United States has agreed to intervene and save Israel from the Arab aggression threatening to destroy the nation. The United States announcement has come as our IDF continues to resist from its last bastions of defense. The arrival of American support will no doubt turn the tide and already specialist forces are said to be in route to the region. Our intelligence reports the mood in Cairo has changed from jubilation to abject horror."

Although the Arabs cowardly attacked us without warning, the IDF has successfully beaten them back and our forces are deep in Egypt, ensuring they will never think to harm our people again. Many senior cabinet members suggest the message to Egypt has been sent at this point and to offer the ceasefire, however, there are also several cabinet and IDF officers who believe the Soviets are simply bluffing. They suggest the Soviets are only placating the Egyptians and would not seriously consider intervening directly."

 ISR_1973.7.t:0 "Soviet Union Intervenes..."

The satisfaction and pride we had felt earlier for our soldiers who have taken the war deep into an enemy which had so treacherously attacked us has now turned into a fear for them and our own survival.  The government had failed to read the Soviet intentions and now must suffer the consequences, however, despite this setback we will persevere."

The Egyptians thought they could launch a cowardly attack without our knowledge and destroy our presence in the Sinai. However, the IDF proved to be the superior force and our stubborn resistance and counter-attacks have ensured our victory and dominance in the Sinai. Some suggest this is the time to offer a ceasefire and end hostilities as we remain in control and have defeated the attack. Others however, believe the Arabs must be taught a lesson and the IDF should press on. An overwhelming victory could provide us decades of security."

International mediators suggest the Egyptians have had enough and are likely to accept a ceasefire. With victory assured, it makes sense to offer a ceasefire at this stage and end the fighting. This will allow us to regroup, negotiate from a position of strength, and improve our standing internationally. However, there are some senior officials and IDF officers who are suggesting we push forward and march on till the Arabs have nowhere else to retreat."

The treacherous Egyptian attempt has been thwarted and they have accepted our generous offer of a ceasefire. The IDF fought tenaciously and with steely determination to keep the Sinai under our control. The Sinai remains a bastion of Israeli defense and with this success we hope the Egyptians will now see they have no chance to change the status quo through the force of arms.

Their treacherous attempt to seize the Sinai through military force was not just thwarted by the IDF but we turned it into an advance into Egypt. We not only stopped them from taking the Sinai, but our brave forces took the fight into Egypt and captured the vital Suez from the enemy.

 SYR_1973.1.d:0 "For months we have been preparing to strike against the enemy with our brothers in Egypt. Now that they have launched a devastating strike against the Zionists, the time has come for us to join in. The Zionists have no idea about our preparations and underestimate us. We will avenge past humiliations and restore not only Arab pride but also our occupied lands. The men are motivated by their just cause and eagerly await the call to move forward."

 SYR_1973.2.d:0 "Our preparations and rearming has paid off for the Syrian Arab Army. We now control the Golan, restoring Syrian rule to land taken unjustly from us. The Zionist forces were inadequate to the task of withstanding our superior forces. Now that we have retaken our land, there are some calls from senior officials and military leaders that it might be time to offer a ceasefire. With the Golan secure we can easily negotiate it back and end the war before the Zionists can regain their footing. Another faction however, argue we must press on and liberate more Arab lands especially with the enemy so weak."

The enemy force continues to be beaten down by our military might. Once again, some of our top leaders are suggesting we offer a ceasefire to the Zionists. They state we have achieved a stunning victory and now is the time to end the fighting on our terms. At the same time others in the leadership are urging we continue the fight.

However, the Zionists had one more trick up their sleeve as their agents have convinced the United States to issue an ultimatum demanding we offer a ceasefire and end the war now. Considering we have already thoroughly battered the enemy and achieved our objectives, it may be time to issue the ceasefire and avoid this American threat.

Panic has taken the streets as citizens have begun preparing for American bombers to arrive by staying off the streets and stockpiling supplies. Government and military installations are being fortified as senior government officials and officers struggle to comprehend that the United States has joined the war against our nation. We had thought their ultimatum was just a ploy and did not think they would seriously join the conflict.

 SYR_1973.9.d:0 "The Zionists recently offered a ceasefire to end the fighting between us. Our brave military has fought with tenacity and dedication against an enemy bolstered with foreign help. Despite the odds stacked against our forces, we continue to battle them as equals and the success of our fighters has no doubt pushed the Zionists to offer a ceasefire with an agreement to return to prewar borders. Some of the leadership suggests we have proven ourselves and a ceasefire would be wise. Others are urging we reject the Zionist offer and press on. They say the enemy is obviously on the verge of collapse against us and is trying to end the fighting before we turn the tide."

In a reflection of the pain we are inflicting on our advancing foe, we received a ceasefire offer from the enemy. They no doubt are not willing to lose more lives in the effort to dislodge us. Although we have lost lands, some in the leadership believe accepting a ceasefire now will be to our advantage as we have shown the people our devotion to the cause. However, another faction says we should never negotiate with the enemy and if this is the end, we must fight to the last man and trust God will turn the tide for us."

 SYR_1973.11.d:0 "A palpable mood of optimism and even joy permeates across Syria today. Our people received word that the Soviet Union has decided to intervene and prevent the Zionists from destroying the region for their selfish goals. The Soviet Union recognizes the evil agenda of our enemy and are prepared to help us in anyway. Already our officials are on the phone or arranging meetings with their Soviet counterparts. As the Soviets were keeping a close watch with regards to the war, we expect their support to come soon."

 USA_1973.1.t:0 "Egypt Retakes Sinai"
 USA_1973.1.d:0 "The National Security Council was informed that the Egyptian armed forces have successfully taken the Sinai from Israeli forces. This news has come as a shock to our analysts and military leaders who had all been under the impression that the Israelis would easily be able to withstand an Egyptian assault. However, analysts attribute this Egyptian success to the surprise of their attack and are still insisting that once the Israeli forces regroup, they will be able to hold off the Egyptians from further advance and may even push back to the Sinai. However, considering how wrong they were earlier we might just have to keep close tabs on how the situation on the ground evolves."
 USA_1973.1.a:0 "We will monitor this closely."

 USA_1973.2.t:0 "Egypt Advances Further"
 USA_1973.2.d:0 "Publicly, the Israeli government insists the situation is well under its control but our intelligence agencies and the media have increasingly pointed to the continued advance of Egyptian forces deeper into Israel proper. Recently, the Israeli ambassador urged us to become more involved and said he feared a total Egyptian victory would result in a humanitarian crisis and mass deportations in numbers not seen since World War II. Some in the National Security Council concur and have suggested we give the Egyptians an ultimatum to end the fighting and offer a ceasefire or risk our intervention. A complete Israeli defeat would catastrophically destroy our foreign policy in the region and many Americans support Israel. However, other senior officials believe we should not involve ourselves in the conflict and risk committing troops to a foreign war."

 USA_1973.3.t:0 "Egypt Ignored our Ultimatum"
 USA_1973.3.d:0 "The Egyptian government ignored our ultimatum that it must offer a ceasefire and end the fighting with Israel. They have achieved their objectives and are now pushing to destroy the state of Israel. This has greatly angered many Americans. We have assets ready to deploy and stop the Egyptians but some in the cabinet are now saying despite the ultimatum, we should still not intervene. They argue prolonging the conflict and involving American forces will only complicate matters. However, other cabinet and military leaders say our government made a promise and we must honor it by intervening against the Egyptian aggression."

 USA_1973.4.t:0 "Syria takes the Golan"
 USA_1973.4.d:0 "The Golan Heights have long been desired by the Syrians after they lost control of it to the Israelis. However, during the ongoing war in the region, Syrian forces have driven the Israelis out of the Golan and are now in control of it. This has caught our senior intelligence and regional experts completely off-guard as most assessments believed the Israelis would easily hold off a Syrian attempt. As the Israeli forces regroup from this setback, they may turn the tide of the fighting, but the Syrians just as easily may continue their success into northern Israel, we will have to keep a close eye on how the fighting develops from here on."
 USA_1973.4.a:0 "We will monitor this closely"

 USA_1973.5.t:0 "Syria Advances Further"
 USA_1973.5.d:0 "Following their success in the Golan, the National Security Council was informed today that Syrian forces are now deep into northern Israel. The Israeli resistance appears to be faltering and the Israeli ambassador privately stated his fears that the Syrians may very well destroy the state of Israel. The National Security Council noted this potential scenario and debated whether an ultimatum should be sent to the Syrians demanding they end the fighting and offer a ceasefire or face an American intervention. Many believe the threat alone should be enough to end the fighting. However, others at the meeting stated although losing Israel will destroy American foreign policy in the region, it maybe best to not involve ourselves in the fighting."

Forces are ready to move in and many at the meeting are urging that America must honor its word and teach Syria a lesson. At this stage Syria has achieved its objectives and now they are waging a war of destruction. Others at the meeting point out the Syrians have called our bluff and our tactic to force a peace has failed, they say this does not mean American needs to intervene."

Israel remains in control of the Sinai much to the frustration of the Egyptians. The Egyptians are utilizing our equipment and expertise, we will continue to offer them support but now we can only observe. The Egyptians insist their forces are fighting the Israelis to a standstill at the moment but the situation could change as the fighting continues."

 SOV_1973.2.d:0 "A meeting of senior military, intelligence, and political leaders was informed that Israeli forces are pushing into Egypt from the Sinai despite Egyptian resistance. The Israelis continued advance can only be seen as an attempt to inflict an excessive punitive punishment on the people of Egypt. An Israeli occupation of the Suez may threaten our economic interests as well. It was decided to debate whether we should tell the Israelis they must end the fighting and offer a ceasefire or risk a Soviet intervention. It was felt the threat of our involvement will compel them to stop the war. However, others argued we should not even give such an ultimatum and we should let the conflict conclude on its own as the Soviet people are not interested in fighting a foreign war."

 SOV_1973.3.d:0 "An overly confident Israeli government has arrogantly refused to accept our ultimatum. For many this decision has confirmed their assessment that Israel seeks to deliver a punitive punishment on the Egyptians. For the sake of the Egyptian people and our economy we must now act. The Israelis may decide to destroy the Suez or worse block it from our traffic to punish us in the future so we must intervene now to protect Egypt and our interests. However, there are those who feel that the ultimatum was meant to force a peace not a serious threat and since the Israelis called the bluff, it would be best to just let the war continue to its natural conclusion."

The effort has not been a success as the Israeli forces remain in control of the Golan. The Syrian military insists the fighting has stalemated and they will soon breakthrough but there is a fear the Israeli forces may soon move into Syria itself. Our intelligence and diplomatic assets continue to observe and will keep us updated on any changes to the situation."

 SOV_1973.5.d:0 "The Israeli military pushes deeper into Syria, pushing the Syrian military back. Although the Syrians are still insisting it still has control of the situation, it is clear the Israelis are pushing onwards. The Syrian ambassador has privately told us of his fears regarding Israeli intentions for his country. Our own analysts fear the Israelis are seeking to expand into Syria and cause a humanitarian crisis in the region that has not been seen since the emergence of Israel. The senior politburo is debating whether we should or should not send Israel an ultimatum to end the fighting or risk our armed intervention."

Many of the senior military and political leaders are arguing the Israeli refusal indicates our fears that they will implement a disastrous and negative transformation to the region. They also believe our forces will easily resolve the conflict and teach a lesson to Israel. Others, however, argue the point of the ultimatum was to force a peace and that has not been achieved. Instead of involving ourselves in a risky foreign war we should just wait to see how this ends."

The Arab states are far more prepared for military conflict than in the past and the Israelis refusal to compromise indicates an overconfidence. Further delay will allow the Israelis to further entrench themselves. If the Arab states let this moment past, they may not get another chance."
