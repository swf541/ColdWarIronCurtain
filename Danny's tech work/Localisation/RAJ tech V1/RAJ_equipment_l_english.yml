The ZSU-23-4 has a very high density, rate and accuracy of fire, as well as the capability for each of the four autocannons to fire its own type of projectile from separate belts. While it is technically possible that each cannon shoots different type of ammunition, there were two types commonly used in late 1970s, OFZT incendiary fragmentation and BZT armour-piercing tracer, which were to be loaded in 3:1 ratio—three OFZT, then one BZT, every 10th BZT round equipped with so-called "copper remover" and marked.

It is a true gun, being unable to fire much above 45° and having a long barrel and a single propelling charge. In contrast, most Western field guns of this period had a dual high and low angle fire capability, a gun-howitzer. It has a 39 calibre barrel with a tied jaw horizontal sliding-block breach and 'pepperpot' muzzle brake. The latter is not notably efficient, but subjective reports suggest that it is quite effective in reducing muzzle flash. The hydro-pneumatic recoil system comprises a buffer below the barrel and a recuperator above the barrel. The long barrel enables a substantial propelling charge by providing more length in which to achieve 'all-burnt' and hence projectile acceleration space and thus achieve its 930 m/s muzzle velocity."

It is an integral part of the BMP-2, BMD-2 and BRDM-2 vehicles. The missile is stored and carried in a fiberglass container/launch tube.The system uses a gas generator to push the missile out of the launch tube. The gas also exits from the rear of the launch tube in a similar manner to a recoilless rifle. The missile leaves the launch tube at 80 meters per second, and is quickly accelerated to 200 meters per second by its solid fuel motor. This initial high speed reduces the missile's deadzone, since it can be launched directly at the target, rather than in an upward arc. In flight, the missile spins at between five and seven revolutions per second.The launcher tracks the position of an incandescent infrared bulb on the back of the missile relative to the target and transmits appropriate commands to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile. The system has an alarm that activates when it detects jamming from a system like Shtora. The operator can then take manual control, reducing the missile to MCLOS. The SACLOS guidance system has many benefits over MCLOS. The system's accuracy is quoted in some sources as 90%, though its performance is probably comparable to the BGM-71 TOW or later SACLOS versions of the 9K11 Malyutka."

 cruisemissile_equipment_desc:0 "Cruise missiles are intermediate-range missiles that can travel long distances from where they are fired. Cruise missiles can strike strategic or battle targets and deliver heavy payloads.\nI will now explain how they find their targets.\n\nThe missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error﻿"
 
 slbm_equipment:0 "Sub Launch Ballistic Missile"
 slbm_equipment_short:0 "SLBM"
 slbm_equipment_desc:0 "SLBMs are ballistic nuclear weapons fired from submarines, they are highly dangerous weapons that can inflict immense amounts of damage and have the added benefit of making it difficult for the enemy to track or locate."

 srbm_equipment_short:0 "SRBM"
 srbm_equipment_desc:0 "SRBMs are short-range ground-based tactical ballistic nuclear weapons that can be fired from ground-based carriers. They are extremely devastating and can be used in battles to support them and obliterate the entire general area of enemy units."

 irbm_equipment_short:0 "IRBM"
 irbm_equipment_desc:0 "IRBMs are intermediate-range ground-based tactical nuclear ballistic missiles that are nest suited to engaging tactical or strategic targets. They are highly accurate and fire from fairly long ranges to destroy enemy fortifications or positions close to the front."

 icbm_equipment_short:0 "ICBM"
 icbm_equipment_desc:0 "ICBMS are long-range facility-launched strategic ballistic nuclear missiles that excel in delivering extreme amounts of damage to strategic targets and irradiating areas. ICBMs can easily be devastating to anyone or anythign they target."

 coup_equipment_desc:0 "Cheater. Can't believe you would do this, smdh. When you downloaded the mod I thought you looked like a trustworthy person. What a poor judgement of character I made.\n\nFrom now until you start a new game you must witness Sprinter [tech co-lead aka 'Starfoth'] staring at you in disappointment and judgement.\nPolarace [other tech co-lead] is also judging you but he's not shown because he cannot even bear to see your cheating, lying face."

 suicide_craft_equipment_short:0 "Suicide Plane"
 suicide_craft_equipment_desc:0 "Armed with heavy explosives and a door that cannot open after it is locked, suicide bomber planes are extremely dangerous aircraft in which the plane flies directly at an enemy position and explodes upon impact. Rendered utterly obsolete and useless by cruise missiles unless the army using them has minimal resources and access to explosives, old planes, and fanatical members."
