# How to suggest a feature, change, or enhancement
The aim of the mod is to provide a reasonably complex gameplay experience for the Cold War era. If your proposal does not fit within that scope, we may have to reject it.

Wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Iron Curtain? There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Iron Curtain has today have been added due to user request. Check the [open issues](https://github.com/swf541/Cold-War--The-Iron-Curtain/issues) to see if it has already been requested, then [open an issue](https://github.com/swf541/Cold-War--The-Iron-Curtain/issues/new/choose) which describes the feature you would like to see and how it should work.
