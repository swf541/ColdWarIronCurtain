Warning: iw_armored_vehicles = 1 should **ALWAYS** be researched!

Note: land-locked countries shouldn't have any navy researched
Note: you can put several set_technology = {} with different tech in sequence

#### Foreign equipment ####

If the army of the country uses something they cannot make (typically artillery, tanks, planes, ships), they should have it as foreign equipment. Ideally add precise name of type/class as comment. If unavailable, then use USA, ENG, FRA or SOV as creator (based on historical leanings of country).

Ships and planes are easy:

	# Mendoza-class destroyer
	ship = { name = "ARA Tucuman" definition = destroyer equipment = { destroyer_1 = { amount = 1 owner = ARG creator = ENG } } }
	
	# Coastal Group -- mostly P2Y-3A Rangers 
	nav_bomber_equipment_1 = { owner = "ARG" amount = 12 creator = USA }

Divisions are bit more complicated.. Firstly, you MUST add license creation at the **START** of OOB file if nation doesn't have any technology unlocking this equipment type or errors will show.

cost_factor = x determines how many civ factories nation will pay for this license. Ideally add names of equipment as comment.

	instant_effect = {
		SOV = {
			create_production_license = {
				target = KPA
				equipment = {
					type = artillery_equipment_1  # D-74 122 mm
				}
				cost_factor = 0
			}
			create_production_license = {
				target = KPA
				equipment = {
					type = mechanized_equipment_1 # ZiS-42
				}
				cost_factor = 1
			}
			create_production_license = {
				target = KPA
				equipment = {
					type = mbt_equipment_0 # T-34
				}
				cost_factor = 1
			}
			create_production_license = {
				target = KPA
				equipment = {
					type = motorized_equipment_1 # GAZ-64
				}
				cost_factor = 0
			}
		}
	}

Finally, all spawned divisions **MUST** have definition of what equipment should they use in order to spawn with it:

	division= {	
		name = "105th Gigab Budae"
		location = 11915
		division_template = "Maejil Gigab Doen Bunhal"
		start_experience_factor = 0.3
		start_equipment_factor = 1
		force_equipment_variants = {
			mbt_equipment_0 = { owner = "KPA" creator = "SOV" }
			mechanized_equipment_1 = { owner = "KPA" creator = "SOV" }
			motorized_equipment_1 = { owner = "KPA" creator = "SOV" }
			infantry_equipment_0 = { owner = "KPA" creator = "SOV" }
			artillery_equipment_1 = { owner = "KPA" creator = "SOV" }
		}
	}

As you can see, the division uses infantry_equipment_0 but KPA didn't get license for it from SOV. That's because they have the technology to create their own infantry_equipment_0.
	
#### GENERIC STARTING TECHS ####
Modify generic starting tech as needed - for example Argentina had jet fighter technology in 1949 (unlike other countries of similar power).
